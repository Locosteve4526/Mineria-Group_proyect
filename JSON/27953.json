        "Description/Abstract": "The authors investigate mimetic schemes for the numerical solution of partial differential equations on polygonal and polyhedral meshes. In particular, the authors develop a systematic strategy for the construction of mimetic inner products and use it to derive new numerical schemes that are consistent and compatible for partial differential equations. The advantages of the proposed strategies are illustrated on various physical problems related to Maxwell\u2019s equations.\nExplanation of Other:  Mathematical Reviews",
