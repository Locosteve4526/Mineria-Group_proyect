Drawing on three illustrative cases at Boise State University\u2014a successful program relaunch, a failed initiative, and a near-failure\u2014this study highlights the critical role of continuity planning, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive management in IB program longevity. The proposed &quot;Five Phases&quot; and &quot;Support vs. Phases&quot; models offer frameworks for understanding program lifecycle stages and aligning resources to anticipate and mitigate risks. Actionable recommendations focus on maintaining institutional knowledge, fostering strong partnerships, and ensuring adaptable frameworks. This research contributes to understudied aspects of organizational change in international academic collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;",
