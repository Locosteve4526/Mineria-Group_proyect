        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\r\nScenes of looking and watching recur throughout Journey to Love. This suggests that acts of seeing provide a poetic paradigm for the book as a whole. Not only that, they offer a way of answering the question as to what poems offer and demand of their readers. (Given his claim in &quot;Asphodel&quot; that &quot;Only the imagination is real!&quot;, one answer to this question seems to be &quot;An openness to the world and to a perception of it enlivened by the  imagination.&quot;) As in his earlier poems, in Journey to Love Williams often depicts the world in a precise, unallegorical way. In the triadic &quot;step&quot; lines\r\nthroughout the book, however, Williams also imitates the meditative mind in action. This more discursive and reflective rhetoric expands on his earlier explorations of perception, but in certain phases, it also echoes the revolutionary rebuilding of the world through imagination which Williams had called for 32 years earlier in Spring and All. In some of the best poems in Journey to Love Williams envisions the act of looking in relational terms, which prevents the book as a whole from becoming solipsistic.",
