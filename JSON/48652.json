        "Description/Abstract": "I helped establish Idaho's 4th alpine summit monitoring site in the Lemhi Mountains,as part of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA).  This work was done in partnership with a group of professional botanists, including from the BLM, U.S. Forest Service, and Idaho Fish and Game.  We collected baseline data on the vegetation at the summit of the peak, and I analyzed soil temperature data from the previous year at 3 other GLORIA summits in the Lemhis.  These data will become part of the open-access database on alpine summit vegetation worldwide, which provides opportunities for long-term monitoring and change detection in mountains as a result of climate change.",
