        "Description/Abstract": "The marginal status of contingent faculty does not have to be a source of loneliness and dissatisfaction; through collaboration, it can be a source of opportunity and self-empowerment.  This is the story of how we four contingent faculty began collaborating to improve our individual teaching, and from this discovered the support and motivation to expand beyond our day-to-day teaching into the realms of research and publishing. This resulted in a large professional development grant, numerous conference presentations, and published articles.",
