        "Description/Abstract": "Introduction: Incivility may be a problem for nursing students as they progress through their nursing education and enter the workplace. Nursing faculty are challenged to construct meaningful learning experiences to address the problem and consequences of incivility.\r\n\r\nMethod: A problem-based learning scenario and Kirkpatrick\u2019s model for evaluation were used to address incivility and the \u2018\u2018reality shock\u2019\u2019 between what students learn about the practice of nursing and the interactions they may experience in the workplace.\r\n\r\nResults: Students expressed a favorable reaction to the scenario and reported being better prepared to address incivility in the workplace.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Problem-based learning scenarios are an effective teaching strategy for instructing nursing students on the topic of incivility\r\n",
