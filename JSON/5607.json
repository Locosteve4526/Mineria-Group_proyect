        "Description/Abstract": "Herek\u2019s Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men-Short Version (ATLG-S) is widely used in research about anti-lesbian/gay bias (formerly called homophobia), yet the scale has not been validated with rigorous methods. This study addresses weaknesses identified in the original validation studies, specifically to verify the instrument\u2019s factor structure in samples of students in social work and other helping professions. We performed an exploratory factor analysis\r\nto determine if the factor structure would be reproduced as Herek had hypothesized. We tested the resulting model and a variety of other possible models\r\nusing confirmatory factor analysis with a different sample. In addition, we tested for evidence of internal consistency reliability, convergent construct, known\r\ngroups, and predictive validity. The exploratory factor analysis supported the\r\nsingle factor structure but the confirmatory factor analysis did not, requiring\r\nexcessive and inappropriate error term correlations to obtain acceptable model\r\nfit. Despite outdated items, the scale was reliable and otherwise empirically\r\nvalid. We conclude that the ATLG-S has both conceptual and empirical problems\r\nthat should be considered before use with a socially progressive sample. We suggest\r\nthat the development of the ATLG and the ATLG-S is a cautionary tale\r\nillustrating the importance of a priori theoretical conceptualization of the latent\r\nconstruct to be measured. Further, we recommend that researchers, practitioners,\r\nand educators not assume a measure\u2019s validity, and especially a short version of a validated longer measure, just because the measure appears frequently in the literature.",
