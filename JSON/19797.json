        "Description/Abstract": "Socio-economic life in the Middle East is dictated by Islamic religious practices. It is especially true for the Gulf States of the Arabian Peninsula. Much has been written and surmised about the social and economic status of women in such societies - in particularly harsh focus since 9/11. In any theory of sustainable economic development and growth, gender issues are a crucial component. Using a survey of 180 women entrepreneurs in Bahrain, this paper intends to examine the effects of changing opportunities among women who choose entrepreneurial careers in Bahrain. In particular, we attempt to measure improvements accruing to women from the constitutional amendment implemented in 2002 in which the government of Bahrain pledged to support and foster women\u2019s empowerment programs in the country.",
