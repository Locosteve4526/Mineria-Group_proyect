        "Description/Abstract": "This paper sketches out an understanding of contemporary educational forms and practices from a vantage point afforded by recent German media studies. In so doing, it introduces a number of concepts from continental media theory that have been developing in the wake of Friedrich Kittler (1943-2011). With the book \u2013both as an artifact and an epistemic metaphor\u2013 in evident decline, what is taking its place is not any one new medium, but rather a radically new kind of media systematicity. By relentlessly reducing all content (e.g., music, film, text) to ones and zeros, digitization effectively erases the material characteristics of separate media forms, leaving behind only their conventionalized aesthetic qualities. The paper builds on these arguments by concluding that the symbolic competencies which once constituted the core of all education (reading, writing, \u2018rithmatic) are increasingly at odds with performative and stylistic abilities integral to this new mediatic order.",
