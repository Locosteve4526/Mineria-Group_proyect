The prototype was designed and built to support students\u2019 understanding of the concepts of chemical equilibria and Le Chatelier\u2019s Principle. Data was collected to assess student understanding of the concepts being taught, as well as to evaluate the user experience with the prototype learning environment.&lt;/span&gt;",
