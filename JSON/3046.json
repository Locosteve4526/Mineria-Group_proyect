        "Description/Abstract": "Traditional Christian ecumenists such as Robert  Sperry Bilheimer,  educated in the ways of the World Council of Churches,  grappled with  activist &quot;new-breed&quot; church leaders over how to protest  against the  Vietnam War. During 1966-74,  Bilheimer headed the International Affairs  Commission of the National  Council of Churches of Christ in the USA  (NCC) and sought to unite the  member churches in an ecumenical effort.   Activists in the NCC, spearheaded by &quot;new-breed&quot; spokesmen, focused on   protest, however, and church leaders, who were often more liberal than   those in the pews, failed to develop consensus within their   denominations. Consequently, Bilheimer's efforts at cross-denominational  dialogue and consensus were in vain.?",
