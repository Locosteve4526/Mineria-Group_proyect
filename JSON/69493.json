        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;One of the most important problems in the research area of cryptographic functions is the construction of permutations (bijections) that have a strong resistance against differential cryptanalysis. In this talk, we introduce the notion of permutation resemblance, which is a way to measure the distance of a given polynomial over a finite field from being a permutation. We introduce an integer programming approach to compute the permutation resemblance. Moreover, using the information of permutation resemblance and integer programming methods, we give an algorithm that constructs permutations with a good resistance against differential attack.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;",
