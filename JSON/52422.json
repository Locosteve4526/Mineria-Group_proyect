Together with six Boise State Alumni and Students, we made a total of 80 Hand Medals in about 2 weeks. As Idaho's &quot;Hand Keeper&quot;, I worked with St. Luke's Hospital in Boise to get the 80 Hand Medals to frontline healthcare workers. These little Hand Medals are our small act of gratitude to show our appreciation and respect for the people on the frontlines, especially now as our COVID19 case numbers are surging. \n\nThis is a part of my Social Practice - using the power of art for community healing.\n",
