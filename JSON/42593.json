        "Description/Abstract": "Histories of educational theories, forms and practices have traditionally focused on canonical texts and terms, often beginning with those of Hellenic Greece. Looking at current textbook histories (e.g., Murphy, 2005; Gutek 2010), one might be forgiven for thinking that educational achievements began with Plato\u2019s Academy or Isocrates\u2019 Paideia. However, in recent years, other scholars have highlighted the accomplishments of non-western cultures, such as those of the Ottoman Empire (Hirschler 2012) or traditional China (Lee 2000). Looking to the ancient Middle East, this paper considers the ways in which the practices and techniques that we still associate with education and schooling\u2014particularly in its most basal forms\u2014have been manifest in very different times and places. In so doing, it seeks to challenge established albeit largely implicit histories of education, narratives that locate the origins of educational practices and techniques in the biology of the human brain (e.g., Metzloff 2009), or in the non- or pre-literate phenomena of apprenticeship (Lave and Wenger 1991) or histories of terms and ideas (Gutek 2010).
