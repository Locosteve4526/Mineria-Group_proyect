The health promoting lifestyles of Latino congregants were measured using the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II. Diabetes risk was measured by clinically standard glycated hemoglobin readings. From no risk for the disease to full blown diabetes as determined by glycated hemoglobin levels, the respondents reported engaging in basically the same levels of physical activity, monitoring of nutrition and use of health care services thus evidencing no apparent understanding of the role of lifestyle in disease management. The findings point to the imperative of a broad, comprehensive and especially culturally attuned educational campaign on basic disease pathophysiology, the value of prevention for individual health, and the necessity of day-to-day self-care should diabetes be diagnosed.\n\nPMID:\n    22610690\n    [PubMed - in process] \nPMCID:\n    PMC3515644\n    [Available on 2013/12/1] ",
