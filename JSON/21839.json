        "Description/Abstract": "During my sabbatical in Spring 2014, I was able to complete one and a half chapters of my book manuscript. Chapter one, \u201cThe Male Body and the Ill Male in the Heart of Darkness and The Nigger of the \u2018Narcissus\u2019\u201d requires further research on the latter text but is otherwise finished. The second chapter, \u201cSnowfields: \u2018On Being Ill\u2019 and a Female Artist in Woolf\u2019s The Voyage Out and H.D.\u2019s HERmione\u201d) has been useful in reaching out to the Woolf scholarship committee. The publication of Jane Elizabeth Fisher\u2019s book Envisioning Disease, Gender, and War: Women\u2019s Narratives of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, which I praised in the journal Modernism/Modernity in 2013, is one of the first books to focus on the pandemic in literature and let me to begin a correspondence with her over the summer. Our dialogue helped me to reconsider the scope of my book project and redraft its introduction.  \n\nRole:  Principal",
