        "Description/Abstract": "Electronic textbooks are increasingly marketed as alternatives to conventional hard-copy textbooks. E-texts are often presented as a win-win solution because they are assumed to provide the same educational value as hard-copy textbooks, but at a lower price and in an environmentally friendly manner. In this study, we investigate the difference between e-texts and hard-copy textbooks in terms of their learning outcomes, their carbon footprint and students\u2019 overall patterns of use.",
