        "Description/Abstract": "In order for a dye aggregate to function as a coherent quantum gate, the&lt;br&gt;excitonic state must pass through the gate on a time scale that is fast&lt;br&gt;compared to the exciton dephasing time. For the case when the input&lt;br&gt;and output are to be delivered as photonic states this also&lt;br&gt;necessitates antennas capable of intercoverting excitonic and photonic&lt;br&gt;states on a time scale that is fast compared to the exciton dephasing&lt;br&gt;time. Here we present an antenna architecture that, according to&lt;br&gt;Frenkel exciton theory, can achieve such rapid intercoversion. The&lt;br&gt;architecture consists of a superradiant antenna embedded within in a&lt;br&gt;microcavity. Coherent communication between gate input or output ports&lt;br&gt;and the large number of molecules constituting the superradiant antenna&lt;br&gt;is facilitated by a ramified exciton transmission-line network. The&lt;br&gt;combination of superradiant enhancement and Purcell enhancement by the&lt;br&gt;microcavity enables the emission or absorption rate of the antenna to&lt;br&gt;be 10$^5$ faster than the spontaneous emission rate of a single dye for&lt;br&gt;a realistic aggregate and microcavity design.",
