        "Description/Abstract": "Substantial progress has been made in many IAEA Member States in the development of small modular reactors (SMRs) as a potential option to enhance energy supply security in both developed and developing countries. In synergy with other available alternatives, SMRs can be considered as a future flexible energy source for generating electricity and industrial process\nheat, particularly for countries and/or sites for which large nuclear power plants would not be viable.\n\nThis publication provides IAEA Member States with a methodology to evaluate indicators for deploying SMRs in a national energy portfolio by analysing the key factors. It elaborates the specific attributes of SMRs and evaluates their deployment potential from the viewpoints of energy demand, finance and economics, infrastructure, climate change and energy security in an energy portfolio. The publication also uses case studies to illustrate the types of conditions that are potentially favourable to using an SMR.\n\nThis publication aims at giving Member States an enhanced capacity to apply a simplified process for country level self-assessment, with the flexibility to adapt to country specific needs. However, rather than attempting to determine or suggest whether SMRs should be adopted by a country, it provides a starting point for Member.",
