        "Description/Abstract": "Distance, Voice, and Intimacy in Mountain Interval\r\nIn Mountain Interval, Robert Frost explores issues of distance, voice, and intimacy in relation to each other.  Sometimes the distances are physical and geographical, but other times they are emotional.  Playing on the title term interval as a temporal gap or intervening space, Frost investigates the divisions between humans and the ways communication and behavior can bridge them.  In particular, he compares telephones and poetry in \u201cTelephone,\u201d \u201cAn Encounter,\u201d \u201cThe Line-Gang,\u201d and \u201cSnow.\u201d  More generally, he examines the barriers to human relationships as well as the way quotidian activities can nurture intimacy between people and emotional ties to their environment.  Frost emphasizes the metaphor of voice not only to represent speakers in action, but also to dramatize the capacities of poetry for developing and appreciating intimacy.  \r\nWhile both poems and telephones can be regarded as means to communicate via language, Frost shows how poems can model opportunities for richer, more robust and intimate relationships than any of the telephones actually do in Mountain Interval.  Even though the first transcontinental phone call linked the east and west coasts of the U.S. in 1914, Frost not only tracks the negative impact of the telephone industry on the natural world, but he also suggests that poems can successfully compete with phone technology not only by documenting a dying \u201cway of life\u201d but also by nurturing primordial bonds between humans and the natural world on which they depend.\r\n",
