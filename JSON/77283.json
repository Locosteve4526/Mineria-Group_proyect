        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) gains more acceptance in the business world, new use&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;cases are being developed for AI algorithms. For example, AI algorithms may be used to&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;perform relational work, such as interpersonal facilitation that enhances the quality of&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;social interaction between team members. Thus, AI algorithms that perform relational&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;work have the potential to enhance team effectiveness, with the greatest impact possibly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;occurring on diverse teams where team members need help working collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This study provides a theoretical framework on how AI algorithms can improve a&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;team\u2019s relational work by encouraging members of virtual teams to contribute equitably&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;to the team discussion, therefore, enhancing the team\u2019s psychological safety and&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;increasing a team\u2019s effectiveness. The theoretical framework considers how task type&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;constrains or magnifies the need for collaboration among team members, team diversity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;provides both opportunities for and threats to team effectiveness, and AI algorithm type&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;moderates the effect of team diversity on team effectiveness and its mediators.&lt;/p&gt;",
