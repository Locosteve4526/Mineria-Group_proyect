Please review the MOU in detail and respond to this email with either your physical signature or electronic confirmation that you would like to participate in the grant. With your approval, we will seek your Department Chair, Dean, Provost, and VPR signatures to ensure that everyone is committed to you and your ideas (this is a requirement for participating). Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.",
