        "Description/Abstract": "In a 1919 paper on Lebesgue measure zero sers of real numbers, Borel introduced a covering property. Ten years later in an unrelated investigation F.P. Ramsey published a result now known as Ramsey's Theorem. On account of work over the last two decades or so, Borel's covering property and Ramsey theory are now inextricably linked. In this talk we give a brief report on this confluence of mathematical themes.",
