        "Description/Abstract": "In the struggle for securing food for the growing population around the world,\nfood waste has been a major drawback. Globally, one third of food production\n\nis lost and wasted in the food supply chain, with a significant footprint on nat-\nural resources (e.g., annual 250 km3 blue water consumption). Food waste is\n\nindeed one of the most daunting problems facing human being. It consumes\na significant amount of valuable and partially nonrenewable resources, such as\n\nwater and energy, and renders significant detrimental health and environmen-\ntal impacts due to spoilage, decomposition, and leachate. In this study, we\n\ninvestigate a global picture of food waste in the context of water-food-energy\nnexus through literature review and data analysis. We analyze the imprints of\nfood waste on water and energy resources and discuss its ethical implication\nfor: (1) wasting valuable resources, in many cases, to a level that cannot be\nnaturally replaced, and (2) leaving detrimental and long-lasting impacts on the\nenvironment. This paper demonstrates that impacts of food waste transcend\nthe political boundaries, and highlights the need for transfer of technological\nmeasures and tactical experiences from developed to developing countries to\nreduce food waste. A huge portion of food waste in developed countries occur at the consumer level, whereas developing countries waste a significant quantity\nof food earlier in the supply chain. While both categories benefit from increase\nin public awareness, the latter category is in need of technological support and\ninvestment in the food transfer and storage stages. Reducing food waste should\nbe actively followed as a way for food provision for a growing population.",
