        "Description/Abstract": "Entomological surveillance has been a component of an ongoing, multi-year study of malaria transmission and its control in a region of high transmission of NE Uganda. The An. gambiae and An. funestus mosquito species complexes are the primary malaria vectors in the area and we report on their seasonal and locational trends, and associated patterns of malaria transmission. As part of the study, two of three connected subcounties received indoor residual spraying (IRS) with pirimiphos methyl, while all received bednets through a universal campaign from Uganda\u2019s Ministry of Health. Mosquitoes in the subcounties, with and without these interventions, are collected for a single night at monthly intervals with CDC light traps in 90 sentinel huts for nearly three years. Evident in these collections are two time-ordered, independent vector density peaks, and each is strongly dominated by a single species. These sequential, species-specific population trends are repeated annually, an apparent interspecific interaction. Despite this seasonal coordination, a spatially complex picture of the mosquito densities is also found, indicating both species are frequently sympatric, but not syntopic, in the study area. The impacts of IRS are strongly evident on the mosquito densities, with percentage reductions generally around 70-80% compared to neighboring regions with only the universal bednets, and it is somewhat more effective on the An. funestus population. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the research setting allows a practical estimation of the number of observation huts sufficient to infer different vector control impacts, with implications for programmatic entomological surveillance.",
