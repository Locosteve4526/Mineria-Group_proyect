        "Description/Abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of altitude differences on the outcomes of NCAA Division I FBS college football games over the past 23 years. Using data from 14,874 games played between 2001 and 2023, we assess how the altitude difference between home and away teams affects both win probabilities and point spreads. We find that home teams playing at higher altitudes than their opponents have a statistically significant advantage. Specifically, teams with a positive altitude spread exhibit a 3.69% higher probability of winning, as well as an average 1.5 to 3.0 point spread advantage. This advantage is particularly pronounced when the altitude difference is extreme. Our analysis highlights how environmental factors such as altitude can play a critical role in competitive outcomes, engendering significant effect for both sports betting markets and broader economic decision making in college football.",
