        "Description/Abstract": "We surveyed psychology departments nationwide to determine the most important issues in undergraduate psychology education via an Introduction to the Psychology Major course. This type of course is becoming popular, with 34.2% of reporting departments offering such a course. Respondents rated 33 undergraduate education issues with respect to importance. We discuss these results in the context of increasing popularity of the psychology major and the course-based method of communicating academic and career advising information to students.",
