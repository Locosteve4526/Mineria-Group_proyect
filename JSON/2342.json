        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the instructional effectiveness of different navigation modes (linear and nonlinear) in facilitating achievement of students identified as possessing different levels of prior knowledge. Sixty-eight undergraduate students were randomly assigned to treatments and received four criterion tests designed to measure different educational objectives immediately after interacting with their respective instruction. Results indicated that insignificant differences in achievement existed between treatments on each criterion measure. Interaction between navigation mode and prior knowledge level was also found to be insignificant. Findings indicated that alternative navigation strategies, although structurally different, may not be functionally different and that differences in navigation strategies do not compensate for differences in prior knowledge.
