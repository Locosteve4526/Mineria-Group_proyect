        "Description/Abstract": "Nurse leaders depend upon resiliency skills to support their practice. It is important to provide&lt;br&gt;opportunities for nursing students to learn, practice, and observe these skills, which are needed&lt;br&gt;to navigate challenging work environments. This article describes the impact of a resiliency curricular&lt;br&gt;component in a grant-funded BSN elective course, Concepts of Primary Care. Program&lt;br&gt;evaluation was performed using a pre/posttest format and 2 surveys, the Brief Resilience Scale&lt;br&gt;(BRS) and the Brief Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS). Three open-ended questions were administered&lt;br&gt;upon completion of the elective course. A concurrent nested design was utilized with&lt;br&gt;a thematic analysis undertaken to analyze qualitative data. Analysis of quantitative data was performed&lt;br&gt;using descriptive statistics. Undergraduate BSN students showed an overall increase in&lt;br&gt;resiliency (BRS: P = .112; BCRS: P = .064), and responses to open-ended questions supported&lt;br&gt;the ability to apply and analyze most of the resiliency skills presented during the didactic portion&lt;br&gt;of the elective course. This course promoted the development and refinement of undergraduate&lt;br&gt;BSN student resilience skills. Integration of resilience content in the primary care course also&lt;br&gt;supported student professional development. The addition of resiliency concepts and skills into&lt;br&gt;undergraduate nursing curricula is recommended to enhance the ability of novice nurses to ad[&lt;br&gt;AQ1] dress work-related challenges and promote career satisfaction for the future",
