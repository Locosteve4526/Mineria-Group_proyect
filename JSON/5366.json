        "Description/Abstract": "We study several schemas for generating from one sort of open cover of a topological space a second sort of open cover. Some of these schemas come from classical literature, others are borrowed from the theory of ultra?lters on the set of positive integers. We show that the fact that such a schema actually succeeds in producing a cover imposes strong combinatorial structure on the family of open covers of a certain sort. In particular, we show that certain analogues of Ramsey's theorem characterize some of these circumstances.",
