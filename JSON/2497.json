        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\n\nBacterial quorum sensing is mediated by autoinducers, small signaling molecules generated by bacteria. It has been proposed that the LuxS enzyme converts S-ribosyl-L-homocysteine to 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione, the precursor of autoinducer 2 (AI-2). We report here a chemical synthesis of S-ribosyl-L-homocysteine and its analogue using Mitsunobu coupling. Chemically synthesized ribosylhomocysteine has been confirmed as a substrate for LuxS in both an enzyme assay and a whole cell quorum sensing assay. The chemical entities of products from the LuxS reaction were also established. Several ribosylhomocysteine analogues have been tested as LuxS inhibitors.\n",
