        "Description/Abstract": "The concept of the \u201cfocus factory\u201d has been touted as an operational strategy that can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and allow for firm differentiation. While originally conceptualized in the context of products, the focus strategy has also been extended and researched in the service industries. Recently, there have been additional emphasis on understanding the effects of a focus strategy in the healthcare context. However, focus as a concept has been measured in a variety of ways. With multiple measurements of focus in the literature, appropriate measurability of the concept becomes necessary. Such measurement issues also cause theoretical gaps. To bridge the methodological and theoretical gaps, this research addresses consistency and validity of measurement with regard to focus in hospitals. The measures are then applied to examine both antecedents and consequences of hospital focus and demonstrate consistency.",
