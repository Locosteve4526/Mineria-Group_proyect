        "Description/Abstract": "In this paper, I examine the impact of winning and losing in\r\nparliamentary systems on protest behavior. I argue that losers in\r\nparliamentary systems with single party, majority governments are more\r\nlikely to protest than losers in systems with coalition governments. In\r\nthe empirical analysis, I provide support for my argument using data from\r\nthe Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) survey from 2001-2006.\r\nThe results suggest that losers in single party, majority systems were\r\nmore likely to protest than their counterparts in coalition systems. In\r\naddition, while it is unclear whether winning and losing had an effect on\r\nprotest behavior in coalition systems, losers in single party, majority\r\nsystems were more likely to protest than winners.",
