        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract As businesses continue to face stakeholder pressure to adopt more sustainable and\nresponsible practices, business schools must also adapt to changing demands and redesign\ncurricula to include sustainability topics. This paper analyzes the use of community-based\nlearning as an approach to integrating sustainability in supply chain management curriculum. To\naid the development of such opportunities, the constructs of uncertainty and integration are\npresented with linkages to Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy. Two cases of project development and\nimplementation illustrate the potential learning outcomes and highlight challenges and risks one\nmay expect before embarking on the journey to innovate pedagogical approaches. This paper\naims to provide ideas and examples of ways to both enhance the learning experience for students\nwhile concurrently developing action research opportunities for educators and scholars.\nKeywords: sustainability, community-based learning, pedagogy, Operations, Supply Chain\nManagement.",
