        "Description/Abstract": "This poster presentation will share how two librarians at two different institutions successfully recast the narrative about the common reading program on their campuses by moving away from traditional print materials to open access materials, such as long form web publications and library subscriptions databases, and provided access via library web tools, such as Springshare. The poster will include an overview of the histories of the common reader programs on each respective campus, implementation details, and assessment data of the new common reading program.",
