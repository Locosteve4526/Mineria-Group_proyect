        "Description/Abstract": "The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic placed increased pressure on community corrections to adapt their supervision strategies to adhere to agency-level, state-level, and nationwide health measures. As a consequence of these rapid changes, probation and parole officers (PPOs) were forced to change how they approached their work. Despite such fundamental changes, little research has explored how PPOs responded to such operational changes including whether the pandemic impacted feelings of stress and burnout over time. Using three waves of semi-structured qualitative interviews with American PPOs, the current study examined: 1) the main sources of PPO stress and burnout including how officers\u2019 experiences changed over time, and 2) the strategies or coping mechanisms PPOs used to manage their wellbeing over time. Results from thematic analysis suggested most PPOs were not initially stressed during the onset of the pandemic but inconsistent messaging and limited organizational support contributed to rising stress and burnout over time. Findings also indicated that when agencies implemented policies that supported PPOs\u2019 ability to work from home, such adjustments served as key coping mechanisms. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.",
