        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;br&gt;College students, particularly international students, face unique challenges related to&lt;br&gt;mental health and academic performance. Previous studies have shown that stress,&lt;br&gt;loneliness and psychological distress significantly impact both domestic and&lt;br&gt;international students, but the extent and predictors of these issues may vary between&lt;br&gt;groups.&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;Data were drawn from 102,905 respondents in the 2022 American College Health&lt;br&gt;Association\u2019s National College Health Assessment, including 89,663 domestic and 13,242&lt;br&gt;international students. A cross-sectional secondary analysis using logistic regression&lt;br&gt;examined associations between stress and variables such as loneliness, psychological&lt;br&gt;distress, and academic outcomes.&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;Stress significantly predicted loneliness, psychological distress, and educational&lt;br&gt;challenges in both groups. International students had slightly higher odds of&lt;br&gt;experiencing loneliness (AOR = 1.508) and academic distress (AOR = 4.467) than domestic&lt;br&gt;students.&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;The findings of this study underscore the importance of understanding the distinct&lt;br&gt;mental health challenges faced by domestic and international college students.&lt;br&gt;Conclusion&lt;br&gt;Tailored mental health interventions and social integration initiatives are essential to&lt;br&gt;addressing the unique challenges of international students and promoting their well-being and academic success.&lt;/p&gt;",
