        "Description/Abstract": "Joint inversion is technique frequently applied to problems in the physical sciences. It can improve the conditioning of a problem as well as the accuracy of the inverse solutions. We present a mathematical analysis of joint inversion in regard to the regularization of ill-conditioned problems in geophysical electromagnetic imaging. The discrete linear case is examined most thoroughly as it provides the foundation for non-linear problems to be solved iteratively.",
