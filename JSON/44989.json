        "Description/Abstract": "How do citizens within countries hosting US military bases view that US military presence? Until now, studies have relied on aggregate figures of public opinion toward the United States in general, along with anecdotal accounts of reactions to high profile incidents involving US military personnel. We use a new data set that utilizes geolocation to examine public opinion toward the US military presence and the United States in general within fourteen US military base hosts. We find that US military bases have a polarizing effect on public opinion in regions nearby American installations. Citizens near military installations polarize based on whether the citizen receives an economic benefit from the US presence, with economic beneficiaries becoming more positive, and most others trending toward more negative opinions of the US and its military presence. Areas further away from installations show the majority of citizens merging toward neutral attitudes. This study has profound implications for the role that US installations play in affecting the social fabric of host nations, along with policy implications for the conduct of American military activities outside the United States.",
