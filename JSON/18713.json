        "Description/Abstract": "Libraries are never short on innovation, especially when budgets are lean. How can staff stay on top of the latest library trends, and empower individuals to think \u201clean and mean\u201d when times demand creativity? One solution, developed in Idaho during a summit on developing services for digital natives, was to create a Special Projects Library Action Team (SPLAT). SPLAT members act in the crow\u2019s nest capacity of technological change. They search and share innovative ideas, leads on projects, and experiment in social media statewide; vet ideas; and bring ideas back to the local level. Supported by the Idaho Commission for Libraries (ICFL), the group has a statewide focus, and members hold a wide range of perspectives and library experiences. Two SPLAT members present methods you can bring back to your communities to encourage collaboration, innovation, and creativity that will benefit your greater community.",
