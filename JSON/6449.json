        "Description/Abstract": "Motivation is key to engaging students in meaningful and productive work. Identifying individual students' interests would be ideal, but in the real world, we need to create and sustain &quot;situational interest.&quot; Smith and Wilhelm reference their own research as well as other research that is contextually very different to show how the same principles of providing choice (to promote a personal connection) and supporting competence (through the teaching of immediately useful strategies) resulted in motivation that deepened learning.",
