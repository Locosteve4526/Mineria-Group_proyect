        "Description/Abstract": "In a contemporary and comprehensive analysis of politics and public  policy in the American West, Clive Thomas makes the case that one of the  most significant factors driving the policy-making process in the West  is the marked rise in the intensity of conflict between urban and rural  areas. More importantly, Thomas specifically links this rural-urban  tension to environmental issues. He argues that environmental and  quality of life issues are likely to be the most significant factors  facing policy makers as the Intermountain West continues to urbanize.  Using counties as the unit of analysis, we investigate this rural-urban  linkage to environmental policy making in the state of Idaho. Analysis  is based upon both aggregate county data and survey of government elites  (county officials). Our findings suggest that critical differences  remain between urban and rural areas with respect to concern for the  environment.",
