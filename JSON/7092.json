        "Description/Abstract": "How and where do participatory institutions contribute to the deepening  of democracy? Substantial variation in the outcomes produced by  participatory institutions is best explained by the incentives of  elected governments to delegate authority and the capacity of civil  society organizations to use contentious politics in and outside of  these institutions. In eight cases of Brazil's participatory budgeting  program, two municipalities produced strong results; two other  municipalities produced failed programs; and four municipalities  produced mixed, somewhat contradictory results. Failed programs can have  a pernicious effect on efforts to deepen democracy, while the most  successful programs improve the quality of local democratic processes.",
