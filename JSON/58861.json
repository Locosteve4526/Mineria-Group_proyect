        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Focus, also known as specialization, has been hypothesized to reduce the cost of care while simultaneously improving the outcomes of patients. While focused (specialized) hospitals range from standalone specialty hospitals to hospitals choosing to emphasize on certain condition(s), there are limitations in the conceptualization of \u201cfocus as an emphasis\u201d within a hospital. This study attempts to distinguish between hospital service diversification and &quot;focus as an emphasis&quot; to assess their impact on the cost and quality of care. Additionally, the study looks at the moderating effect of the hospital's size on the hospital's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;",
