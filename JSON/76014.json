        "Description/Abstract": "Implementation and hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials aspire to speed the translation of science into practice by generating crucial evidence for improving the uptake of effective health interventions. By design, they pose unique recruitment and retention challenges due to their aims, units of analysis, and sampling plans, which typically require many clinical sites (i.e. often 20 or more) and participation by individuals who are related across multiple levels (e.g. linked organizational leaders, clinicians, and patients). In this article, we present a new multilevel, theory-informed, and relationship-centered framework for conceptualizing recruitment and retention in implementation and hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials which integrates and builds on prior work on recruitment and retention strategies in patient-focused trials. We describe the framework's application in the Working to Implement and Sustain Digital Outcome Measures hybrid type III trial, which occurred in part during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
