        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;The stated objective of the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are to serve as a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity around the planet. If this blueprint is to become a reality, the inclusion of the SDGs in university curricula is essential. Yet how can we be sure that we teach a unified and shared view of these goals? This paper examines the value of using virtual exchange in teaching the UN SDGs in Business School Design Thinking courses. Specifically, the experience of a partnered course run at both the Boise State University\u2019s College of Business and Economics and the Lebanese American University\u2019s Adnan Kassar School of Business serves as a case-study. Results from a survey of both student groups indicate that the experience of working with students from outside their home culture did improve their cross-cultural communication skills. Furthermore, learning about the SDGs was a valued experience. However, learning about the SDGs in collaboration with \u201cforeign\u201d team members was eclipsed by the broader experience of engaging with students outside their home culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Design Thinking, Virtual Exchange, Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/p&gt;",
