        "Description/Abstract": "Mass drug administration (MDA) is one of the suggested means to accelerate efforts towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status. There is limited evidence of optimum methods of implementing MDA programme to achieve a high coverage and compliance in low income countries. We describe experience of implementing a population-based MDA using dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DHA-PQ) delivered by fixed point distribution for the first dose and door-to-door follow up for the second and third doses in Kapujan sub-county, an area of high malaria transmission in North Eastern Uganda.\n\nMass drug administration was implemented in a study to assess the impact of population- based MDA in combination with indoor residual spraying (IRS) and IRS alone in a high transmission setting in Uganda. Four rounds of interventions are planned over a period of two years at six months intervals. A housing and population census was conducted to establish the eligible population. All household members were assigned individual barcodes for identification. The first dose of DHA-PQ was administered by directly observed treatment on site, the remaining doses were taken at home. Community health workers followed participants to monitor adherence to the second and third doses.\n\nBased on number of individuals who turned up at the distribution site, of 14,468 eligible persons, MDA coverage was 81%, 75% and 80% for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd rounds respectively. Treatment adherence to all three doses in round one, was not captured but for second round was 76% and 75% for second and third doses and 80% for all doses in third round. Intense community mobilization using community structures and mass media facilitated community participation and adherence to MDA. A hybrid of fixed site distribution and door-to-door follow up strategy of MDA delivery achieved a high coverage and compliance. This model can be considered in resource limited settings.  ",
