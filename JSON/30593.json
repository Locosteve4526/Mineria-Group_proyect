        "Description/Abstract": "It is still an open problem to decide when each (oriented) link in an oriented 3-manifold has a finite skein tree of Conway resolutions with all leaves in a set of standard links. Here we define a set of standard links by\r\nchoosing one isotopy class of links within each homotopy class of links. In hyperbolic 3-manifolds a natural standard set of links can be constructed from the set of primitive geodesics (with base points and framings).\r\nThen each link within sufficiently small Hausdorff distance to a link in a specific subset of standard links has a finite skein tree. We will discuss some ideas how length function and link characteristic can be used to\r\ndefine complexity functions, which might be useful in proving the existence of finite skein trees in more general cases.",
