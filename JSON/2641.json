        "Description/Abstract": "In French filmmaker Coline Serreau's Chaos, female characters flee the urban status quo, live through (and thrive in) moments of chaos, and finally end their travels in a pastoral seaside home. In depicting a cinematic trip to a seemingly feminine utopia, the film addresses a societal problem that remains under-represented in mainstream cinema: gender inequality and, in particular, transcultural gender inequality. In analyzing Serreau's gendered approach to utopian fiction, I demonstrate how Chaos manipulates seemingly classic Hollywood narrative form and style to question the gendered status quo of modern Parisian society.",
