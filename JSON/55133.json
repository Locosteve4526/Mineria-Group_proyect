        "Description/Abstract": "SUMMARY\nThe Gateway Scholars Program (GSP) has provided meaningful support for students in the biological sciences through 40 scholarships, mentorship for scholars, a focus on evidence-based teaching practices, encouraging undergraduate research opportunities, risk-based advising, and co-curricular activities designed to support greater understanding of opportunities for biology graduates. These efforts have been described as beneficial by the students surveyed and interviewed for this project. \nThe grant activities have helped the department identify areas for improvement and to leverage the grant with the university leadership and partners.  The major accomplishments and broader impacts of the grant thus far are: \n\u25cf\tIncreased advising support for biology students through the College of Arts and Sciences (COAS) where biology majors and transfer students with fewer than 14 credit hours are served by the professional advisor Maribel Saucedo-Gonzalez \n\u25cf\tAdditional Biology advisor, Alex Urquhart (lecturer) provides an extra half-time advisor for majors\n\u25cf\tCentralized support for STEM departments to provide outreach to students through early alert (as described in objective 2)\n\u25cf\tCreated a \u201cstudent group\u201d to track undergraduate research participation in the student information system\n\u25cf\tEstablished the benefit of an introductory course for Gateway biology majors and subsequently for any biology student \n\u25cf\tCollaboration between the GSP leadership team and the biology club has strengthened the co-curricular offerings of the department\n\u25cf\tEstablished mentor training, student engagement, and diversity/inclusion discussion topics as a regular feature of faculty meetings\n\u25cf\tThe DFW rates in core biology courses are inversely related to the increased use of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) by biology faculty members. This finding is consistent with the scholarship on the use of EBIPs as effective pedagogy for all students (objectives 3 and 5) \n\u25cf\tDeveloped a self-efficacy and professional identity scale specific to the biological sciences (objective 5)\nA primary objective of our grant activities was to shift the culture of the Department of Biological Sciences (DBS) to increase learning-centeredness and focus on engaging students. The activities included in this project, in addition to efforts in the department resulting from other funded work, are positively impacting GSP students and other biology majors. \n",
