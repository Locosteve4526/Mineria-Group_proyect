        "Description/Abstract": "A body of literature has amassed in recent years examining risk factors and outcomes for children who have experienced various forms of trauma. Childhood maltreatment in various forms has commonly been termed adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which are severe enough to negatively impact mental and physical health in both childhood and adulthood, as well as lead to a variety of undesirable life outcomes for affected adults. Less has been studied regarding the cyclical nature of child maltreatment and the effects that parents\u2019 own history of childhood trauma may have on their children\u2019s experience of trauma. Recent research has evaluated intervention strategies such as evidence-based home visiting (EBHV) programs for mothers and infants/toddlers that address this phenomenon and aims to interrupt the cycle of maltreatment. The benefits of home visiting will be reviewed and policy and cost implications related to preventive intervention are discussed.",
