        "Description/Abstract": "Harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp.) ants are considered agricultural pests in many areas of western North America because of their nesting and foraging activities in crops and rangeland. We conducted a field test of Amdro\u00ae granular ant baits (active ingredient: hydramethylnon) for the targeted removal of Owyhee harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex salinus Olsen, colonies in southwestern Idaho sagebrush-steppe. We found that a single application of two tablespoons of the pesticide was sufficient to kill colonies. Ants rapidly collected the insecticide granules and delivered them below ground into their nests. Within 24 h many ants on the surface of treated nests were either dead or impaired. Most treated colonies were completely inactive when observations were repeated two weeks after application and again the following year. We discuss targeted control of P. salinus colonies for use in recovery efforts of slickspot peppergrass, Lepidium papilliferum, a threatened mustard endemic to southwest Idaho. Populations of L. papilliferum overlap extensively with P. salinus colonies, and its seeds are vulnerable to predation by these ants.",
