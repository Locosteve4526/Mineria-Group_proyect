        "Description/Abstract": "The digitization of intellectual property has a substantial influence on the\nefficiency and effectiveness of modular production systems, which are a\nfast-emerging digitalization trend. Within interfirm modular production\nsystems sensitive data and information are exchanged to facilitate the\nmanufacturing process, and the compartmentalization inherent to\nmodular processes has been viewed as a way to protect a firm\u2019s\nintellectual property. However, this view ignores that reality that\nmodularity creates a stable and replicable criminal opportunity structure.\nWe address the risks to intellectual property protection that exist within\nmodular production systems that rely upon digitized information and\ndata, and develop six propositions to guide future theory, research and\npractice. These propositions identify inherent risks, as well as strategies\nthat can guide the situational application of risk mitigation and crime\nprevention activities. ",
