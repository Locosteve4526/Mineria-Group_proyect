        "Description/Abstract": "Martyrdom is widely considered to be a critical part of Christian identity. However, the wide-ranging application of this conclusion in scholarship reveals its continued indebtedness to a theological understanding of martyrdom. Martyrdom necessarily includes the death of the martyr and the overwhelming majority of Christians have not been martyrs. Thus, in a very real sense, martyrdom is not part of Christian identity. The seeming malleability of martyrdom reveals the substitution of the martyr\u2019s death with a theological construct that might be called 'willingness to suffer.\u2019 This substitution is enabled by the use of 'identity,\u2019 a term that is characterized by imprecise boundaries between categories of analysis and of practice. Enabled by this imprecision, scholarship on martyrdom has sought to recreate the Christian group identity of martyrdom on an individual level. This has lead to theses about the widespread development of Christian martyrdom based on limited evidence that perpetuates misunderstandings about intentional self-death. I propose that when studying Christian martyrdom, we intentionally isolate the theological justifications that support \u2018willingness to suffer,' which are broadly inculcated in Christian self-understanding, from the act of martyrdom itself. This will allow the exploration of the comparatively rare phenomenon of martyrdom from non-theological perspectives as well closer analysis of how martyrdom's existential impact has been leveraged in Christian institution-building.\n",
