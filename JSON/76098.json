        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;This panel explores the value of performance assessments in language teaching, offering practical, classroom-tested strategies to measure student performance across the three modes of communication. The session begins with an overview of performance assessments: what they are, why they matter, and how they enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Four language professors will then present concrete formative and summative assessment ideas that they've implemented successfully, ranging from project-based evaluations to real-world communicative tasks, all of which are adaptable to various language learning contexts. Each presenter\u2019s approach, grounded in research and classroom practice, is designed to evaluate learners' ability to use language in an authentic task and to motivate student engagement. Following the presentations, the panel will engage with the audience in a discussion, addressing questions, providing resources, and offering strategies for incorporating these assessments into different teaching environments. Participants will gain access to a Padlet with the assessment examples and all the resources included, helping them implement performance assessments in their own language classrooms.&lt;/span&gt;",
