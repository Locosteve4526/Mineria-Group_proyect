        "Description/Abstract": "The central challenge for the temporal realist is providing a coherent  analysis of temporal passage, the apparent 'flow' of time from earlier  to later. I show here how the account of time Aristotle presents in  Physics IV could serve as a basis for just such an analysis, for his  view is immune to the standard stock of objections leveled by twentieth  century philosophers. And although his account is itself subject to a  damning objection, I believe that the troublemaking element might be  supplanted by alternative views suited to fulfill the requisite  theoretical role. I conclude that, subject to such revision, an  Aristotelian conception of time looks to be the leading candidate.",
