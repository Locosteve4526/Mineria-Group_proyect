        "Description/Abstract": "This presentation explores the ongoing women's soccer league age rule antitrust litigation Moultrie v. NWSL, specifically in regards to its the questions this litigation raises about when and how courts must defer to collective bargaining in labor-related disputes.  In doing so, this presentation expands discussion of this litigation into a broader discussion of the scope of this deference in two key areas: the nonstatutory labor exemption and Norris-LaGuardia\u2019s anti-injunction provision. In doing so, this presentation invites debate on whether such deference should be broadly or narrowly applied and when, how, and why this deference should be applied at all.",
