        "Description/Abstract": "This book is intended to offer college faculty members the insights of the development of reasoning movement that enlighten physics educators in the late 1970s and led to a variety of college programs directed at improving the reasoning patterns used by college students. While the original materials were directed at physics concepts, they quickly expanded to include other sciences and the humanities and social sciences. On-going developments in the field will be included.The editors have introduced new topics, including discussions of Vygotsky's ideas in relation to those of Piaget, of science education research progress since 1978, of constructivist learning theory applied to educational computer games and of applications from anthropology to zoology. These materials are especially relevant for consideration by current university faculty in all subjects.",
