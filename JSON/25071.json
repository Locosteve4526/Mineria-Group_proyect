        "Description/Abstract": "Deception detection is an important task in forensics and security. Criminals and terrorists are highly motivated to deceive, and people are not good in detecting deception without technological assistance. Traditional approaches to assist in the deception detection task have made use of physiological cues measured from the suspect in a controlled environment. To date, only the polygraph has achieved widespread application in forensics. Although there is controversy, research suggests that in forensic settings the polygraph is about 90% accurate in discriminating truth-tellers from deceivers. This is a considerable improvement over na\u010fve deception detection. Research has examined other physiological measures. Voice stress analysis, although used in forensics, is without demonstrated scientific validity. Recent research suggests that ocular-motor measures may be able to provide high validity deception detection even in screening settings.\r\n\r\n",
