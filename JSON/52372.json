        "Description/Abstract": "Mechanical testing machines used in cadaveric spine biomechanics research vary between labs. It is a necessary first step to understand the capabilities and limitations in any testing machine prior to publishing experimental data. In this study, a reproducible protocol that uses a synthetic spine was developed and used to quantify the inherent rotation error and the ability to apply loads in a single physiologic plane (pure-moment) of a custom spine biomechanics simulator. Rotation error was evaluated by comparing data collected by the test machine and the data collected by an optical motion capture system. Pure-moment loading was assessed by comparing the out-of-plane loads to the primary plane load. Using synthetic functional spine units previously shown to have mechanics similar to the cadaveric human spine, the simulator was evaluated using a dynamic test protocol reflective of its future use in the study of cadaveric spine specimens. Rotation errors inherent in the test machine were &lt;0.25\u00b0 compared to motion capture. Out of plane loads were &lt;4.0% of the primary plane load, which confirmed pure-moment loading. The authors suggest that a standard validation protocol for biomechanical spine testing machines is needed for transparency and accurate field-wide data interpretation and comparison. We offer recommendations based on the reproducible use of a synthetic spinal specimen for consideration.",
