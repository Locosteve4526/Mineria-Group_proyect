        "Description/Abstract": "\r\nCorporate reporting has historically focused on the disclosure of \u201cmaterial\u201d information to shareholders.  The rise of sustainability reporting challenges the traditional definition of materiality by expanding the range of information users beyond shareholders.  However, the two dominant sustainability reporting frameworks \u2013 the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the International Integrated Reporting framework (IIRC) \u2013 appear to differ in their definitions of this key concept.  The GRI framework explicitly includes \u201cstakeholders\u201d in its definition of materiality; the IIRC does not. This project investigates reports prepared under each of these frameworks to discern how reporters interpret the definitions and concept of \u201cmaterial\u201d information.\r\n",
