        "Description/Abstract": "More than 40 years of culturally responsive education has yet to bridge the gap between indigenous and mainstream students.  Understanding indigenous learning systems can mitigate conflicts between local ecological knowledge and formal education.  We compare schooling and local knowledge acquisition for children and adults belonging to a Scheduled Tribe in South India.   Student attendance and performance at school negatively correlates with local knowledge for children.  Adult theoretical knowledge also negatively correlates with years of schooling, but practical skills show little or slightly positive correlation.  Cultural learning patterns and opportunity costs for acquiring different types of knowledge explain these trends.\r\nPartners:  Villages of Chottepare, Diddali, Diddali Colony, Basavanalli, and Thathalli\r\nDescription of Partner:  Indigenous villages experience tension between schooling and local knowledge which contributed to data collection and will benefit from this report\r\nRole:  Principal",
