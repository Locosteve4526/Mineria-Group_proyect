        "Description/Abstract": "We surveyed directors of departmental search committees (N = 89) to ascertain which criteria have the most value in the faculty applicant selection process. Respondents used several methodological techniques, including rank order, agreement, and importance scale questions. Results indicated that match or fit with department is the most important criterion in applicant selection, followed by research and teaching experience. Important differences emerged in the evaluation of job applicants depending on the type of institution (public vs. private) or type of department (undergraduate-only vs. undergraduate + graduate program).",
