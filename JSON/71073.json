        "Description/Abstract": "The paper recognizes AI as another tool that students might readily accept. However, AI grading introduces a novel dimension, as it evaluates not only grammar but also essay content, considering specific criteria set by professors or more general aspects like essay coherence and argument structure. This study aims to bridge the gap in literature by comparing the perceptions of AI grading against those of professors and graduate students, focusing on short essays with identical scoring criteria",
