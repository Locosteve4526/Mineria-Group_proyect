        "Description/Abstract": "We describe a parallel, adaptive, multi-block algorithm for explicit\r\nintegration of time dependent partial differential equations on two-dimensional\r\nCartesian grids. The grid layout we consider consists of a nested hierarchy of\r\nfixed size, non-overlapping, logically Cartesian grids stored as leaves in a\r\nquadtree. Dynamic grid refinement and parallel partitioning of the grids is\r\ndone through the use of the highly scalable quadtree/octree library p4est.\r\nBecause our concept is multi-block, we are able to easily solve on a variety of\r\ngeometries including the cubed sphere. In this paper, we pay special attention\r\nto providing details of the parallel ghost-filling algorithm needed to ensure\r\nthat both corner and edge ghost regions around each grid hold valid values.\r\n  We have implemented this algorithm in the ForestClaw code using single-grid\r\nsolvers from ClawPack, a software package for solving hyperbolic PDEs using\r\nfinite volumes methods. We show weak and strong scalability results for scalar\r\nadvection problems on two-dimensional manifold domains on 1 to 64Ki MPI\r\nprocesses, demonstrating neglible regridding overhead.\r\n[Journal_ref: ]",
