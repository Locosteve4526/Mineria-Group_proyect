        "Description/Abstract": "Background: Theory  suggests that the accuracy of metacognitive monitoring is affected by  the cues used to judge learning. Researchers have improved monitoring  accuracy by directing attention to more appropriate cues; however, this  is the first study to more directly point students to more appropriate  cues using instructions regarding tests and practice tests.\nAims: The  purpose of the present study was to examine whether the accuracy  metacognitive monitoring was affected by the nature of the test  expected.\nSample and method: Students (N=  59) were randomly assigned to one of two test expectancy groups (memory  vs. inference). Then after reading texts, judging learning, completed  both memory and inference tests.\nResults: Test  performance and monitoring accuracy were superior when students  received the kind of test they had been led to expect rather than the  unexpected test.\nConclusion. Tests  influence students' perceptions of what constitutes learning. Our  findings suggest that this could affect how students prepare for tests  and how they monitoring their own learning.",
