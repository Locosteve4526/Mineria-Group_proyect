        "Description/Abstract": "Santiaguito Volcano, Guatemala, has been erupting since 1922, following the cataclysmic eruption of Santa Maria Volcano in 1902. In 2007 and 2009 we recorded data using campaign-style seismo-acoustic networks to monitor the dome explosions that occurred once per hour, on average, on the active (Caliente) dome. This year we returned with a new seismic deployment focused on observations of ultra-long period signals recorded near the flanks of the active dome. We established three stations (two with tilt) in a triangular array northeast of Caliente within 500 m of the erupting edifice. Explosion activity in 2012 is noticeably different than 2009: the rate of explosive degassing has slowed considerably and coincides with elevated effusion of lava and apparent increase in degassing unassociated with explosions. Prior to explosions tilt signals are occasionally evident. Inflationary tilt signals typically start 10 minutes before explosion onsets and rapid deflation follows the explosions. Tilt is not observed for every seismic degassing signal, suggesting that there are variations in source dynamics and explosion geometry. Infrasound at Santiaguito exhibits pressure fluctuations that vary in periods from tens of seconds to high-frequency oscillations in the 1 Hz band.",
