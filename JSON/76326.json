        "Description/Abstract": "Our team met with the Boise Homeless Coalition\u2019s (BHC) Leader of Outreach, Denise Caruzzi, and identified a current need for information on the topic of housing insecurity among college students in Boise, Idaho. We began the research process by identifying research articles from multiple databases. We found that housing insecure college students tend to struggle academically due to the lack of resources available to them. There is a lack of resources at Boise State University. Casework availability, identification practices, increased funding, regional data sharing, and targeted assistance programs were identified as beneficial to students' success at universities across the United States of America.",
