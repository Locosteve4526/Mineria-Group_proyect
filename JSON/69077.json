        "Description/Abstract": "Valid and reliable measurement of implementation strategies is essential to advancing implementation science; however, this area lags behind the measurement of implementation outcomes and determinants. Clinical supervision is a promising and highly feasible implementation strategy in behavioral healthcare for which pragmatic measures are lacking. This research aimed to develop and psychometrically evaluate a pragmatic measure of clinical supervision conceptualized in terms of two broadly applicable, discrete clinical supervision techniques shown to improve providers' implementation of evidence-based psychosocial interventions-(1) audit and feedback and (2) active learning.",
