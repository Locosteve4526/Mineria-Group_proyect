        "Description/Abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the precision and accuracy of a nonproprietary, optical three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis system for the simultaneous measurement of soft tissue strains and joint kinematics. The system consisted of two high-resolution digital cameras and software for calculating the 3D coordinates of contrast markers. System precision was assessed by examining the variation in the coordinates of static markers over time. Three-dimensional strain measurement accuracy was assessed by moving contrast markers fixed distances in the field of view and calculating the error in predicted strain. Three-dimensional accuracy for kinematic measurements was assessed by simulating the measurements that are required for recording knee kinematics. The field of view (190 mm) was chosen to allow simultaneous recording of markers for soft tissue strain measurement and knee joint kinematics. Average system precision was between +/-0.004 mm and +/-0.035 mm, depending on marker size and camera angle. Absolute error in strain measurement varied from a minimum of +/-0.025% to a maximum of +/-0.142%, depending on the angle between cameras and the direction of strain with respect to the camera axes. Kinematic accuracy for translations was between +/-0.008 mm and +/-0.034 mm, while rotational accuracy was +/-0.082 deg to +/-0.160 deg. These results demonstrate that simultaneous optical measurement of 3D soft tissue strain and 3D joint kinematics can be performed while achieving excellent accuracy for both sets of measurements.",
