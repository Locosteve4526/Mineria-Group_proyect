        "Description/Abstract": "Most states utilize some form of a child risk assessment to assist child protection professionals in determining whether or not abuse has occurred. However, there is disagreement in the field on which model of instrument formulation is most appropriate: actuarial, consensus based or blended; thus, no uniform standards exist. In this qualitative study, concept mapping provided the framework for child protection researchers and professionals to identify items they believed should be included in a child welfare risk assessment. These items were then grouped together under six separate headings, an instrument was generated, and participants were asked to rate each item on its empirical basis and again on its social work values basis. Data were analyzed to determine whether empirical rating and values-based rating differences between items were statistically significant. Sixteen items met this criterion. Potential implications for the field and the need for further research on risk assessments are discussed.",
