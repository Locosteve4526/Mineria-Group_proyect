One must be willing to work hard and make the necessary effort to succeed. This combination of passion and perseverance is known as \u201cgrit\u201d. Those who possess this trait know there are no shortcuts to excellence, however, those who may not be as inclined to this type of commitment can learn it from deliberate practice and through specific strategies instituted by faculty. The speakers will present the relevant literature on this topic and introduce how these strategies can increase student engagement and success, all while cultivating a supportive and inclusive learning environment for all.",
