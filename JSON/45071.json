        "Description/Abstract": "After accepting my essay and waiting for nearly a year, the organizer, co editor rejected it.  It is really unfair, but that is life in academic publishing.\n\nMale Bonding versus Sympathy for Women: \nThe Place of Aslima in Claude McKay\u2019s \u201cRomance in Marseille\u201d\n\n\u201cProstitutes stand not at the periphery of modern society, but at its dead center.  They personify the complex interplay between bright fantasies of solidly established tradition and the dark, sullen acceptance of human ignorance.\u201d (Reid-Pharr 125)\n\nIf Claude McKay\u2019s commitment to homosocial and homosexual bonds between men outweighs his interest in a heterosexual love plot in Banjo, heterosexual romance plots with relatively happy endings do characterize Home to Harlem and Banana Bottom. Similarly, while Jean-Christophe\u2019s dismissal of Seraphine Peixota\u2019s efforts to attract Almaya in Amiable with Big Teeth as \u201cdimwit romance\u201d seems warranted, it is nonetheless true that the romance between Almaya and Gloria Kendall is more than a second-best consolation for the Ethiopian diplomat (Amiable xiv, 247). McKay offers an ironic twist to such plotting in his ending to \u201cRomance in Marseille.\u201d At the same time, the novel offers a surprising glimpse into the inner life of Aslima, the love interest of the protagonist Lafala, when she experiences her vision in Chapter 11 (\u201cRomance\u201d 75-79). It seems essential to the plot that the vision occurs after she leaves her pimp Titin and before she makes her way to see Lafala at his hotel.\nOn the one hand McKay deftly imagines his way in to the experience of others, but on the other he often remains at a deliberate distance from the inner lives of his characters. The speakers of \u201cHarlem Shadows\u201d and \u201cHarlem Dancer\u201d sympathize with prostitutes enough to identify with them and care about their plight in a \u201cstern harsh world\u201d that \u201cHas pushed [their] timid little feet of clay\u201d into poverty (Collected 162).  In \u201cMidnight Woman to the Bobby,\u201d McKay even impersonates a streetwalker who adamantly defends herself against the depredations of a policeman (Collected 51-52).  By contrast, the characters in \u201cRomance in Marseille,\u201d as in Banjo and Home to Harlem, take sex work for granted and the men wage a war between the sexes in order to protect their self-interest. Although Ray shares a moment of unity with Latnah when they smoke opium together in Banjo (282-84), Banjo easily dismisses her at the end of that novel, explicitly preferring the male bonds between himself and Ray. As Michelle Stephens has asked, \u201cWhy is Latnah\u2019s absence necessary to the resolution of the black transnational romance? Why is she forfeited in the masculine quest for racial freedom? (168).\nWhile Aslima\u2019s ultimate abandonment parallels that of Latnah, in \u201cRomance in Marseille\u201d Lafala really does seem to love Aslima and they experience a genuine harmony together for an extended period of time. By contrast, McKay\u2019s treatment of sex work in \u201cThe Beast\u201d (1920) is rendered almost allegorically, in schematic ideological terms:\nDown in its shops and offices and streets\n\tThe toilers struggle, sullen, underpaid,\nAnd pinch-faced poverty proud Plutus meets,\n\tAnd pimps and harlots ply their wretched trade.\nAnd in its gorgeous halls where gold holds sway\n\tThe smirking mother offers her young daughter\nTo haughty men for whom all women are play\n\tOr babes, or ornaments, or sheep for slaughter:\nIts system makes men parasites or brutes\nAnd tends to make all women prostitutes. (Collected 133)\nIn \u201cRomance,\u201d McKay  individuates Aslima so that she stands out of the mass of \u201charlots\u201d in Marseille. The inevitability of the bond between \u201cbrutes\u201d and \u201cprostitutes\u201d in \u201cThe Beast\u201d is not as evident in \u201cRomance\u201d until the final scene of the novel. Nonetheless, Lafala\u2019s final decision to abandon her keeps his autonomy intact by surrendering Aslima to what turns out to be a violent end at the hands of her white pimp. It is unclear if the novel\u2019s outcome proves the truth of Aslima\u2019s vision, given the centrality of the flaming sword in it (\u201cRomance\u201d 75-77). While the vision identifies the sword with life, it is also an instrument of death and division. In addition, it parallels Latnah\u2019s dagger in Banjo. In a suicidal gesture, moreover, Aslima herself pulls a knife on Titin at the end of Romance, which drives him to shoot her to death. Wayne Cooper writes that Aslima \u201cannihilates\u201d Lafala at the end of the story.  He is presumably referring to an earlier draft of the manuscript, so it seems significant that Lafala abandons her and Titin kills her in the last version of McKay\u2019s novel (267).\nThe relatively sympathetic treatment of Aslima is remarkably different from the more generally negative depictions of women in Home to Harlem and Banjo, although it is nowhere near the fully sympathetic rendering of Bita Plant in Banana Bottom.  McKay makes Bita the star of her story: she enjoys the same narrative spotlight as Jake in Home and Lincoln Agrippa Daily in Banjo. But she is not a prostitute. The irony of \u201cRomance\u201d distills the harsh realism of the first two novels, but it also reflects greater sympathy with at least one woman. If the sympathy for prostitutes in the poems is often romanticized and the figurations of Latnah and Aslima decidedly Orientalized, it is nonetheless true that McKay offers compelling portraits of women in Banana Bottom and \u201cRomance in Marseille.\u201d\nIn an article addressing Banjo, Leah Rosenberg argues that \u201cMcKay sets the primitive in almost binary opposition to prostitution\u201d (225). From another standpoint, Smita Das focuses on mixed-race women in Banjo and Banana Bottom, concluding that \u201cFor McKay, the Afro-Asian body functions as a site of a struggle that needs to be accounted for in transnational and national contexts\u201d (721). In \u201cRomance in Marseille,\u201d Lafala and Aslima seem to embrace their primal instincts through the pig discourse they employ to characterize their sexual interactions, which might suggest a provisional resolution to the conflicts identified by Rosenberg and Das. (Not incidentally, Aslima\u2019s exuberant pig discourse and pig dance at Tout-va-Bien repudiate religious and social attitudes toward swine as ritually unclean, taboo animals [\u201cRomance\u201d 47-48].) However, since Lafala is fully African and Aslima is another example of the \u201cAfro-Asian\u201d female body, the final outcome of \u201cRomance\u201d seems to conform to the symbolic pattern of struggle Das sees at work in Banjo and Banana Bottom. Because of uncertainty about her true motivations and allegiance, Aslima apparently both mediates Lafala\u2019s return home and provides a barrier to his return.  As a fellow African, she shares an ancestral heritage with him, but as part Arab and female sex worker, she poses a threat to Lafala, at least in the eyes of his male companions. According to Gary Holcomb, when Lafala accepts the view of other men and decides to abandon Aslima, he fails to understand love, whereas Aslima takes on the operatic grandeur of a tragic heroine when Titin kills her (222). \nFor Holcomb, Aslima ultimately emerges as the protagonist; the novel \u201cis more her legend than anyone else\u2019s\u201d (224). This may feel true to many readers of the novel\u2014and in a letter of March 1930 McKay himself confessed to feeling that Aslima was \u201crunning away with the book and me\u201d (Cooper 267). In the cultural logics of Rosenberg and Das, however, McKay\u2019s decision to end his story with a solitary Lafala returning to his home in Africa seems to reaffirm the conflicts between prostitute and primitive on the one hand and African and mixed-race Asian-African on the other.  According to those cultural logics, Aslima\u2019s personal heroism would seem to be unavailing. At the same time, by providing such rich contexts for Aslima\u2019s part in Lafala\u2019s story, McKay makes his readers feel the sting of Lafala\u2019s abandonment and the shock of her brutally violent death.\nSince Aslima is depicted as an embodiment of Africa in Lafala\u2019s imagination (\u201cRomance\u201d 5), the fact that he separates himself from her is contradictory. For this reason it is surprising that he abandons her in the end. Since he planned to take her with him up until the night before his departure, his volte-face seems unaccountable, or at least precipitous. However, in light of the ending of Banjo and the privileging of male bonds over heterosexual ones in Banjo and even in Home to Harlem, the end may seem less surprising. \u201cRomance in Marseille\u201d fits in with Das\u2019s view of Banjo. But it would also seem to belie the dramatic vision experienced by Aslima and the enduring love shared by her and Lafala until his departure. This gives the novel an unsettling, even unfinished quality. But the abrupt change of plans on Lafala\u2019s part is treated with great drama from Aslima\u2019s perspective, if not Lafala\u2019s. In \u201cRomance,\u201d McKay offers a complex picture of black transnationalism and gender relations. Perhaps one of the strengths of the novel is that it does not resolve the conflicts associated with either.\u2003\n\nWorks Cited\nCooper, Wayne.
