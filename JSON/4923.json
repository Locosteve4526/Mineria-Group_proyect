        "Description/Abstract": "In 1989 the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Idaho Army National Guard (lDARNG) entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) committing the parties to monitor archaeological sites in the Orchard Training Area (OTA) south of Boise. The agreement was based upon an earlier archaeological reconnaissance (see Addington 1987) which identified 70 cultural resource sites. Since 1989, the BLM has monitored the 28 sign ificant sites as identified in the 1989 MOA with the Idaho Army National Guard. During the fall of 1993, the Idaho Army National Guard, Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Anthropology, Boise State University (B SU), initiated discussion regarding BSU's cooperation in monitoring the cultural resource sites in the OTA. These discussions led to a draft of an amendment to the MOA which includes Boise State University as a partner with BLM and IDARNG. The inclusion of BSU in the cooperative agreement will increase protection for the historic properties and facilitate the educational programs at Boise State University.",
