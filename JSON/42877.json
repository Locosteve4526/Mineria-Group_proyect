        "Description/Abstract": "Writing assessment research has long described the harmful effects of using standardized test scores for writing placement. Now, national higher education reform efforts are critiquing the use of these tests as well. In this article, we explore how external pressures in higher education offer new spaces for WPAs to advocate for richer placement processes. We propose that placement is a moment where faculty can and should shape the conversation in order to help others \u2013 policy makers, non-profit agencies involved in remediation reform \u2013 see placement anew. Finally, we describe our own locally-developed writing placement process as one possible placement approach that encourages student reflection and draws on faculty expertise.\n",
