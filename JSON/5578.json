        "Description/Abstract": "Background: The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of a 12-week Fit and Fall Proof \u2122exercise program (45 minutes; two days per week) for older adults on physical activity levels. \nMethod: Forty-nine community dwelling older adult volunteers, aged 64-95 (M=77.29 \u00b17.60), participated in the study. Baseline and ending PASE (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly) scores were used to determine physical activity levels for the exercise (n=34) and control (n=15) groups. \nResults: One way ANOVA results reported no significant PASE score differences at baseline between the exercise (103.65 \u00b157.89) and control (113.74 \u00b158.30) groups. At the completion of the 12-week exercise program, no significant differences were found with the PASE scores between the exercise group (97.82 \u00b158.03) and control (91.20 \u00b151.76). Paired T-test analyses within each group demonstrated that the exercise group significantly increased PASE activities involving muscular strength and endurance (pre: 3.13 \u00b16.16; post:10.52 \u00b112.82) and decreased engagement in outdoor gardening (pre: 7.06 \u00b19.70; post: 2.94 \u00b17.19) by the end of the intervention. The control group reported a significantly lower final PASE score compared to baseline results. No significant correlations were reported between PASE scores and height, weight, BMI, modified Berg Balance Scale, timed 8-foot up-and-go, 30 second chair stand, and arm curl (p &gt; 0.05). \nConclusions: While the 12-week exercise program did not result in significantly higher levels of physical activity with the older adult exercise group, the program helped maintain a level of physical activity that was not found with participants in the control group.\n",
