        "Description/Abstract": "Bar-Natan skein modules have been introduced by Bar-Natan\n in his approach to Khovanov homology. In his case these are\n quotients of abelian groups generated by surfaces,\n with components possibly carrying dots, by a set of certain\n surgery induced relations. These modules have been generalized\n by Asaeda and Frohman to a setting of dotted surfaces embedded\n in compact 3-manifolds. I will  discuss a general definition\n of Bar-Natan modules for surfaces embedded in compact\n 3-manifolds, with the components colored by elements\n of an arbitrary commutative Frobenius algebra (with the dot\n case corresponding to x in Z[x]/(x^2)). This construction\n defines in fact a full extension of the 2-dimensional TQFT\n corresponding to the Frobenius algebra. Then I will show that\n each commutative Frobenius algebra defines a natural category\n of algebras. Moreover, for each compact 3-manifold with\n a closed 1-manifold in its boundary, there is a compression\n body category defined by Casson and Gordon. We will define\n a functor from the compression body category into this\n category of algebras, such that the colimit of this functor is\n the Bar-Natan module. This new type of categorification leads\n to a good understanding of how the topology of the 3-manifold\n is reflected in the modules and to presentations in terms\n of incompressible surfaces (in the dotted case already\n observed by Asaeda and Frohman). There is a bicategory version\n of this result, an orientable and an oriented version, and\n functors relating these structures. If time permits I will\n also discuss the definition and some results and questions\n for a skein module combining Bar-Natan skein modules with the\n Kauffman bracket skein module.",
