        "Description/Abstract": "Industrial buyer-supplier relationships are conditioned by interactions between the two parties.  These interactions include the processes and recurring rounds of negotiations. The purpose of this paper is to study the variables that are likely to influence the outcome of a two-party negotiation in an experiment that reproduces some of the richness encountered in real-life negotiations. A two-party negotiation experiment was conducted on university students. Specifically, we analyze the effect of reservation prices, aspiration prices, and competitive stances on the outcome of a two-party negotiation.",
