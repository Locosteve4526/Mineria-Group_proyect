        "Description/Abstract": "The global U.S. military network is an unparalleled security arrangement that has allowed the United States to project military force in every geopolitical region. By stationing its troops abroad, the United States has effectively outsourced many of the inevitable environmental consequences of its unique military position. Activists have noticed this particular consequence of basing and have mobilized against it in several countries. Our study takes a multimethod approach to assess the effect of these movements. To assess whether protests have been effective in changing the deployments by the United States, we employ a textual review of available Status of Forces Agreements, a case study of the protest movements in Vieques and Okinawa, and a large observational study of the effect of protests on the concentration of U.S. forces in other countries. While there has been some success in local movements, the overall effect of protests has been minimal thus far.",
