        "Description/Abstract": "Diagrammatic reducibility DR and its generalization vertex asphericity VA are\ncombinatorial tools developed for detecting asphericity of a 2-complex. Here we\npresent tests for a relative version of VA that apply to pairs of 2-complexes\n$(L,K)$, where $K$ is a subcomplex of $L$. We show that a relative weight test\nholds for injective labeled oriented trees, implying that they are VA and hence\naspherical. This strengthens a result obtained by the authors in 2017 and\nsimplifies the original proof.\n[Journal_ref: ]",
