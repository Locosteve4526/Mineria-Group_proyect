        "Description/Abstract": "We tested an algorithm-based assessment tool for measuring vasomotor responses generated with a photoelectric plethysmograph in a mock crime laboratory experiment. Ten students completing their basic polygraph training participated in the study as examiners and as test subjects. Forty examinations were conducted and analyzed. Empirical Scoring System (ESS, Nelson et al., 2011) scores for the vasomotor response significantly predicted guilt and innocence and were more strongly correlated with the Guilt Criterion than were blood pressure and respiration. Discriminant analysis of our data produced a three-variable solution ordering the predictors (strongest first), electrodermal, vasomotor, and blood pressure. Respiration did not contribute significantly to the solution and was not included in the model. On N - 1 cross validation, our discriminant analysis model correctly classified 92.5% of the examinations. These results are consistent with a large body of research that shows the vasomotor response to be a valuable contribution to physiological deception detection. Examiners are urged to adopt its use.\n\nThis is a Spanish language republication of Honts et al., (2015)",
