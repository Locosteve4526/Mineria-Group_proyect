        "Description/Abstract": "Opponents of the neoliberal privatization of schools must be cautious in formulating their opposition so as not to situate themselves as the defenders of an otherwise indefensible status quo. Though we might expect professors in traditional university-based educational-leadership programs to protect their institutional self-interests and their traditional monopoly on the preparation of school leaders against the challenge presented by Eli Broad\u2019s Superintendents Academy, do we know for a fact that the curriculum of Broad\u2019s Academy differs significantly from their own programs? It would be hard for us to name very many professors who have defended those programs as bastions of democratic values.",
