        "Description/Abstract": "Despite the fact that harboring the apolipoprotein E4 () allele represents the single greatest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), the exact mechanism by which apoE4 contributes to disease progression remains unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that a 151 amino-terminal fragment of apoE4 (nApoE4) localizes within the nucleus of microglia in the human AD brain, suggesting a potential role in gene expression. In the present study, we investigated this possibility utilizing BV2 microglia cells treated exogenously with nApoE4. The results indicated that nApoE4 leads to morphological activation of microglia cells through, at least in part, the downregulation of a novel ER-associated protein, CXorf56. Moreover, treatment of BV2 cells with nApoE4 resulted in a 68-fold increase in the expression of the inflammatory cytokine, TNF, a key trigger of microglia activation. In this regard, we also observed a specific binding interaction of nApoE4 with the TNF promoter region. Collectively, these data identify a novel gene-regulatory pathway involving CXorf56 that may link apoE4 to microglia activation and inflammation associated with AD.",
