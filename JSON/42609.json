        "Description/Abstract": "The event of learning is the Achilles heel of the \u201cdiscourses\u201d or \u201clanguage[s] of learning\u201d dominant in education today (Meyer-Drawe 2008; Biesta 2012). We have almost no empirical access to or control over this event. It can\u2019t be caused or guaranteed, and its occurrence is visible (if at all) only post facto. For phenomenology, however, learning-as-experience forms a key moment in lived experience (Erlebnis). It appears as something that occurs and can be fostered through the variation of possible experience familiar to phenomenology in the form of the reduction. In describing learning-as-experience, this paper sheds new light on contemporary discourses of learning\u2014from the intricacies of the learning sciences to the effortful learning advocated by the growth mindset.
