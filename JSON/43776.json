        "Description/Abstract": "Anthracyclines are a class of effective chemotherapy drugs.  A major limitation to the use of anthracyclines is the risk of chronic cardiotoxicity that is assocd. with its use.  The cardiotoxicity is linked to the NADPH-\u200bdependent redn. of anthracyclines by Human Carbonyl Reductase I (HCBR1)\u200b.  The creation of an anthracycline that is not reduced by HCBR1 has the potential to lower the risk of anthracycline-\u200bassocd. cardiotoxicity.  Mol. modeling with doxorubicin and daunorubicin suggests that Met234 may play a significant role in directing the substrate specificity, favoring daunorubicin over doxorubicin.  To investigate the role of Met234 in substrate specificity.  Met234 was substituted with alanine.  The catalytic efficiencies with several carbonyl substrates for the Met234Ala enzyme are 2\u200b%-\u200b4\u200b% of that for the native enzyme.  NADPH binding affinity for the Met234Ala enzyme is 15\u200b% of what for the native enzyme.  A structural modeling study of HCBR1 suggests that Met234 interacts with NADPH and therefore the mutation to alanine allows for an altered binding orientation that in turn may also account for the obsd. redn. in carbonyl substrate specificities.\n\n",
