        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Most studies on technology integration in mathematics education are focused on teachers\u2019 perceptions or students\u2019 academic achievement. However, it is necessary to learn how students perceive their learning in this environment. This basic qualitative study focuses on students\u2019 experiences with 1:1 computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) in an Algebraic Reasoning classroom. One hundred high school students were invited to participate in this study, nine primarily male students volunteered to share their experiences. We found that students perceived the environment to (1) be user-friendly, (2) provide a enjoyable experience, (3) support their learning, (4) provide multiple ways to learn, (5) allow them to \u201csee\u201d the concepts, (6) make previous interactions accessible, and (7) provide passive feedback&lt;/p&gt;",
