        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Stress and depression negatively impact nursing students. The rate of depression in undergraduate nursing students is approximately 20%- 34%. Mindfulness has been shown to improve mental health in a variety of populations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: This quasi experimental pretest-posttest study included 26 prelicensure nursing students from a public university in the Pacific Northwest, US. Students used a mindfulness application (app), Smiling Mind, for six weeks. Stress (PSS), depression (BDI) and self compassion (SCS) were measured.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: There was a statistically significant reduction in stress, depression, and an increase in total self compassion.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/em&gt;It is well documented that nursing students experience stress and depression and the need for simple and cost-effective interventions to support students\u2019 mental health. Using a mindfulness mobile app is promising to improve the mental health of students. Our study showed that minimal app usage resulted in significant positive effects. It is a simple, easy, and cost effective intervention that students can use for mental health wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;",
