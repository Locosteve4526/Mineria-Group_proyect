        "Description/Abstract": "Modern philosophers have defined Christianity down, in an effort to reconcile it with democracy.  But they still somehow want to preserve its salutary influence on public opinion and culture.  Ultimately, the democratic movement erases the Christian ideas of sin and two kingdoms in favor of an unhealthy vision of human perfectibility.  ",
