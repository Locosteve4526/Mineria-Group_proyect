        "Description/Abstract": "The profession of social work advocates for civil rights for gay men, lesbians, and\r\nbisexual persons. However, a number of social work students and practitioners harbor antigay bias that\r\nin prior variable-centered research has been determined to be related to race, relationship status, and\r\nage. The purpose of this research was to use latent class analysis (LCA), a person-centered statistical\r\ntechnique, to cluster 394 university student survey responses to the Attitudes Toward Lesbian and Gays\r\nshort-form instrument. The analyses indicated three groups that can be profiled as unbiased, moderately\r\nbiased, and highly biased. Analysis of variance and multinomial regression verified LCA findings that\r\nare consistent with prior research. The importance of selecting appropriate educational approaches\r\nto address antigay bias among social work students and practicing social workers is discussed, and\r\nrecommendations for continued research, including a national random survey of social work students\r\nand licensed social workers, are made.",
