        "Description/Abstract": "Smaller cities such as Boise, Idaho wishing to reap the benefits of clusters need to play to their strengths, and creating an urban ecosystem conductive to fun informal social interaction may be one under-explored area of competitive advantage. In this paper, I outline a theory of why bigger is not better, and why informal ties through leisure-based activities such as skiing can attract and retain great people forming the basis for knowledge-intensive cluster formation. This can lead to increased knowledge spillovers in the formal economy and hence drive increased success in economic clusters outside the major Global Cities.  ",
