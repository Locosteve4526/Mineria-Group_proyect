Or you may feel you need to focus on pronunciation and grammar before you actually move on to career skills?\u00a0 Presenters will share ideas on how to improve students\u2019 diction and pronunciation while developing simultaneous and consecutive interpretation skills for an exciting future career as a medical or court interpreter. Attendees will engage in interactive exercises to test drive them before taking them into the classroom and locate existing Open Educational Resources interpretation activities that they can use the following day in their language classrooms. &lt;/span&gt;",
