        "Description/Abstract": "The objectivity of forensic science decision making has received  increased attention and scrutiny. However, there are only a few  published studies experimentally addressing the potential for contextual  bias. Because of the esteem of DNA evidence, it is important to study  and assess the impact of subjectivity and bias on DNA mixture  interpretation. The study reported here presents empirical data  suggesting that DNA mixture interpretation is subjective. When 17 North  American expert DNA examiners were asked for their interpretation of  data from an adjudicated criminal case in that jurisdiction, they  produced inconsistent interpretations. Furthermore, the majority of  'context free' experts disagreed with the laboratory's pre-trial  conclusions, suggesting that the extraneous context of the criminal case  may have influenced the interpretation of the DNA evidence, thereby  showing a biasing effect of contextual information in DNA mixture  interpretation.",
