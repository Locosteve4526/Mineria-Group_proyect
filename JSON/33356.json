        "Description/Abstract": "This presentation endeavors to do three things.  First, I aim to systematically characterize the alt-right \u201cmovement\u201d and its core principles, using journalistic coverage and alt-right leaders\u2019 own words to do so.  Second, I examine the rhetoric of the alt-right publication Radix Journal, paying particular attention to the rhetoric of domination articulated there.  I argue that this rhetoric is spilling over into many mainstream public policy debates, or is making explicit and acceptable radical conservative views that were already there.  Third, I look at how the goals and values of radical conservatism may be informing rhetoric about mainstream energy policy\u2014and in particular the emergence of the concept of \u201cenergy dominance\u201d\u2014and contrast these policies with the goals and values of energy democracy.   I conclude with a few words emphasizing how this analysis underscores the importance of an intersectional energy democracy that counters white nationalist, misogynist, and anti-justice viewpoints that are increasingly moving into the mainstream.",
