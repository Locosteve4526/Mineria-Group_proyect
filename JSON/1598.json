        "Description/Abstract": "The acid rain issue came into prominence because scientists kept telling the world of acid rain's potential devastating effects. Yet, the acid rain debate was marked by mistrust between American and Canadian scientists.  The signing of the Air Quality Accord in 1991 appears to have quelled this divisiveness and promises to bring about a new era of scientific cooperation.  Using surveys of acid rain scientists in the United States and Canada across three time periods, this study finds both similarities and differences between how Canadian and American scientists view many of the issues surrounding the acid rain debate.",
