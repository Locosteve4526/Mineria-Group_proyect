        "Description/Abstract": "This paper asks if we can understand the subaltern act in relation to Lacan\u2019s theory of acts ? Drawing on textual moments from Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s short story \u201cJibito O Mrito\u201d (\u201cAlive and Dead\u201d [1892]), Gilles Pontecorvo\u2019s 1969 film Quiemada (Burn!), Freud\u2019s case study of the female homosexual (1920), and a short Indo-French documentary made in the 1970\u2019s on the Sentinelese people of the Andaman Islands, I ask two interrelated questions. First, how can we read the subaltern act via Lacan, and, second, what are the radical implications of a violent subaltern acting out compared to the subaltern\u2019s passage into death.\n ",
