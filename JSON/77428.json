        "Description/Abstract": "Library professional literature has a major problem - you aren\u2019t writing it! Authorship studies show that many library employee voices are under- or unrepresented across library journals and magazines. In this session we will call out the problem, briefly discuss some of the root causes, and then get to work on practical solutions. This session is intended for all library workers regardless of rank or title. Bring your pencil (or laptop) and your ideas as we will have plenty of time for brainstorming, workshopping, identifying potential collaborators, and finding outlets for publication.",
