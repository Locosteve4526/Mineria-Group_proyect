        "Description/Abstract": "Theory and correlational research indicate organizational leadership and climate are important for successful implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in healthcare settings; however, experimental evidence is lacking. We addressed this gap using data from the WISDOM (Working to Implement and Sustain Digital Outcome Measures) hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation trial. Primary outcomes from WISDOM indicated the Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) strategy improved fidelity to measurement-based care (MBC) in youth mental health services. In this study, we tested LOCI's hypothesized mechanisms of change, namely: (1) LOCI will improve implementation and transformational leadership, which in turn will (2) mediate LOCI's effect on implementation climate, which in turn will (3) mediate LOCI's effect on MBC fidelity.",
