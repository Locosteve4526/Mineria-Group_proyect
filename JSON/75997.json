        "Description/Abstract": "T&lt;br&gt;his year\u2019s storytelling evening\u2019s conversation and panel will focus on the importance of both private&lt;br&gt;and public lands, the critical role of agriculture in conservation and obstacles that landowners face&lt;br&gt;in stewarding these landscapes. Panelists will dive into the world of innovative tools and practices&lt;br&gt;being used by landowners and producers to benefit the habitat they steward and the humans and wildlife&lt;br&gt;that depend on it. The panel will also highlight the idea of stewardship beyond boundaries: the need for&lt;br&gt;all of us - landowners, sportsmen, recreationalists, ranchers, rural and urban residents - to look beyond the&lt;br&gt;boundaries of our land or immediate self-interests. The future of the West is dependent on building healthy&lt;br&gt;landscapes that work for us all.",
