However, for service learning to be impactful, students must take advantage of service learning opportunities that are created for them.\u00a0 This paper explores barriers to students enrolling in service learning, such as limited time, financial constraints, disinterest and so on, when enrollment is soptional.\u00a0 Analysis is based on a survey (n=42) of students who chose not to enroll in an optional service learning lab offered as part of a supply chain management course in a metropolitan university in the US.\u00a0 The findings reveal that time is the most important barrier.\u00a0 Based on the findings, we make a number of recommendations for overcoming this and other barriers.\u00a0\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
