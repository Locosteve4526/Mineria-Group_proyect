        "Description/Abstract": "Organizations increasingly use Agile development and project management to create their performance solutions. These Agile approaches rely on iterations of work that successively refine a product. Agile can lend itself to the Spiral Human Performance Improvement (HPI) framework, which attempts to capture what is happening in savvy practitioners\u2019 heads as they move through the performance improvement process in a messy and chaotic real world. Using this framework, HPI practitioners make valued contributions to Agile efforts.",
