        "Description/Abstract": "One of Germany\u2019s most prolific and acclaimed younger writers, Antje R\u00e1vic Strubel\u2019s novels explore ideas about post-Wende identity and agency, from the legacy of the Stasi to the social challenges posed by incestuous or homosexual relationships. Meanwhile, her two non-fiction \u201cUser Manuals\u201d to Sweden and Potsdam/Brandenburg offer affectionate yet critical insights to her Scandinavian \u201cSehnsuchtsland\u201d (land of longing), and her place of birth and current residence, respectively. Strubel\u2019s many prizes and achievements include the Klagenfurt Ernst Willner Prize, received for her debut novel Offene Blende in 2001, and a recent long-listing for the German Book Prize for her latest novel, Sturz der Tage in die Nacht (2011), described by the ARD network\u2019s Denis Scheck as \u201cthe best German novel of the year.\u201d\nExplanation of Other:  Interview",
