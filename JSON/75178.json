        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Nursing education must promote and foster affective and cognitive empathy competencies in students, enhancing understanding of others' emotions and perspectives. Empathy is crucial for person-centered care and relational nursing practice, aligning with educational standards. Shared decision-making (SDM) has been increasingly integrated into our healthcare system. It requires empathy for successful collaboration to ensure that person-centered care is at the core of healthcare decision-making. This research utilized a quantitative approach with a convenience sample to investigate the effectiveness of a virtual synchronous role-play simulation in developing empathy among junior-level baccalaureate nursing students. The Comprehensive State Empathy Scale (CSES) measured students' empathy levels after participating in the role-play simulation. Findings suggest that the simulation effectively enhanced the affective and cognitive empathy experience. Students reported experiencing compassionate, sympathetic, and tender feelings. They also demonstrated a strong urge to help the patient, focus on the patient's emotions and perspectives, and imagine themselves in the patient\u2019s situation. This research supports the incorporation of virtual synchronous role-play simulations involving SDM, which can be transformative and enhance the development of empathy competency in nursing students, preparing them for future challenges in patient care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;",
