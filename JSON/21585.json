        "Description/Abstract": "Our goal is to design and demonstrate a new set of techniques that help NSF to broaden participation in STEM fields and educate a STEM-literate populace. Our proposed project, Sci-Fi TIES: Using Science Fiction to Improve Undergraduate Students\u2019 Scientific Thought, Innovation, Ethics, &amp; Self-Perception, is a research-based and research-generating transdisciplinary effort among faculty from five different disciplines to test effective means for engaging students in science and scientific thinking, addressing both the cognitive and affective domains as called for by the National Research Council. \n\nSci-Fi TIES will generate transferable, evidence-based instructional strategies that cater both to affective and cognitive aspects of STEM undergraduate education in order to: (1) increase student interest and retention in STEM fields; (2) broaden student participation in STEM fields; (3) prepare leaders, teachers, and innovators for the workforce; (4) improve students' STEM learning outcomes; (5) disseminate results and identified best practices; and (6) contribute to undergraduate curricular change.\nRole:  Co-Principal",
