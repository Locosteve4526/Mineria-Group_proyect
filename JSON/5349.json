        "Description/Abstract": "Arhangel'skii proved that if a first countable Hausdorff space is Lindel\u00f6f, then its cardinality is at most 2 ??0. Such a clean upper bound for Lindel\u00f6f spaces in the larger class of spaces whose points are G? has been more elusive. In this paper we continue the agenda started by the second author, [Topology Appl. 63 (1995)], of considering the cardinality problem for spaces satisfying stronger versions of the Lindel\u00f6f property. Infinite games and selection principles, especially the Rothberger property, are essential tools in our investigations.",
