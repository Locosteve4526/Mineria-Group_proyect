        "Description/Abstract": "Corporate sustainability reporting has increased significantly over the past decade.  Recognizing this trend, the EU passed the EU Modernisation Directive, which amended existing EU law to require reporting of non-financial information.  This paper investigates the impact of the Modernisation Directive through the legal concept of harmonisation, i.e., the development of common standards to make possible the EU internal market.  Excessive harmonisation stifles regulatory competition, while insufficient harmonisation undermines the purposes of EU-wide regulation.  This research looks for the effects of the Modernisation Directive and its goal of harmonized reporting laws by examining EU member states\u2019 laws and European company reports.",
