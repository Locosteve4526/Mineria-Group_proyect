While many ideas were novel, other innovations were the result of incremental improvements on existing technoloies.  The adoption and diffusion of innovations require the availability of relevant knowledge, competent people, and the availablility of financial support. Organizations with formal R&amp;D programs have been most successful in creating such innovations and subsequent adoption and application. An example of such an innovation is the development of a novel robotically controlled thermal maniking laboratry which combines a pneumotechnology with the Internet thus making the system accessible to researchers globally.\r\n",
