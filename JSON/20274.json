        "Description/Abstract": "This paper is a continuation of research within the electronics industry that exams the role of the purchasing function. Four factors were identified through factor analysis from twenty-four purchasing activities crucial to firm performance. These activities were identified in previous research. From the four factors, cluster analysis was utilized and identified five clusters. These clusters identified a topology of different approaches firms take with respect to identifying purchasing strategic focus and scope of responsibilities. The five clusters are: Delivery Boys, Clerks, Strategist, Planners and Integrator. A multivariate analysis indicated that \u201cDelivery Boys\u201d have lower performance with respect to Gross Profit Margin than the other four clusters. ",
