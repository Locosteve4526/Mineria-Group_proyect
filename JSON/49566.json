        "Description/Abstract": "Thirty years after mandatory arrest in domestic violence incidents swept policing, questions still remain about the effects of gender stereotypes and myths on police decision-making. Mandatory or even preferred arrest policies do not \u201ckick in\u201d until officers determine that probable cause exists, thus retaining much of officers\u2019 discretionary authority in responding to these cases (e.g., assessing victim and suspect credibility). Discretionary decision-making is also present in the determinations of dual arrests, requesting warrants when the suspect has left the scene, conducting follow-up evidence collection, connecting victims to appropriate services, and case referral for charging. The current study reviewed a sample of domestic violence police reports from 2016-2017 from a northwestern police department to measure potential gender bias in officers\u2019 response. Results will be discussed in terms of their potential impact on policies and practices for police departments as well as future areas of research.",
