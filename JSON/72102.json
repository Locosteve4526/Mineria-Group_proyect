        "Description/Abstract": "We test an outcome-focused model of entrepreneurial intentions that shows autonomy is an important motivating outcome to entrepreneurial behavior in addition to the outcomes that extant literature already focuses on, namely profit, social impact, and innovation. Our paper is consistent with psychological reactance theory and identifies content creation as an avenue people pursue to reduce psychological reactance associated with low levels of autonomy. A conjoint analysis study of 405 individuals reveals that not only is autonomy a distinct entrepreneurial outcome that drives intent, but autonomy is the second most important outcome. Autonomy is a particularly motivating outcome to young people, aspiring content creators, and holistic thinkers. Holistic thinkers, in terms of viewing the future world as unpredictable, also are more motivated to pursue opportunities that have social impact compared to analytic thinkers who tend to expect stability over time.",
