        "Description/Abstract": "Research-based guidelines for learning variation exist (e.g., Franklin et al., 2007; Garfield, delMas, &amp; Chance, 2007), but little is known about how teachers plan to teach standard deviation, or how these plans align with recent recommendations. In this article, we survey lesson plans designed by inservice and preservice secondary mathematical teachers. We report on the accuracy, technology usage, and visual representations in the lesson plans. We consider how many elements are used, the level of conceptual development, and the mathematical nature. Findings support differences between preservice and master\u2019s level students in education, as well as a tendency by in-service teachers to teach in alignment with prior learning experiences, despite professional development. Implications for teacher education and curricular development are offered.",
