        "Description/Abstract": "Detecting deception is a complicated endeavor. Previous attempts at deception detection in computer-mediated communication have met with some success. This study shows how speech act profiling can be used to aid decep- tion detection in synchronous computer-mediated communication (S-CMC). Chat logs from an online group game where deception was introduced were sub- jected to speech act profiling analysis. The results provide some support to pre- vious research showing greater uncertainty in deceptive S-CMC. Also shown is that deceivers in the specific task tend to engage in less strategizing than non- deceivers.",
