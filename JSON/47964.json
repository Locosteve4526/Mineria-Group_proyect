        "Description/Abstract": "Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has been used for a number of years as a technique for the improvement of various geological materials. MICP has been used in a limited capacity in organic matter-rich soils with varying degrees of success. Investigators hypothesized that microbially-induced cementation of organic soil could be improved using a surfactant. Varying amounts of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) were added to soils of varying organic content and a mixing procedure was used to treat these soils via MICP. Treated specimens were tested for unconfined compressive strength (UCS). Results appeared to show direct relationships between SDS content and treated specimen strength although significant variability was present in the data. The addition of SDS during MICP treatment improves the organic soil strength, which is likely due to the formation of a calcium dodecyl sulfate complex and little to do with the microbially-induced calcite.",
