        "Description/Abstract": "The path towards the long-term prosperity of our species passes through the sustain-&lt;br&gt;ability of urban environments. A transition to sustainability has to take place within&lt;br&gt;socioecological complex adaptive systems. Thus, urban sustainability processes in the&lt;br&gt;21st century require that we seriously consider the relevance of a complex adaptive sys-&lt;br&gt;tems approach. This paper offers a new roadmap for urban sustainability governance&lt;br&gt;practitioners. Firstly, we attempt to clarify how complexity science can have practical&lt;br&gt;relevance sustainability policies through our understanding of emergent phenomena and&lt;br&gt;employ a small-N comparative analysis of case studies. Secondly, we discuss various&lt;br&gt;challenges that complexity places on practice, focusing on the concepts of predictive ca-&lt;br&gt;pacity, causal explanation, the unconscious mind and the erosion of moral sentiments;&lt;br&gt;we synthesize these ideas by provide a set of guidelines for a sophisticated practitioner.",
