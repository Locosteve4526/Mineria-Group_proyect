        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;OCLC\u2019s new Choreo Insights analytics tool puts a wealth of data into the hands of acquisitions and collections departments. It is also intuitive enough to be used by library employees who may be stakeholders in collections, but have limited collection responsibilities.\u00a0 However, while accessing the data can be relatively easy, knowing what to do with it can prove significantly more challenging. This session provides use case examples from a public R2 library utilizing Choreo Insights and institutional enrollment and graduation data to 1) identify collection gaps, 2) develop library appropriate comparator lists that may differ from official institutional peers, and 3) reintegrate liaison librarians into the collection development process. We will address the value of available canned reports from OCLC and the importance of situating this work as part of larger library conversations about collection development policies and goals. Attendees currently using Choreo Insights will have the opportunity to share their own experiences while those considering a subscription will have the chance to speak with early adopters about successes and challenges.&lt;/span&gt;",
