        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this protocol is to document the steps used for determination of UV doses for polychromatic UV sources such as UV LEDs, excimer lamps, medium pressure mercury lamps. The method is not limited to polychromatic light sources, but can also be used for monochromatic sources, such as low pressure mercury lamps. The method described in this protocol has been modified to account for polychromatic UV radiation sources (Linden and Darby, 1997) and is based on method is based on &quot;Standardization of Methods for Fluence (UV Dose) Determination in Bench-Scale UV Experiments&quot; (Bolton and Linden, 2003). If you cite your use of this protocol, you should also cite the relevant original literature. For further information on using UV LEDs and measuring UV intensity, refer to the following publications: Kheyrandish et al., (2018), Kheyrandish et al., (2017), Kheyrandish et al., (2018), Sholtes et al., (2019).",
