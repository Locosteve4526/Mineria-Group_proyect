        "Description/Abstract": "This paper examines whether auditor\u2019s prior pecuniary outcomes from shirking affect their judgment of whether shirking is unethical. Subsequent to their participation in an experimental audit market, we elicit participant\u2019s judgments as to the degree that shirking during the performance of an audit is unethical. We find that pecuniary benefits associated with having not been caught shirking decrease moral judgments. The results suggest that pecuniary benefits associated with shirking help generate a moral frame by pitting economic self-interest against common social norms. Consistent with cognitive dissonance theory; this conflict also motivates individuals to rationalize their behavior in a self-serving manner. In contrast, pecuniary costs associated with having been caught shirking do not influence moral judgments.   \r\nRole:  Supporting",
