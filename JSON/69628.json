        "Description/Abstract": "Schleiermacher is of the conviction\u2014however unusual it sounds today\u2014that education&lt;br&gt;is not a matter primarily for logical analysis, normative judgment or even for empirical&lt;br&gt;investigation. Education as a discipline, according to Schleiermacher, does not answer&lt;br&gt;primarily to rules of logic, to fixed norms and values, or to matters of empirical fact.&lt;br&gt;Education, in other words, is adequately addressed neither through normativizing critical&lt;br&gt;analysis, nor through empirical investigation and assessment\u2014 arguably the two&lt;br&gt;dominant discourses in educational research today. Education for Schleiermacher, as&lt;br&gt;Schmied- Kowarzik (2008) writes, \u201cis neither a normative nor an empirical discipline,&lt;br&gt;but is instead a practical one which is concerned with the uncovering of dialectical interconnections\u2026\u201d&lt;br&gt;(p. 61; emphases added). Schleiermacher himself puts it thusly: \u201cOur&lt;br&gt;observations here are not speculative but are in the strict sense of the word theoretical.\u201d&lt;br&gt;And the \u201cstrict sense\u201d of theory\u2014 captured in the ancient Greek theoria3\u2014 \u201crelate[s] \u201d&lt;br&gt;above all \u201cto a specific practice,\u201d as Schleiermacher himself goes on to explain (above,&lt;br&gt;p. 29; emphases added).",
