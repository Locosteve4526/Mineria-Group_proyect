        "Description/Abstract": "Despite the high demand of careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, the extent and access to focused K-12 STEM education varies across the country.  K-12 school libraries with their democratization of resources including both high- and low-/no- tech equipment can fill gaps by implementing makerspaces in the school library to provide and promote STEM learning and inquiry. This paper explores the use of high school library makerspaces for the purpose of implementing design learning as a way to integrate these subject areas and provide hands-on STEM learning opportunities for students through making. Librarians are equipped to facilitate such initiatives and collaborate with content area teachers to meet students\u2019 needs for STEM. ",
