        "Description/Abstract": "Flow field-flow fractionation with multi-angle light scattering  detection indicates that calsequestrin forms even-numbered aggregates,  supporting the view that this Ca2+ binding protein aggregates through  the interaction of dimers.  Contrary to previous reports based on size  exclusion chromatography FlFFF further indicates that the dimer is the  stable species, with very little monomer present under the conditions  analyzed in this study. Increasing the concentration of K+ (100-700 mM)  causes the dimer to be the increasingly dominant species over monomer,  tetramer, and other aggregate species. Increasing the concentration of  Ca2+ (3-10 mM) causes increased aggregation of dimers into higher order  species. Finally, addition of small amounts of the anthracycline analog  trifluoperazine (0.10\u20130.50 mM), which is known to disrupt  calsequestrin function, induces severe aggregation.",
