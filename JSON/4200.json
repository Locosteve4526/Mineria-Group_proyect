        "Description/Abstract": "To improve Community of Inquiry research, a group of researchers created the Community of Inquiry Questionnaire (CoIQ). While the development of the CoIQ is a step in the right direction, this instrument does not align as well as it could with previous research on each of the individual 'presences' (i.e., cognitive presence, teaching presence, social presence) that make up the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework. For instance, the questions in the CoIQ focused on measuring social presence do not align as well as they could with the previous indicators of social presence. This article outlines the misalignment encountered when using the CoIQ and highlights ways in which future research on communities of inquiry could be improved.",
