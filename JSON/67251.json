        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Respiratory Care programs are routinely asked to do more with less. Programs are increasingly reliant upon adjunct faculty as lower enrollments and decreasing state-appropriated funding make hiring full-time faculty difficult. While these subject matter experts are excellent practitioners, research has demonstrated there are serious drawbacks when compared to full-time faculty within the educational environment. This presentation will discuss strategies for how to bridge this gap while at the same time growing the next generation of rockstar educators.&lt;/span&gt;",
