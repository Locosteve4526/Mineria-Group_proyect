        "Description/Abstract": "The article talks about inquiry-based learning.  Inquiry-based learning  is about more than moving desks out of those neat rows and avoiding  lecture and recitation, says Jeff Wilhelm in his book &quot;Engaging Readers  &amp; Writers With Inquiry.&quot; Learning becomes as exciting as detective  work, because students see how the material is relevant. With inquiry,  teachers help students become aware of--and adept at--working with an  array of communities.?",
