        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this scoping review is to synthesize knowledge of gamified online course design processes and practices extracted from the peer-reviewed research literature. The scoping review followed a systematic process involving five main stages: (a) identifying research questions, (b) identifying relevant studies, (c) study selection, (d) charting the data, and (e) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. A total of 58 studies, published from 2013 through 2021 were included in this review. Five focus areas of gamified online course design were identified that include gamification elements, activities, tools, frameworks, and user attributes. The well-known ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) framework was used as a conceptual lens through which gamified online course design processes were considered. This scoping review addresses a gap in the knowledge base by aggregating and interpreting current gamified online course design practices through the common language of a well-known instructional design framework.&lt;/p&gt;",
