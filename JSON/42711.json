        "Description/Abstract": "Objectives: Students who seek assistance at a university writing center are looking to improve their skills and writing ability. Also, writing centers want to evaluate their ability to meet students\u2019 writing needs. Researchers have studied the effectiveness of writing center consultation in improving their writing skills, but no validated instrument to collect data from students exists. This article seeks to create just such an instrument. Methods: Following panel review, proposed scale items were administered to 357 undergraduate and graduate students who visited the writing center over a period of two months. An exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the identification of a usable set of questions. Results: Content validity was established conceptually and through expert panel review. Factor analyses supported a 13-item measure representing a single dimension. The items for the model shows both strong theoretical and statistical support. Conclusion: A usable instrument is now available, setting the groundwork for additional research.",
