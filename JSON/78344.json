        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;\u201cPrompt engineering\u201d is often touted as a way to positively incorporate AI in student learning. But just how assignments might implement prompt engineering to advance critical inquiry is underdeveloped. I will share two activities that actively engage students with GAI in a constructive and critical back-and-forth within the context of philosophy courses I teach at Boise State University.\u00a0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A version of this project is being presented at Innovate Idaho: Teaching and Learning with AI Symposium, April 3, 2025, 11:15 am-12:15 pm. https://event.fourwaves.com/innovateid25/pages&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
