        "Description/Abstract": "For nearly a half-century, social scientists have found that economic development's relationship to democracy is best understood as being nonlinear. In particular, the preferred specification is logarithmic, with democracy increasing in a fairly linear pattern until a point at which the relationship flattens out to nearly a horizontal line (or no relationship at all). Study after study models this relationship, but little recent theorizing exists to explain it. Rather like the Kuznets Curve being assumed without being understood, the Jackman Curve nears its 45th year without a contemporary explication. In this paper, I seek to first establish the Jackman Curve with both the most recent and the most distant data (2010-15 and 19th century), and then begin to provide a theoretical account for its presence. The result should confirm our understanding to the present day and give a modern theoretical presence.",
