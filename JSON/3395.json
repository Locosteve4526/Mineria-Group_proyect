        "Description/Abstract": "The usual construction of models of NFU (New Foundations with urelements,\nintroduced by Jensen) is due to Maurice Boffa. A Boffa model is obtained\nfrom a model of (a fragment of) ZFC with an automorphism which moves\na rank: the domain of the Boffa model is a rank that is moved. \u201cMost\u201d elements\nof the domain of the Boffa model are urelements in terms of the interpreted NFU.\nThe main result of this paper is that the restriction of the membership relation of\nthe original model of set theory with automorphism to the domain of the Boffa\nmodel is first-order definable in the language of NFU. In particular, all information\nabout the extensions in the original model of the urelements of the model of\nNFU is definable in terms of NFU. A corollary (answering a question of Thomas\nForster) is that the urelements in a Boffa model are not homogeneous.",
