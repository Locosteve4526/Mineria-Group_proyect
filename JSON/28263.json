        "Description/Abstract": "This paper contains a conceptual replication of (Herath &amp; Rao, 2009) in which they tested an Integrated Protection Motivation (PMT) and Deterrence (GDT) model of security policy compliance under the umbrella of the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior(TPB). We replicated their research model with the exception of one construct, Response Cost. Furthermore, all our data came from a single organization, and we referenced a specific security policy in this organization in our survey instrument. Our results that are based on 437 observations confirm some of the original findings but not all. Relationships stemming from Organizational Commitment, Resource Availability, Security Breach concern level and Subjective Norm are similar across both studies. The findings from other relationships drawn from PMT, GDT and TPB are mixed. We believe that the evidence provided in this conceptual replication of (Herath &amp; Rao, 2009) Integrated Model supports the robustness of parts of their model. We encourage future research and practice to focus on the parts of the model that were similar in both studies.\n",
