        "Description/Abstract": "In July 2013 a dense infrasound network was deployed for ~8 days at the active Sakurajima Volcano, Japan as part of the IAVCEI workshop, \u201cVolcano acoustics: from installation to analysis\u201d. This infrasound network was between ~2.5-6 km distance from the active vent and consisted of five Hyperion digital infrasound sensors deployed in a circle around the volcano and two collocated small-aperture 6-element arrays of MEMS-based broad-band pressure transducer sensors. All workshop-related data have been distributed to the workshop participants for future analysis. Two additional infrasound arrays with 4 and 5 sensors were deployed by the University of Bristol and Kyoto University (3.4 and 11.4 km). This infrasound network complements the long-standing multi-parameter monitoring network run by the Sakurajima Volcano Observatory (SVO), including four infrasound stations at 2.3-6.3 km. During this study period Sakurajima exhibited a relatively high level of volcanic unrest, producing numerous ash-rich explosive eruptions per day. \nIn this presentation we provide an overview of this unique infrasound dataset and highlight some of the scientific advances that are possible through a dense infrasound network combined with multiparameter observations. Preliminary analyses of the infrasound data show significant local propagation affects, as evidenced by substantial amplitude and waveform differences between two equidistant sites located on opposite sides of the volcano. Topography and crater morphology appear to play significant roles in local infrasound propagation at Sakurajima. Infrasound waveforms also vary considerably between eruptions, suggesting that the onsets of explosive volcanic eruptions are more complex than previously thought. High-amplitude infrasound was also recorded; with the largest explosion producing a remarkable peak pressure over 500 Pa at 2.5 km distance. Source localization techniques and future research directions in volcano infrasound will also be presented. \nThe geometry and arrangement of infrasound sensors offers the unprecedented opportunity to separate source processes from propagation and site effects. Additionally, the number and density of infrasound stations, full-azimuthal resolution, variety of sensors used, diverse eruptive activity, and extensive history of infrasound recordings by SVO make this a benchmark dataset that will yield abundant insight into volcano acoustics and eruption processes.\n",
