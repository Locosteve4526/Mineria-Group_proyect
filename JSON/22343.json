        "Description/Abstract": "Northern Paiute oral narratives are a fundamental means for sharing traditional knowledge of cultural history and adaptation. My work with elders from the Burns Paiute Tribe began in early 1997. The present work is intended primarily for use by the Tribe for the education of both youth and adults on the culture and history and imparted by the eldest speakers in the heritage language. Secondarily, the detailed analysis of naturally-occurring speech informs an understanding of the structure and use of this unique language.\r\nPartners:  The Burns Paiute Tribe of eastern Oregon\r\nDescription of Partner:  I have been working with elders from the Tribe for several years as we transcribe, translate, and analyze oral narratives of various genre in the critically endangered Northern Paiute language.\r\nRole:  Principal",
