The Radziwill family fortune in the 18th century was huge.  Estimates put it at 130-150 million zloty annually, making them one of the most wealthy families of central Europe in the 18th century, and their fortune was increased by energetic and accomplished representatives of the family.  In the Radziwill family, those energetic and accomplished individuals happened to be women.  This paper examines the contribution of women to the accumulation of the Radziwill family fortune.\r\n(This paper was read in absentia because I was not able to go to the conference.",
