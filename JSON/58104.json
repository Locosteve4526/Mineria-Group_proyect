        "Description/Abstract": "This study was conducted to (1) evaluate the potential of seed introductions in recovery efforts for Lepidium papilliferum through the use of ecologically realistic numbers of seeds across a large number of slick spots in an area recovering from wildfire, and (2) determine whether specific biogeochemical soil parameters influence germination success.  The data collected in this study will inform recovery efforts by providing insight into the prospects and limitations associated with the introduction of L. papilliferum seeds in unoccupied slick spots within disturbed sagebrush habitat.",
