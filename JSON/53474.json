        "Description/Abstract": "In this presentation, I discuss the asymmetry inherent in our relationship to children. I do this not to argue for equilibrium and balance in this relation but try to understand this asymmetry is particularly evident specifically in pedagogical engagement. The pedagogical relation is given its canonical description in a text from 1933 by Herman Nohl, who drew inspiration from Friedrich Schleiermacher. This text describes this relation as first of all taken on by the adult for the sake of the child; it is informed by what is best for the child both now and in the future. This relation demands a tactfulness that can be protective of both educator and educand (i.e. child or young person). However, it comes without the expectation that it is to be reciprocated. Finally, it is marked by an asymmetrical pathos, Nohl says that this consists in the child\u2019s loyalty to the adult, and the adult\u2019s love for the child, and is oriented to the child\u2019s present reality and future possibility.",
