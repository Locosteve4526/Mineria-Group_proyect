        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Nurse leaders depend upon resiliency skills to support their practice. It is important to provide opportunities for nursing students to learn, practice, and observe these skills, which are needed to navigate challenging work environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose: &lt;/strong&gt;This article describes the impact of a resiliency curricular component in a grant-funded BSN elective course, &lt;em&gt;Concepts of Primary Care&lt;/em&gt;. Program evaluation was performed using a pre/post-test format and two surveys, the Brief Resilience Scale (BSR) and Brief Resilience Coping Scale (BCRS).\u00a0 Three open-ended questions were administered upon completion of the elective course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: A concurrent, nested design was utilized with a thematic analysis undertaken to analyze qualitative data. Analysis of quantitative data was performed using descriptive statistics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results: &lt;/strong&gt;Undergraduate BSN students showed an overall increase in resiliency (BRS p =&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;0.112) (BCRS p = 0.064), and responses to open-ended questions supported the ability to apply and&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;analyze most of the resiliency skills presented during the didactic portion of the elective course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/strong&gt;This course promoted the development and refinement of undergraduate BSN&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;student resilience skills. Inclusion of resilience content also supported student professional development.\u00a0 \u00a0The addition of resiliency concepts and skills into&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;undergraduate nursing curricula is recommended to enhance the ability of novice nurses to address work-related challenges and promote career satisfaction for the future.&lt;/p&gt;",
