English language teaching provides an overarching opportunity to impact success and serve as a catalyst for the expansion of ideas, technology and innovative accomplishments in the Gulf. As all eyes are on the Gulf and its connection to every country on earth, strong leadership in English language teaching leading to quality educational experiences designed to meet the unique needs of all learners is particularly valuable. Embracing English language learning, new technologies, and initiating change through proactive leadership will lead to relevant and purposeful accomplishments.",
