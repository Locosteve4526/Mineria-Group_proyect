        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Ninety percent of U.S. colleges and universities offer conceptually based fitness and wellness (CBFW) courses meant to improve students\u2019 knowledge, and behavior relative to health, wellness and physical activity (PA). The purpose of this literature review was to investigate CBFW course content and structure, and review the effectiveness of courses or programs that sought to improve health and wellness perceptions and knowledge (HWP&amp;K), physical health (PH), and mental health (MH). Twenty-three (23) articles, published in English between 2003 and 2023, met our inclusion criteria (n = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;8059 subjects). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;The majority of courses (65%) focused on HWP&amp;K and PH outcomes, with positive physical outcomes such as increased PA; some offered a physical activity lab component. Courses that focused on MH strategies (35%) improved MH outcomes such as reduced perceived stress. There is an opportunity for college courses to adopt strategies that will improve MH outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;",
