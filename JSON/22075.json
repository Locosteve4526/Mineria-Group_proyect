        "Description/Abstract": "My current research project is generally titled \u201cPopulation Movement and Cultural Change in Zumberak,\u201d with Zumberak being a region of northern Croatia with a very specific set of cultural attributes, which emerged as a result of one concentrated, vital period of social change in the sixteenth century. I examine a number of issues over time in this work: (1) cultural change, (2) cultural stasis, (3) environmental change and its relationship to economic development and cultural chage, (4) the persistence of identity during periods of intense emigration (to the US, Australia, etc.), and (5) Zumberak as a refugee zone. I am currently at the point of being able to begin work on article manuscripts on several of these issues.  UPDATE FEB 2016: I have completed the manuscript of #5, &quot;Zumberak as a Refugee Zone.&quot; Soon to be submitted.\nRole:  Principal",
