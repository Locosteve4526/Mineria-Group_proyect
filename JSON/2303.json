        "Description/Abstract": "Many successful undergraduate mathematics students struggle learning to write proofs. Even students who may enjoy problem solving and prefer conceptual understanding can find the nonprocedural nature of proof-writing to be technically difficult and ambiguous. This qualitative study examines 23 undergraduate students\u2019 comprehension of one-to-one and onto proofs in a first course in abstract algebra. Data collected consisted of homework, in-class quizzes, and in-class tests. Through coding of student work, the researchers found students\u2019 misconceptions and errors depended on the specific abstract algebra topic and their mathematics background. Implications for teaching and research are also discussed.",
