        "Description/Abstract": "Klaus Mollenhauer (1928\u20131998) is one of the most important German theorists of education in the postwar era. Mollenhauer is often remembered in Germany today for his first book titled Education and Emancipation: Polemical Sketches, but he received international renown for his final monograph, Forgotten Connections: On Culture and Upbringing. Although Mollenhauer characterized Forgotten Connections as actually working to move towards a more \u201csubstantial conception of emancipation,\u201d many of his followers and colleagues such as Kaufmann et al. saw it as nothing less than an act of \u201cinfidelity to those who had taken on his emancipatory pedagogy\u201d (Kaufmann et al., 1991: 86). In the light of these differences in emphasis and interpretation, this paper provides an overview of Forgotten Connections that (following Wivestad and Saevi) sees it as presenting six main questions and themes.",
