        "Description/Abstract": "We show that the Waring rank of the $3 \\times 3$ determinant, previously\nknown to be between $14$ and $18$, is at least $15$. We use syzygies of the\napolar ideal, which have not been used in this way before. Additionally, we\nshow that the cactus rank of the $3 \\times 3$ permanent is at least $14$.\n[Journal_ref: ]",
