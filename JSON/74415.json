        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book offers a comprehensive examination of the sexual health challenges faced by international students in the United States. The book delves into various facets of the international student experience, including their enrollment trends, economic contributions, and academic and research impact, with a significant focus on the hardships they face, particularly in the realm of sexual health. The authors explore the historical context of international students in the U.S., noting the evolution of their presence from the late 1800s to the present day. They highlight the resilience of these students in overcoming language barriers, cultural adjustments, financial stress, and visa regulations. The book emphasizes the economic benefits that international students bring to the U.S., contributing to tuition revenue, local economies, and job creation. A major theme of the book is the underrepresentation of international students in health research and the unique perspectives they offer. The authors argue for the inclusion of international students in research studies to enhance the quality and relevance of health research. In addressing sexual health, the book examines the diverse cultural backgrounds of international students and the impact of these backgrounds on their sexual health behaviors and attitudes. It provides detailed analyses of sexual health cultures in various countries, highlighting the cultural norms and societal expectations that shape sexual health education and behaviors. Through personal narratives, academic research, and practical recommendations, the authors advocate for culturally sensitive sexual health education and resources to support international students, aiming to foster a more inclusive and understanding environment in U.S. educational institutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
