        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Studies by the Super League of Information Literacy show that library patrons encounter nearly 500 pieces of misinformation every day; while other studies (real ones) demonstrate that even well-educated and tech savvy people can fall prey to bogus statistics like the one above. Librarians have always been a first line of defense when it comes to navigating information, but what happens when the tools we use to teach source evaluation, like SIFT and the CRAAP Test, don't work as well as they used to? Enter lateral reading, a method used by professional fact-checkers to get around the &quot;it looks good&quot; or &quot;it seems okay&quot; mindset. Join librarians from Boise State University as we train you to train your patrons of all ages and experience levels how to evaluate sources through lateral reading and highlight our own findings about common misinformation issues lateral reading can improve.&lt;/span&gt;",
