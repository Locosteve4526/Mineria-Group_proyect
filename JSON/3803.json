        "Description/Abstract": "Recently, a number of scholars (e.g., Leask, 2006; Liu, 2005) have raised concerns about the discourse of plagiarism, arguing\r\nthat an emphasis on cultural difference has served to reinforce stereotypes of particular L2 groups and perpetuate deficit views of\r\nL2 learners. In an effort to address these concerns, the present study revisits Keck\u2019s own (2006) comparison of L1 and L2\r\nsummarization practices and investigates (1) why both L1 and L2 writers might choose to copy or Paraphrase source text language\r\nwhile composing a written summary and (2) whether the strategy use of novice writers differed from that of their more experienced\r\npeers. The study found that L1 and L2 writers identified many of the same excerpts to include in their summaries, excerpts which\r\nallowed them to introduce the problem in focus and to explain the author\u2019s thesis. The study also found that the higher rate of\r\ncopying observed for the L2 group as a whole could be explained by a small number of students who copied source text language\r\nextensively. In both the L1 and L2 groups, novice writers tended to rely more on source text excerpts than their more experienced\r\npeers.",
