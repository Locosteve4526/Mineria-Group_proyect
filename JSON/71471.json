        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;This research explores three broad questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are the relationships among formal and informal sales controls?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do formal and informal sales controls influence a salesperson\u2019s identification (commitment) versus compliance (submission) to an organization, and through these processes,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do formal and informal sales controls influence salesperson attitudes, behaviors, and performance?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\nWe develop a theoretical framework based on organizational identification and empirically test our hypotheses in a two-wave study among 750 business-to-business (B2B) salespeople across a variety of industries and organizations. We find that most types of sales controls support self-control and/or identification, while activity control simply leads to compliance. While both identification and compliance positively influence sales performance, identification (compliance) has a positive (negative) relationship with more long-term indicators of salesperson performance, like job satisfaction and loyalty. Our findings have implications for our understanding of how formal and informal controls fit together, their influence on organizational commitment, and their downstream effects on attitudes, behavior, and performance.",
