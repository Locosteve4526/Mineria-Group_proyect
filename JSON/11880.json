        "Description/Abstract": "In this paper we propose a refinement of Michener\u2019s (1978) well-known example classification based on data from university mathematicians. The refinement takes into account the mathematician\u2019s perspective on the role of examples in doing mathematics. More \nspecifically, our work provides insight into the ways in which mathematicians talk about using examples in their scholarly work and their work with students. The proposed classification has the potential to inform our work as teachers as we strive to create opportunities to engage students in authentic mathematical work.",
