        "Description/Abstract": "To determine intensity of Nintendo Wii Fit games using indirect calorimetry. Twenty-five college students completed Wii Fit activity sessions at two difficulty levels within aerobics, strength, and yoga categories. Resting metabolic rate and exercise VO2 were measured and metabolic equivalents (METs) were calculated. Measured METs and calculated METs ranged from 2.30 \u00b1 .42 and 2.44 \u00b1 .38 for Yoga to 5.73 \u00b1 1.36 and 6.04 \u00b1 1.09 for aerobics, respectively. All selected Wii Fit activity intensities were significantly higher than resting, p &lt; .001; aerobic and strength activities met the moderate intensity threshold (3 METs, p &lt; .001), yoga activities did not (p &lt; .005); aerobic and yoga activities of medium difficulty were more intense than the corresponding easy-rated activities (p &lt; .005). There were no statistical differences between measured and calculated METs. Wii Fit has potential as an effective tool for helping college-age individuals increase their PA.",
