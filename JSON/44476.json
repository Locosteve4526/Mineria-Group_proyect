        "Description/Abstract": "Following World War II, the United States pursued a foreign policy emphasizing the projection of American military power and construction of multilateral institutions to establish a liberal, rules-based international order. Recently the basic tenets of United States grand strategy have come under increased scrutiny. Some argue that the US can no longer afford to maintain its global military presence. Others argue that the United States remains entirely capable of maintaining these relationships, further arguing that the United States' military primacy actually yields substantial gains. However, the precise nature of these extended benefits remains unclear. In this paper, we find that the US security relationships have facilitated greater global economic integration. Importantly, these findings hold for relationships not directly involving the US. These findings have important implications for our understanding of trade liberalization, and the interplay between economics, security policy, peace and stability.",
