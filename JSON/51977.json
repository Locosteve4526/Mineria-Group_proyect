        "Description/Abstract": "Sales of marijuana for recreational purposes is illegal under federal law, but legal in several states.  Because they are selling drugs that are illegal under federal law, marijuana retailers (in states that allow the sale of marijuana)--unlike other businesses--cannot deduct many of the business expenses they incur on the their federal income tax returns.  Such retailers thus incur substantial federal income tax liabilities.  But if an Indian tribe sells marijuana on its reservation, then it pays no federal income tax on its profits.  This project will explore the disconnect between federal income tax policy towards Indian retailers versus non-Indian retailers and suggest options to address this issue. ",
