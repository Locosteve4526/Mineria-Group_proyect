        "Description/Abstract": "To develop a new material or to study microstructural evolution in materials requires techniques to determine their composition and structures. X-rays diffraction (XRD) technique is a nondestructive technique for physical properties characterization, which allows both qualitative and quantitative analyses. At Microscopy and Characterization Suite (MaCS), Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES), the Smartlab x-rays diffractometer provides capabilities to study radioactive materials which include phase identification, defect structures, microstructure changes, surface oxide structures, thin film or coating structures, and residual stress inside materials.",
