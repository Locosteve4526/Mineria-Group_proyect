        "Description/Abstract": "Previous research on gender differences between males and females on the risk factors leading to disordered eating is sparse, especially on males and eating disorders using attachment theory. This study examined the relationship between adult attachment style and disordered eating in men and women. Secure attachment scores were significantly negatively correlated with body dissatisfaction, and fearful attachment scores were positively correlated with bulimia in women. For men, secure attachment was significantly negatively correlated to drive for thinness, bulimia, and body dissatisfaction. Clinical implications are discussed.",
