        "Description/Abstract": "In recent years, education has emphasized the need for hands-on and active learning within the&lt;br&gt;classroom, but this learning environment should be expanded to include innovative teaching practices&lt;br&gt;that include the entire school campus. Learning outdoors has the potential to excite and reinvigorate&lt;br&gt;learners while capturing a broader spectrum of our student body including those that are language&lt;br&gt;learners or students who respond more to physical learning by doing. \u00a0\u00a0Participating in fieldwork,&lt;br&gt;\u201cprovides a place to contextualize learning in real world settings, acquire and develop technical and&lt;br&gt;life skills and as a place to enjoy\u201d (Fuller 2012). \u00a0As noted by Cooper and Wischemann (1987), these&lt;br&gt;outdoor spaces are valuable places for life learning and deserve much more attention for their&lt;br&gt;capacity to serve our campus communities\u2019 need for study, relaxation, and aesthetic enjoyment. By&lt;br&gt;emphasizing existing outdoor spaces for learning, we can call attention to the value and need for&lt;br&gt;protection of outdoor spaces that are often overlooked and underappreciated. These experiences will&lt;br&gt;equip all students with the knowledge and skills required for a STEM-driven (Science, Technology,&lt;br&gt;Engineering and Math) future and enhance science lessons to support multilingual students\u2019&lt;br&gt;engagement. We will provide examples from the campuses of Boise State University and Georgia&lt;br&gt;Gwinnett College of innovative ways to use campus grounds and resources for extending learning&lt;br&gt;opportunities beyond the traditional classroom environment.",
