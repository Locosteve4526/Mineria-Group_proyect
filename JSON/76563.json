        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;This is a global collaboration for which we were invited to participate. It was led by Dr. Clara Grilo from Portugal whom I have worked with on background for barn owl road mortality studies, which occur in Idaho as well as Portugal, among other global locations. Clara is led an integrated analysis of roadkill which now includes more than 100 collaborators who helped conduct the anlyses and c0author the paper. All data were gathered, analyses conducted, and the paper was accepted for publication as of December 2024. I have indicated that two of my former graduate students, Than Boves and Erin Arnold, are alsoauthors on the large collaborative paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decision Letter copied below:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Dr. Betlhoff,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here is a copy of the decision letter for manuscript &quot;Global Roadkill Data: a dataset on terrestrial vertebrate mortality caused by collision with vehicles&quot; by\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grilo et al.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;on which you were a Contributing Author.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can now use a single sign-on for all your accounts, view the status of all your manuscript submissions and reviews, access usage statistics for your published articles and download a record of your refereeing activity for the Nature Research journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Elizabeth Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Associate Editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientific Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;------------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subject: Scientific Data: Decision letter for SDATA-24-00894C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manuscript Number: SDATA-24-00894C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manuscript Title: Global Roadkill Data: a dataset on terrestrial vertebrate mortality caused by collision with vehicles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corresponding Author: Dr\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grilo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Dr\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grilo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thank you for making your final changes as requested.
