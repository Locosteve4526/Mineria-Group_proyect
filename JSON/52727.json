        "Description/Abstract": "A limited supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to frequent unsafe reuse of protective clothing by healthcare workers and the public.  The application of ozone gas to sterilize PPEs before reuse has been proposed. However, the potential damage caused to the fabric materials has not been reported in the scientific literature. A study was conducted to investigate changes in the elasticity of eight combinations of fabric materials exposed to ozone gas under controlled laboratory conditions.  No evidence of material degradation was found.  The results of this study suggest that the use of ozone gas to sterilize PPEs can be effective and may allow persons to reuse their equipment multiple times. ",
