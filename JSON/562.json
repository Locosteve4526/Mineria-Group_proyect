        "Description/Abstract": "In this article, we empirically analyze the effect of team characteristics on a\r\nteam\u2019s choice of group contract type (its governance structure) and examine\r\nthe combined impact of team characteristics and the group contract choice on\r\ngroup and individual performance in a classroom setting. We utilize endogenous dummy variable models in both group-level and individual-level analyses\r\ndue to the expected endogeneity of the contract choice. The estimation results\r\ncon?rm a statistically signi?cant positive effect of a governance structure, democratic contract that includes a mechanism to punish free-riders on both group\r\nand individual performance. We also estimate switching regression models to\r\naccount for the possible heterogeneous treatment effects but do not ?nd any\r\nsigni?cant difference between the treated and the nontreated in the effect of the\r\ndemocratic contract option implying that the contract choice is not necessarily\r\nmotivated by its performance-enhancing effect.
