        "Description/Abstract": "Bullying has captured national attention lately, as &quot;youthful teasing&quot; escalates to pervasive, malicious, even dangerous levels. Yet, if only bullying stopped at high school. Nursing schools, hospitals, and private practices may not see schoolyard taunts, but incivility in the workplace certainly exists. Many minority nurses and other health professionals still experience various forms of prejudice at the workplace\u2014not just from patients but each other. Here an expert on workplace bullying explores some examples and describes how nurses and schools of nursing can foster a more civil workplace.\n\n",
