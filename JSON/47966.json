        "Description/Abstract": "Hampton Lake, a recreational reservoir located in northern Nassau County, Florida, USA, was heavily impacted by the effects of Hurricane Irma. A combination of heavy precipitation and hurricane-induced high water stages in the St. Mary's River caused catastrophic failure of the earthen dam containing the reservoir and complete loss of the stored water. The failure was initially documented by a NSF supported Geotechnical Extreme Event Reconnaissance (GEER) reconnaissance site visit. After this initial effort, the investigation was expanded to evaluate the cause of the dam failure. During the storm event, the spillway was overtopped leading to toe erosion. Based on the analyses conducted to date, the most likely cause of the dam failure was erosion of the downstream embankment areas which were not adequately protected by riprap. Failure case studies are useful to design engineers around the world by providing &quot;lessons learned&quot; to improve future design efforts for similar projects.",
