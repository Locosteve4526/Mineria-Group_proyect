        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Background: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;There has been a push toward degree advancement throughout Respiratory Care, with many academic institutions creating graduate-level degree advancement programs. However, many practitioners are apprehensive about advancing their degrees past the entry-into-practice level. Little research exists regarding the benefits of a graduate-level degree in Respiratory Care through degree advancement (DA). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;A web-based survey was developed to identify the perceived benefits of completing a Master of Science in Respiratory Care (MSRC) program. Graduates from seven MSRC DA programs were asked to identify how efficacious the program was in preparing them for new or expanded roles, what types of financial support were received, whether there exists a financial benefit to obtain the degree, and whether the degree supported professional advancement. 299 Graduates were invited to complete the anonymous web-based survey. 101 surveys were initiated and 98 (32.8%) responses were analyzed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;72.4% of respondents indicated personal motivation for pursuing a graduate-level degree as well as a desire to stay in the field. 88.7% of respondents indicated that the program prepared them to assume new or expanded roles and 58.3% had experienced advancement. 44.9% of respondents did not receive tuition reimbursement for degree advancement and 87.8% did not receive any scholarship support towards the degree. Finally, graduates reported an average increase in salary of approximately $12,000. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Attainment of a graduate-level Respiratory Care degree through DA remains reliant on intrinsic motivation. Although over half of respondents indicated receiving tuition support through an employer, opportunities continue to exist to increase the degree of financial support for clinicians to advance education beyond the clinical requirements of licensure. However, graduates indicated that earning the degree supported educational development, contributed to new or advanced roles, and contributed to a tangible increase in annual salary. &lt;/span&gt;",
