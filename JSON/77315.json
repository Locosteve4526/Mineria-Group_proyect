        "Description/Abstract": "This study develops and tests a model of manager reporting credibility for different investor types. Specifically, we use an experiment to examine whether short-horizon investors differ from long-horizon investors in their sensitivity to truthful disclosure regarding negative earnings news. Short-horizon prospective investors exhibit an incremental sensitivity to forthcoming disclosure regarding negative earnings news compared to long-horizon current investors. Consistent with prior research, long-horizon current investors' assessments of reporting credibility are unresponsive to forthcoming earnings guidance. Similarly, short-horizon current investors exhibit differential sensitivity to forthcoming disclosure regarding negative news compared to long-horizon current investors. The results suggest truthful disclosure can positively impact managers\u2019 long-term reporting credibility. This effect is most significant for investors with short investment horizons when earnings news is negative. The results should inform managers interested in maximizing the effectiveness of their earnings guidance.",
