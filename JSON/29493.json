        "Description/Abstract": "This study investigates a novel method by examining the potential influence of a 12-week self-leadership class on math and reading achievement for 136 at-risk students attending a Northwest alternative high school.  This class included key features in self-regulated learning - including the use of metacognitive, motivational, and/or behavioral strategies.  We hypothesized that self-leadership capacity will be related to improved test scores because at-risk students who have increased abilities to lead themselves are better able to reduce risk-taking behavior, self-regulate their learning, and utilize skills related to metacognition to improve their academic achievement.  Our study followed a quasi-experimental design that used two sets of math and reading scores in two case and one control group to examine changes in math and reading scores.  Test score analysis revealed an improvement in only math scores for those attending leadership classes when controlling for students\u2019 GPA.  Implications suggest the importance of further research.",
