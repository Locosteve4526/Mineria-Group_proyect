        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Academic librarians are the ultimate interdisciplinarians, and would seem to be natural research collaborators, but many struggle to be seen as peers by other faculty or called on to fully partner in research projects even when key information literacy objectives are involved. This changed for an associate professor/librarian at Boise State\u2019s Albertsons Library when they were invited to join a team which was eventually awarded a Department of Homeland Security grant. This article examines the grant program, the grant awarded, and a librarian\u2019s contributions to achieving the project\u2019s objectives. It makes the case for libraries\u2019 essential role in strengthening our communities\u2019 resistance to the disinformation behind extremist belief and action.&lt;/span&gt;",
