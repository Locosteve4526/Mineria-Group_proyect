        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\nVulnerable populations account for a substantial proportion of the United States population. The current COVID-19\npandemic has highlighted the elderly and those with underlying health issues as having the highest risk of mortality.\nThis literature review utilizes a matrix approach to explore the challenges to providing care for the vulnerable\nelderly, those with underlying health issues, with disabilities, with low income or homelessness, and those with\nmental health concerns in these extreme times. Appropriate care for vulnerable populations in times of crisis\nrequires focus and planning in critical areas. This article discusses the critical areas of communications and trust,\npolicies and planning, resource allocation, and physical or digital provision of care. Care must be built around the\nanticipated needs of vulnerable populations and adapted to evolving conditions to minimize morbidity and mortality.\nThere is a need for further investigation and development of effective telehealth systems to address barriers and\nincrease inclusion of vulnerable populations. Effective provision of healthcare to vulnerable populations, such as the\nelderly, may prevent the need for resource-intensive critical care by maintaining health.\nKey Words: COVID-19, vulnerable populations, pandemic, crisis, elderly",
