        "Description/Abstract": " Umbilical cord blood (UCB) sourced allografts are promising interventions for tissue regeneration. As applications of these allografts and regulations governing them continue to evolve, we were prompted to identify parameters determining their quality, safety and regenerative potential.  Flow-cytometry, mass-spectrometry, protein multiplexing, nanoparticle tracking analysis and standard biological techniques were employed.  Quality attributes of a uniquely processed UCB-allograft (UCBr) were enumerated based on identity (cell viability, immunophenotyping, proteomic profiling, and quantification of relevant cytokines); safety (bioburden and microbiological screening), purity (endotoxin levels) and potency (effect of UCBr on chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes). These attributes were stable up to 24\u00a0months in cryopreserved UCBr.  We identified a comprehensive panel of tests to establish the clinical efficacy and quality control attributes of a UCB-sourced allograft.",
