        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\nThe increasing use of low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) for the fabrication of biological microfluidic devices necessitates further research on LTCC biocompatibility. In this study we explore the inhibitory effect of DuPont's 951 LTCC on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and demonstrate a novel mechanism to increase biocompatibility between LTCC and PCR with the addition of a common passivation substance, bovine serum albumin (BSA). We show that DuPont's 951 LTCC binds negatively charged proteins including BSA and ovalbumin (OVA). This is a significant discovery as proteins (enzymes) are an essential component of most biological reactions, and a frequent addition to microfluidic devices. A proposed model for LTCC inhibition of PCR by enzyme adsorption is presented.\n\nKeywords\nLTCC; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Microfluidics; Bovine serum albumin (BSA); Taq polymerase; Inhibition",
