        "Description/Abstract": "Variability in men\u2019s reproductive success (RS) is partly attributable to the ability of successful men to influence resource flows relevant to mate choice and reproduction of women. This study explores the effects of variability in resource flows on men\u2019s RS in an indigenous foraging/mixed-economy community in northern Siberia where monogamous marriage norms predominate. A series of material, embodied, and relational wealth indicators are tested as predictors of men\u2019s age-adjusted RS and age at first birth. Material wealth related to hunting, embodied wealth as represented by hunting skill, and relational wealth as represented by numbers of kin are the most consistent predictors of men\u2019s RS. In this monogamous population the wives of men with more hunting capital and men rated as better hunters have shorter inter-birth intervals, and hunters show strong producer priority. These findings and ethnographic observations appear more consistent with a provisioning model than a signaling-for-mates model. ",
