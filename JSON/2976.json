        "Description/Abstract": "As illustrated in this article, there are no such things as singular issues in politics. Be that\nas it may, no one will remember German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s remarks on\nimmigration in October of 2010 as being about anything other than immigration. We\nought to remember her remarks, however, more for what she didn\u2019t say than for what she\ndid say. Her deliberate (?) omission of salient facts regarding the history of the guest-worker agreement between Germany and Turkey shines just a hint of light on what we reveal to be a much broader pattern of denial that we describe as playing out here in the U.S. as a form of bad political theatre between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the theatre is only meant to distract us from the reality of the Leitkultur that we now share with nearly every country in our globalized world; namely, the market. This articles describes the role of this Leitkultur as well as the role of its denial in shaping public  perceptions on the issue of immigration, and offers the beginnings of a response to Slavoj\n\u017di\u017eek\u2018s call for a new Leitkultur defined in a manner that transcends national borders.",
