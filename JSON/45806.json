        "Description/Abstract": "Gene expression is controlled by nuclear structure which is modulated by both internal and external forces exerted on the nucleoskeleton. Extracellular forces experienced through the actin cytoskeleton are transmitted to the internal nucleoskeleton via Linker of Nucleus and Cytoskeleton (LINC) protein connections. LINC complexes directly alter nuclear shape and entry of molecules that regulate transcription. New mechanistic models indicate that nuclear actin is a dynamic component of the filamentous nucleoskeleton and modified by an intranuclear &quot;actin toolbox&quot;, a set of enzymes that regulate linear and branched polymerization of nuclear actin. External stimulation of both biomechanical and biochemical pathways alters nuclear actin structure and has profound effects on gene expression by controlling chromatin architecture and transcription factor access to gene targets. The available data indicate that nucleoskeletal control of gene expression is critical for self-renewal and mesenchymal lineage-allocation in stem cells.",
