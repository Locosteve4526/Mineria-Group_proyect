        "Description/Abstract": "We report high-yield and efficient size-controlled syntheses of Chalcopyrite CuInS2 nanoparticles by decomposing molecular single source precursors (SSPs) via microwave irradiation in the presence of 1,2-ethanedithiol at reaction temperatures as low as 100?C and times as short as 30 minutes. The nanoparticles sizes were 1.8nm to 10.8 nm as reaction temperatures were varied from 100?C to 200?C with the bandgaps from 2.71 eV to 1.28 eV with good size control and high yields (64%\u201395%). The resulting nanoparticles were analyzed by XRD, UV-Vis, ICP-OES, XPS, SEM, EDS, and HRTEM. Titration studies by 1H NMR using SSP 1 with 1,2-ethanedithiol and benzyl mercaptan were conducted to elucidate the formation of Chalcopyrite CuInS2 nanoparticles.",
