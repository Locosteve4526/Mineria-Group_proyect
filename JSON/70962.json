        "Description/Abstract": "Objective: Establishment and spread of invasive species depend on how well the species&lt;br&gt;acclimates and adapts to new local conditions.\u00a0We subjected adult oriental weatherfish Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (n = 47) to four\u00a0treatment combinations of two temperatures (30 0 C and 40 0 C) and two substrate moisture levels\u00a0(&amp;lt; 20% VMC and \u2265 50% VMC) in a regulated temperature and moisture control chamber in the\u00a0laboratory to test survivability under these conditions.\u00a0At the high substrate moisture level (\u2265 50% volumetric moisture content (VMC)) and\u00a0warm temperature (30 0 C), oriental weatherfish survived up to 184 days. In both high substrate\u00a0moisture (\u2265 50% VMC) and dry substrate (&amp;lt; 20% VMC), at hot temperature (40 0 C), the fish did\u00a0not survive for more than a few days. At 30 0 C and dry substrate (&amp;lt; 20% VMC), oriental\u00a0weatherfish survived up to 25 days.\u00a0Our results indicate a tolerance of 30 0 C and substrate moisture \u2265 50% VMC, is a\u00a0strong indicator of range expansion ability and invasive risk by the burrowing, air-breathing fish,\u00a0oriental weatherfish. This knowledge can be used by managers to better predict range\u00a0expansions under a changing climate.",
