        "Description/Abstract": "The Iwokrama rainforest is a reserve of 371,000 hectares located in  central Guyana (see Figure 1).  Following its establishment in 1989,  Williams (1996) conducted intuitive exploratory surveys of this  little-known region and established a preliminary chronology of the  reserve sites.  These findings are complimented by recent investigations  in the Iwokrama Mountains and along the Essequibo River (Plew 2002a,  2002b).  Presently, archaeological data indicate significant Archaic and  Horticultural occupations. A total of twenty-nine sites have been  recorded.  While no evidence of Paleo-Indians has been identified, it  appears likely that evidence may come to light in the future, given what  appears as a presence in Guyana and the Amazonian basin.  It seems  likely that Paleo-Indians utilizing the northern Rupununi would have  intruded into the Iwokrama forest.",
