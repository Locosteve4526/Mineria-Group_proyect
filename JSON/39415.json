        "Description/Abstract": "In this work, a chalcogenide-based memristor, driven into a differential negative resistance operating mode, is characterized through a series of voltage-controlled current measurements as a function of temperature.  The temperature is varied from 10 K to 300 K in order to investigate electron tunneling, hopping, localized states, and extended states conduction mechanisms. The data is used to investigate the source of room temperature tunneling in the device.",
