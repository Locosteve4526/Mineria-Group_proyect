        "Description/Abstract": "Classical symmetric key systems are build over algebraic structures based on the binary group. We have discovered over the last two years that these systems can be generalized over other finite groups, leading to deep new problems and exciting possibilities, and requiring techniques not used in prior research on symmetric key systems. \r\nRole:  Principal",
