        "Description/Abstract": "Melvin Van Peebles\u2019s 1971 film Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song has often been associated with the American Black Power and Black Liberation movements of the late-1960s and early-1970s. Ensuring that link shortly after the film\u2019s release, Huey Newton, leader of the infamous Black Panther Party, published a \u201cRevolutionary Analysis\u201d of the film in the organization\u2019s newspaper. Newton saw the film as a call to arms, and urged young black men and women to attend to the doubled meanings inherent in many of its crucial scenes. Without Van Peebles\u2019s clever use of \u201csignifying,\u201d Newton wrote, the \u201ccorporate capitalist\u201d would never have allowed for the distribution of such a potentially incendiary film.\r\nIn this paper I will reconsider Sweet Sweetback..., not to reevaluate its racial politics or its position in 1970s cinema, but to look more closely at Van Peebles\u2019s labor practices in light of more recent developments in American politics. On this front, two aspects of the film in particular are noteworthy: first, Van Peebles\u2019s willingness to train unskilled and inexperienced crewmembers to ensure that at least half of those involved in the film\u2019s production would be African-American; and second, his willingness to flout the rules of Hollywood by employing a non-union crew. While the latter was explained as a simple necessity given the film\u2019s miniscule budget, I believe it is worth returning to these two practices, to consider them side-by-side at a moment when the American politics of race and labor have come to be viewed as virtually mutually exclusive. Reading Sweet Sweetback... in relation to the analyses of labor and race found in Dan Georgakas\u2019s and Marvin Surkin\u2019s Detroit: I Do Mind Dying (1975), and Judith Stein\u2019s Pivotal Decade (2010), I will argue that Van Peebles\u2019s film, while a landmark in revolutionary racial politics, was also the harbinger of an emerging neoliberalism.",
