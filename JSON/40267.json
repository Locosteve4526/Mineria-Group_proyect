        "Description/Abstract": "Academic librarians teach students to research using academic databases and peer-reviewed\narticles. Information literacy skills combat misinformation in a student\u2019s academic career and\nbeyond the classroom. However, once students leave campus and cross the border from student\nlife to working life, they may not have access to peer-reviewed literature. Using a popular\nsegment of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; about scientific studies, this article presents the\nimportance of, and barriers to, students\u2019 continued access to peer-reviewed research. How\nlibrarians might mitigate these obstacles are discussed.",
