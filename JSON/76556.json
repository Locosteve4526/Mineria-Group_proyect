        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Heeding the call for equity and transformative praxis in teacher education, teacher education programs often focus on equity and justice in mission statements and program design. This bounded case study explores how the construct of equity stance is framed by one teacher education program and then how the enactment of an equity stance is actualized in clinical field experiences. Feedback from clinical supervisors during observation cycles along with focus group interviews, surveys, and the examination of addressing an equity stance in teacher education are the focus of this article. Findings documented a continuum of equity enacted practices building from inclusive pedagogy to a heightened awareness of inequities, and the development of more equitable teaching practices. We recognize that both teacher candidates and teacher educators need to continue development of an equity stance moving from awareness to action within educational contexts.&lt;/span&gt;",
