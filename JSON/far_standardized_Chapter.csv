Modeling the propagation and scattering of electromagnetic (EM) waves in soil is, hence, more challenging than in air or in other less complex media. This chapter will explain fundamentals of the numerical modeling of EM wave propagation and scattering in soil through solving Maxwell's equations using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The chapter will explain how: (i) the lossy and dispersive soil medium (in both dry and fully water-saturated conditions), (ii) a fourth phase (anomaly), (iii) two different types of transmitting antennae (a monopole and a dipole), and (iv) required absorbing boundary conditions can numerically be modeled. This is described through two examples that simulate the detection of DNAPL (dense nonaqueous-phase liquid) contamination in soil using Cross-well radar (CWR). CWR —otherwise known as cross-borehole GPR (ground penetrating radar)—modality was selected to eliminate the need for simulation of the roughness of the soil-air interface. The two examples demonstrate the scattering effect of a dielectric anomaly (representing a DNAPL pool) on the EM wave propagation through soil. The objective behind selecting these two examples is twofold: (i) explanation of the details and challenges of numerical modeling of EM wave propagation and scattering through soil for an actual problem (in this case, DNAPL detection), and (ii) demonstration of the feasibility of using EM waves for this actual detection problem.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/civileng_facpubs/22,"[{""id"": 24592, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2011/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

As Martin Jay points out, the metaphor of the constellation also travelled from Benjamin via Theodore Adorno to America and back to Europe, to re-emerge in Adorno’s postwar writings while he was at the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. As Jay explains, in the context of this exchange, the term constellation signified “a juxtaposed rather than integrated cluster of changing elements that resist reduction to a common denominator, essential core, or generative first principle” (1984, pp. 14-15). These characteristics also generally apply to the term “constellation” as I consider it here. In the instance of travel that is my principle focus, Giedion serves as an indispensable conduit between Benjamin and McLuhan. I close with a comparison of the implications of McLuhan’s use of the constellation with those of Benjamin’s earlier use of the term, and how it reflects the modernist historiography particular to each thinker.",,[],http://learningspaces.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Wandering-Star-BenjaminGiedionMcLuhan21.pdf,"[{""id"": 24658, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2015/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 24658, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2013/01"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

These issues include the development of technical media that were profoundly reshaping nearly all aspects of everyday reality in Dewey’s time.

It is therefore surprising how rarely instructional theories, methods and applications -e.g., learning theories learning designs or learning environments ? are considered specifically as technologies in the relevant literature. This chapter focuses on the instrumental nature of the concept ‘learning’ and learning theory, which Gert Biesta and others have characterized as being manifest in a ‘new language of learning.’ This refers to a vocabulary or discourse that, for example, characterizes ‘‘teaching’ [as the] ‘facilitation of learning’ [and], ‘education’ [as the] ‘provision of learning opportunities’’ (Haugsbak & Nordkvelle, 2007, p. 2). The paper argues that this vocabulary represents a particular technologization or instrumentalization of education, a process that makes educational practices and priorities appear germane to, or even incomplete without, technological rationalization and reshaping. This paper traces how this vocabulary casts learning as a natural and universal process, and quite consistently accompanies the promotion of a range of technological artifacts in education. Running from the introduction of ‘teaching machines’ through to current visions of school reform, this theoretical lexicon will be shown to efface its cultural and ideological contingency through a quasi?scientific ‘neutrality’ and a biologically?based universality, and to limit the possibility for educational discourse and practice.",,[],http://learningspaces.org/papers/langoflearning.pdf,"[{""id"": 24662, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2013/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The Somali-Bantu are descendants of Tanzanian Kizigua (G31; ziw) speakers who have been estranged from their homeland since the 18th century. Little is known of the Somali variety, and literature on the Tanzanian variety is mostly limited to its tonology (Kenstowicz 1989; Kenstowicz & Kisseberth, 1990; Kisseberth, 1992). This paper reports acoustic and aerodynamic data collected to accurately describe stops in Somali Chizigula. Findings include a contrast between voiced aspirated plosives and implosives, as well as the complete devoicing of the nasal portion of the voiceless prenasalized stop. However, aerodynamic data confirms nasal airflow during the nasal, leading to our assessment of the current state of prenasalized stops in the language as not having undergone effacement, as in other Bantu languages.",,[],,"[{""id"": 25896, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2016/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 25896, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2015, ""termid"": ""2015/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 25896, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/02"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}]"

Our focus is on nuclear sci-entists and engineers, and the interventions that might be made to prepare them for nov-el kinds of climate disruptions and how these disruptions could affect plant design and operations. Events at Fukushima in 2011 prompted renewed attention to nuclear safety. Soon after, scientists recorded record-breaking global temperatures, particularly during the summer of 2012. Perhaps as a result of these two events, academics and the media have begun asking whether nuclear power plants are robust to natural events beyond the range of historical data, including climate-related events such as increasing drought and rising cooling-water temperatures. Science policy scholars, scientists, and engineers outside of nuclear science and engineering have begun to pose similar questions and model possible effects. Our study demonstrates that there is almost no public discourse and very little professional discourse within nuclear science and engineering on this top-ic. We posit that this is largely because of the insular culture and professionalization standards of nuclear science and engineering, which will limit the effectiveness of cur-ricular interventions made in engineering education.",,[],http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319161716,"[{""id"": 26736, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2015, ""termid"": ""2014/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Much of the rapid expansion of online video can be attributed to YouTube, which has become the largest and most popular video-sharing platform online. The development of visual and media literacy (VML) competencies is valuable when engaging with social media content and technologies like YouTube. This chapter illustrates how visual and media literacies have been integrated within a set of educational YouTube video projects in an online university course that has been offered regularly since 2008. The projects discussed in this chapter were designed for an audience of adult educators, but have applicability in K-16 classrooms. YouTube was selected as the central video platform for several reasons, which include practical, technological, and societal factors. Competencies described in published definitions of visual and media literacy frame the discussion. Curation projects involve finding, interpreting, and evaluating video resources, which are grouped into collections for educational purposes. Educational video creation projects include video blogs, remix, PowerPoint movies, and interactive video.",,[],http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319058368,"[{""id"": 26962, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2015, ""termid"": ""2015/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,27579,112139145,112139145,The Mother's Mark on the Daughter's Speech in The Woman Warrior,2016,,,,978-1-68217-394-7 (hardcover);  978-1-68217-395-4 (e-book),"The Mother’s Mark on the Daughter’s Speech in The Woman Warrior In The Woman Warrior, Kingston draws on many resources to develop a story about her protagonist’s individual development. As the daughter of Chinese immigrants, she finds herself investigating selfhood in more than individual terms. Her story is suffused with uncertainty, fantasy, and ambiguity, all of which she navigates through dramatic metaphors of voice and writing. The book as a whole challenges its readers to consider the ways that language frames and generates meaning, showing that selfhood is shaped by culture. In this chapter, I will draw upon three categories—prohibition, inscription, and incision—to examine Kingston’s responses to her mother and her legacy as the child of Chinese immigrants. In particular, I will focus on the fact that, in a book rich with ambiguities, Kingston makes it clear that selfhood is not achieved in isolation. Although individuation is important for self-development, selves mature in relation to family, history, language, and the contemporary world. Kingston figures these relationships in several ways, but the mother’s role in embodying or mediating most of them is a consistent theme throughout the book. By focusing on Kingston’s references to prohibited speech, writing, and scarification (in the form of tattooing or surgical cutting), I will demonstrate some of the ways in which The Woman Warrior portrays selfhood in dynamic and contingent terms, as a process. Kingston prominently features the role of writing in the articulation of this process, implying that selfhood is an ongoing negotiation instead of a finished condition. The first chapter of The Woman Warrior, “No Name Woman,” begins and ends with a dramatic prohibition. However, the very existence of the chapter, as Kingston’s narrator makes clear, is an ironic violation of that prohibition. By beginning her book in this way, Kingston shows that her protagonist Maxine must engage with the past in order to grow up. She must violate the prohibition against telling the story of No Name Woman in order to articulate her sense of herself and the world that has produced her, and readers must conspire with her in the violation in order to proceed with the text. To accompany Maxine on her adventure of self-knowledge—the adventure of becoming a woman with a name and an identity—readers must trudge with her through a taboo. What does this violation lead to or make possible? In “White Tigers,” one answer seems to be that the narrator is now more free to invent and test new models of identity, a process which depends on the imaginative use of language. In this chapter, Kingston foregrounds the role of writing in the development of her protagonist Maxine, partly through metaphors of Chinese script, as when she likens a bird to “the ideograph for ‘human’” (20), and partly through depicting writing in the form of scarification, as when the litany of revenges is carved into the skin of her protagonist’s back (34-35). In the fantasy interlude in which she imagines herself as Fa Mu Lan, Kingston’s narrator begins to exercise her powers of language to produce more satisfying models of selfhood, models that might withstand the negative pressures of her environment. In the event, this first experiment articulates some important lessons about self-development (such as making mental “room for paradoxes” [29]), but it produces a model which proves only partially adequate or temporarily convincing to Kingston’s protagonist. If the tattooing of the crimes upon Fa Mu Lan’s back provides one example of incision as a phase in the development and growth of the Maxine’s soul, however, it is not the only bodily mutilation that she experiences. The ritual scarification results in an elegant though grisly script that inaugurates her hero’s quest, but Kingston refers to another form of incision in the last chapter of her book. In that chapter, “A Song for a Barbarian Reed Flute,” Kingston’s narrator alleges that her mother cut her frenum, a membrane connected to the tongue. Readers have noted that Kingston both posits this event as factual and undercuts it as unverifiable, since the putative event happened in infancy and the narrator has no recollection of it. The storytelling associated with the event comes to function as a fable because the mother’s stated purpose of cutting the frenum was to liberate the daughter’s speech. Brave Orchid’s argument is that the narrator’s frenum was unduly restrictive, rooting her daughter’s tongue in a position that marred its capacity for speech, especially for speech in more than one language. Hence the action was intended to support her daughter by giving her access to multiple worlds or cultures, an access she needs in order to function as a native-born American daughter of Chinese immigrants. Regardless of the narrator’s conflicted feelings about that maternal support, her decision to end her memoirs with the story about the Barbarian flute song gives the last word not to herself alone but to both her mother and herself, in the form of a collaboration. This choice is Kingston’s final reminder that selfhood is social.",,[],,"[{""id"": 27579, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 27579, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2015/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 27579, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2015, ""termid"": ""2015/02"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}]"
FAR,27580,112139145,112139145,Translation and Transatlantic Crossings in Kevin Young’s Ardency,2016,,,,,"Note: Jean Scheper sent an acceptance email on January 15, 2016, then wrote back on January 27, 2016 to indicate this was a mistake, without explaining why. This turned out to be another instructive exercise in futility. Translation and Transatlantic Crossings in Kevin Young’s Ardency In Ardency (2011), Kevin Young offers a series of interlinked poems depicting the Amistad case, in which enslaved Africans managed to secure their freedom and return to Africa after a prolonged legal battle. In his book, Young resurrects the dead by depicting their words on the pages of his poem, but he reminds his readers that this very process is a translation of experience into representation. Moreover, by focusing on the sailor James Covey’s role as a translator for the Amistad Africans, Young figures him as an alter ego of the poet. In identifying himself with Covey, Young stresses the transatlantic passage of the slave-trade together with the central role of language in the Amistad case. Early in his book, Young subtly suggests the connection between his poetry and the act of translation when Covey asks himself, “Could this be my fate, / my invisible art, to translate an opaque race?” (21). Young plays on the etymological sense of translation and metaphor (“carrying across”) in a wish Covey conveys to his adoptive white father at the close of a letter: “May my words / reach you in manners I never can, crossing boundless blue between” (22). Through this ritual-like valediction, Young figuratively links written communication to the transatlantic crossings of the Middle Passage and the eventual return to Africa of the Amistad rebels. Young turns Covey’s work as translator into a more general allegory of the poet, who translates or bears the words of the past into the present, making them live in a new context. Young’s poetic impersonations of Covey as well as the Amistad rebels “carry over” and transform not only the archival records documenting their struggle, but also the Amistad poems of Elizabeth Alexander (2005) and Robert Hayden (1945/1962).

FAR,27687,111110214,111110214,Environmental Justice,2014,CQ Press/ Sage,,,,"Environmental justice refers to the fact that racial and ethnic minority communities bear a disproportionate share of the impact of environmental pollution in the U.S. because those communities are located in or near industrial polluters and toxic waste sites. It is a field of study within the social and environmental sciences as well as a social movement by the same name. In the 1980s, researchers began documenting the fact that racial and ethnic minorities in the United States were more likely to live in or near pollution. By 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency had established an Office of Environmental Justice and federal policy began to focus on ensuring that environmental regulations were applied justly across all segments of U.S. society. Researchers have explained the fact that people of color are more likely to live near environmental pollution by seeking to unravel the effects of historic racial zoning laws, limited economic choices in housing for low income residents, the relative powerlessness of racial minorities in the political process, and overt racism. Translating the science of environmental justice to policy is made complex by two factors. The minority-location studies typically express correlations, or connections, among variables, but do not suggest concrete solutions. Scientists have also examined the impacts of the pollution on those who live nearby by tracing incidences of disease in those populations and comparing those rates to the general population. This type of science establishes relationship between living in an area and a greater than expected rate of disease, but does not prove that any one incidence of cancer is related to a particular toxic waste site. These factors contribute to the debate over the reliability of science in making remediation for exposure to pollutants or in guiding future decisions.",,[],,"[{""id"": 27687, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,33196,111341916,111341916,Martyrdom and the Creation of Christian Identity,2020,Wiley-Blackwell,,,,"Martyrdom is widely considered to be a critical part of Christian identity. However, the wide-ranging application of this conclusion in scholarship reveals its continued indebtedness to a theological understanding of martyrdom. Martyrdom necessarily includes the death of the martyr and the overwhelming majority of Christians have not been martyrs. Thus, in a very real sense, martyrdom is not part of Christian identity. The seeming malleability of martyrdom reveals the substitution of the martyr’s death with a theological construct that might be called 'willingness to suffer.’ This substitution is enabled by the use of 'identity,’ a term that is characterized by imprecise boundaries between categories of analysis and of practice. Enabled by this imprecision, scholarship on martyrdom has sought to recreate the Christian group identity of martyrdom on an individual level. This has lead to theses about the widespread development of Christian martyrdom based on limited evidence that perpetuates misunderstandings about intentional self-death. I propose that when studying Christian martyrdom, we intentionally isolate the theological justifications that support ‘willingness to suffer,' which are broadly inculcated in Christian self-understanding, from the act of martyrdom itself. This will allow the exploration of the comparatively rare phenomenon of martyrdom from non-theological perspectives as well closer analysis of how martyrdom's existential impact has been leveraged in Christian institution-building.",,[],,"[{""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2019/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}, {""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}, {""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2016/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/02"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}]"

FAR,36151,113069150,113069150,The Establishment roots of the liberal media critique,2018,,,,,"The notion that a loose association of individuals, groups, and institutions dominated American postwar political culture went unquestioned within conservative circles by the early 1960s. This Establishment, as National Review labeled it, and the journalists and news outlets deemed integral to its functioning typically are considered centrist by the standards of the time. Yet the idea that the mainstream media betray a liberal bias, which developed on the right during the 1950s and gained widespread acceptance the following decade, initially was grounded in arguments about the Establishment. This chapter will examine how National Review and publisher William Buckley, Jr. - despite representing a sort of Establishment conservatism themselves - embedded the idea of liberal media bias in their argument about the existence and character of the American Establishment during the late 1950s and early 1960s, intertwining the two concepts and laying the foundation for widespread acceptance of both. Buckley had pitched the journal from its start in 1955 as a necessary counter to what he judged a liberal postwar political structure that was biased against conservatism. Editorials, columns, and other content regularly reinforced the charge that a “Liberal Machine” ran the nation and forced conformity with its way of thinking with aid from the mainstream media that functioned as its “propaganda machine.” Editors and contributors eventually began to charge individual journalists and news institutions with belonging to or serving as mouthpieces of an American Establishment, which editor Frank Meyer described as “men inspired by so essential a unity of belief on fundamental matters that consultation, organization, detailed agreement, is unnecessary,” and by the Goldwater campaign of 1964 such claims were commonplace. These efforts were part of National Review’s attempt to sow distrust of a post-industrialist power structure that favored the liberal values of “knowledge elites,” including the mainstream media. There was an element of self-interest at play, as the journal sought to attract investors and readers by offering itself as an alternative to traditional news sources. More significantly, however, the journal worked to forge a cohesive movement capable of challenging the prevailing political culture - a culture it argued was directed by the American Establishment - by fashioning “a symbolic collective identity” for Americans displeased with this culture and by casting liberals as a common enemy against which they could unite. These efforts thus helped link popular discontent with conservative intellectualism. The right’s efforts to cast doubt on the credibility of the mainstream media is not a new phenomenon but one that dates back several decades, and this chapter will address how National Review simultaneously branded the Establishment and the media as liberal, linking the two ideas and helping to strengthen the ideological divide taking shape.",,[],,"[{""id"": 36151, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 36151, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2017/01"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

This rhetorical analysis deploys a material-discursive understanding of rhetoric, a theory of language in which meaning is shaped by an affective relationship between physical, or material, reality and discourse, which can include historical and cultural articulations of place, often rooted in deeply entrenched power dynamics. This methodology is deployed to contextualize the growing synchronicity and cooperation between the overt alt right white nationalism as seen in the 2017 ‘Unite the Right’ rally in Charlottesville and the far right patriot movements as seen in the 2014 standoff at Cliven Bundy’s ranch and the 2016 armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. In an effort to better understand the communicative practices of far right groups in the United States that aim to form alliances across shared ideologies, connecting identity to land, this chapter explores the convergence of far right white nationalism and the frontier narratives that animate the mythic west—where the social imaginary coheres to the physical landscape.",,[],,"[{""id"": 42939, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,46492,114106117,114106117,Behavioral Indicators of Dominance in an Adversarial Group Negotiation Game,2021,Springer,,,,"Adversarial group negotiations often involve contentious strategies such as deception and dominance. Understanding characteristics of language and voice associated with deception and dominance helps negotiators identify the use of these strategies and achieve higher self-interests in various use cases, including business negotiations and law enforcement. We aim to expand traditional research on these characteristics from dyadic interactions to group communication. This study follows the same group experiment, a modified Mafia game, as described in the other chapters. Linguistic and vocalic features were extracted from the recorded audio files, and several models were built to examine the predictors of perceived dominance and deceptive cues. Our results show that some features are significantly correlated with dominance as suggested by the existing research, such as lower fundamental frequency, greater variability in loudness, higher voice quality, longer turn-at-talk duration, larger dominance ratio and a greater number of words. However, some features turn out not to be significantly correlated with dominance, such as mean level of loudness, polarity of emotions, hedging ratio and disfluency ratio, though the existing research predicts these relationships. Among our explored features, only turn-at-talk duration is significantly correlated with deceptive status. Our research shows preliminary evidence for the similarities and differences of signals of dominance and deception in dyads and groups and has implications for negotiators in real life.",,[],,"[{""id"": 46492, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2020/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 46492, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2019/03"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}]"

FAR,51275,112139145,112139145,Mary Oliver's Debt to Emerson,2021,Salem / Grey House,,,,"Mary Oliver’s Debt to Emerson In 2000 Mary Oliver published an introduction to a volume of Emerson’s work. His impact on her writing and imagination is significant, though her poetic voice is distinctly her own. One aspect of Oliver’s debt to Emerson is evident in the Whitmanic strain in her writing. Oliver writes that Whitman’s “words,” are “a spiritual and a physical touching” (Upstream 104). Such dualism courses throughout the writing of Oliver, Whitman, and Emerson. Even though all these writers cherish the physical world for itself, they also view it as an embodiment of the spiritual. In a rare interview, Oliver expresses this Emersonian idea to Renee Olander: “The world of nature is the great warehouse of our figurative language.” In Nature, Emerson famously writes of his dramatic union with the natural world, portraying himself as a “transparent eyeball” to emphasize his transcendent connection to the universe. Oliver is less grandiose, but she takes the spiritual just as seriously as he does. In her essay “Perfect Days,” for instance, she attests to a spiritual union with the natural world, but unlike Emerson she valorizes the ordinary (Long Life 32-34). She even prefers it to the extraordinary as the token of the authentic. Nevertheless, she shares Emerson’s commitment to the epiphanies of nature. Indeed, attentiveness to the natural world is a key link between Oliver and Emerson. For Oliver, Ezra Pound’s claim rings true: “the natural object is always the adequate symbol.”",,[],https://www.salempress.com/Media/SalemPress/samples/CI%20Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson%20final%20ToC.pdf,"[{""id"": 51275, ""status"": ""Work Discontinued"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/01"", ""listingorder"": 7, ""completionorder"": 1}]"

We use a dialogic approach to wrestle with this question drawing from our experience of working with movements against extractivism in Pakistan and Colombia. Resource geographies are constituted by embodied spatial practices, and social movements are rich sites of knowledge creation that can follow alternative epistemologies. Instead of considering social movements as objects of investigation, we focus on our own positionality, the performance of academic learning, and the embodied and performative aspects of these struggles that may contradict and even potentiate our modalities of learning about these conflicts. To do so, we explore action research and radical performance geography as approaches for doing critical resource geographies. This dialogue centers around a set of questions on the ethics, modalities, tools, and outputs of action research that lies at the intersection of political action and investigation.",,[],,"[{""id"": 51763, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/02"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}]"

In this sense Stimmungen can be said to fundamentally atmospheric. It is a shared mood or atmosphere that determines the way that the world is disclosed to us—meaning that atmospheres possess a deeply epistemic, hermeneutic dimension. If every atmosphere brings with it a shared interpretation of the world, then one needs to share or participate in this atmosphere in order to share in knowledge or learning. Only when a Stimmung suitable to such disclosure has been cultivated or encountered will the sought‐after knowledge “dawn” on one, as Bollnow puts it (2017, p. 1414; 1956, p. 57). It goes without saying that Bollnow’s statement has significant implications for pedagogy, for teaching and learning as fundamentally atmospheric experiences, and these are explored in this paper. But I begin by discussing the elusive epistemology of the atmospheric itself—what we are able to know about how we know, what access we have to the atmospheric, to the mode of our being and knowing. Then, through an illustrative video example, I go on to discuss what can be seen to make an atmosphere, a shared way of knowing, specifically pedagogical.",,[],,"[{""id"": 52954, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2021/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 52954, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 52954, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2019/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

Salmon was founded after gold was struck in the nearby mountains, and has seen its fair share of mining boom-and-bust cycles. The recent activity surrounding cobalt mining is routine for this community, yet the social landscape for mining has changed. Mines now face a wide range of environmental and social considerations that add time and cost to operations, while demand increases for critical minerals to advance our technological society. It is a dilemma that takes on an unaccustomed cast when the minerals are those that support a more environmentally sustainable future. These transitions present a series of juxtapositions. Cobalt mining can be environmentally destructive, yet this has to be weighed against the overall good it can do for the environment. Incoming residents looking to be closer to nature place new pressures on infrastructure and the community bonds of rural towns, but then add to the economic and cultural diversity that can help a rural community adapt to a changing world. Such juxtaposition is a reality we must face as we navigate the environmental and social changes that occur as we move toward a more environmentally sustainable future. The story of Salmon is a story of challenges and optimism that mining and social transitions can be done responsibly through the social, environmental, and economic boom-and-busts of the American West.",,[],,"[{""id"": 68826, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 68826, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"
FAR,68827,111636450,111636450,Limits to Collaboration: Field Philosophy Working Lands in the West,2024,Taylor and Francis,,,,"This essay is an example of field philosophy. Field philosophy throws itself into a particular issue or case, rather than merely applying theory or entering with abstract notions of the problem. Field philosophy is practiced in situ - the philosophy is not an abstract dimension of the situation, but is the medium within which the situation occurs. It views philosophy as a lived practice as much as an intellectual endeavor. Reporting on field philosophy will always be understated; the context it is practiced in is too rich - too saturated - to fully recognize in spoken language. My case is livestock grazing on a family ranch in Northeastern Nevada. Through the seven years I’ve been working with the ranch, I’ve come to recognize the role of federal land governance in enacting (always imperfectly) varying conceptions of democracy and the ways that structured epistemic projects serve to curate diverging democratic ideals. This is the medium within which my practice occurs. Here, I report on the ways collaboration is enacted, and how adherence to scientific discipline undermines the collaborative landscape. Along the way, readers will learn a bit about public land management and the deep-seated challenges that must be addressed to develop collaborative public land management that puts the public back into public land.",,[],,"[{""id"": 68827, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 68827, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

FAR,70819,114133843,114133843,Teaching Accessibility Through UX Design,2025,,,,,"UX design infiltrates the practice of technical and professional (TPC) communication because its principles align with the goal of TPC to prioritize the needs of the user. UX goals ask the designer to not only consider if the product is usable but also to consider the experience of that use through innovative thinking (Tham, 2022). This type of design process requires a hyper collaborative relationship with the user and demands the designer relinquish the role of expert to center the user in the design space. Accessibility, the process of ensuring equal access to technologies and information (Oswal, n.d.), aligns with these UX goals. Both UX and accessibility design require the designer to think outside of their own experiences and beyond traditional design, which is why the process begins with empathy. UX invites the designer to emerge in the perspective of the user with a truly open mind attempting to understand how users live in their daily lives (Kelley with Littman, 2005). Using a graduate student technical communication course as a backdrop, this chapter offers methods and benefits for instructors to place UX principles, accessibility practices, and service learning in concert within the technical communication to teach future practitioners the benefit of dispersed power and hyper collaboration. In the course, students are challenged to develop accessible designs with a variety of community partners with disabilities. Students practice user research methods, including interviewing and observation, to understand the access needs these users face in an area of daily living. Students use this data and flexible interaction with their users to inform how they define the need, design the product, and then evaluate, iterate, and implement their designs. As part of this process, students keep reflection journals to capture their own experiences in the UX design space. Students also conference with the instructor at regular intervals. Although there are challenges such as managing community partners, logistics, and scheduling, overwhelmingly, the greatest challenge students encountered was the inability to let go of their own assumptions regarding access solutions and let the user’s experience guide the design process. Students often “solved” the user’s need from their own perspective rather than the lived experience of access for the user. The restructuring of the expert/novice relationship is not an easy transition for students to accomplish in the classroom environment. The dynamics of the classroom typically demand students illustrate their expertise by knowing the “right” method and skill to use to design the “correct” product. The process of centering the user and asking the student to relinquish the role of expert felt disorienting at times. And yet this dynamic, interactive but sometimes uncomfortable relationship is invaluable to accessible, usable designing. In order to facilitate students’ ability to value and practice their dual role of expert and novice requires high-touch guidance from the instructor, which might take the shape of frequent student interviews. The goals of these interactions include students recognizing missteps and forming pathways to revisit their empathy work, which often meant new research, defining, evaluating and iterating. More importantly, these sessions guide students to trust the UX design process and to view accessibility as an experience of the user rather than a list of guidelines. With intentional guidance, students learn UX is not a clean, formulaic process. It is beautifully messy because it engages with the infinite, dynamic diversity of the human experience.",,[],,"[{""id"": 70819, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

FAR,71793,113047992,113047992,Ritual Resistance: Festival Conflicts in Wallonia during the French Revolutionary E ra (1786-1830),2025,Brepols,,,,"Francophone Belgium has a rich tradition of popular festivals dating back to the fourteenth century, including saint military marches, processionals of ‘giants’ (massive puppets), and carnival celebrations. Between 1786-1830, Wallonian communities marginalized by foreign occupation sought to defend and preserve these traditions. Evolving over centuries into elaborate public ceremonies, the religious origins of these festivals were eclipsed in the eighteenth century by secular tropes and enthusiastic popular participation. Emperor Joseph II attempted to regulate festival culture in 1786, a decision that engendered significant resistance and was a leading catalyst for Belgian revolt against Austrian rule during the Brabantine Revolution. In the French Revolutionary era, during which festivals with Catholic origins were banned and replaced with commemorations of the French Republic, the preservation of these folkloric traditions was a focal point for Belgian popular resistance. After Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, the Dutch annexation of Belgian provinces brought still more foreign regulation, continuing the centralized restrictions on festival life that originated during the Austrian and French eras of occupation. Historical research for this period of festival culture in Belgium has not received significant attention beyond isolated studies centered on specific festivals. This chapter analyzes how the proponents of these festivals weathered widespread regulation and outright bans of what were historically liturgical processionals across the Wallonian province of Hainaut, and how what began as religious rituals espoused by ecclesiastical elites became populist symbols of unity and resistance. Popular voices were not often included in the historical record of early modern Belgium and when they appear in archival documents, it is often as protest to elites - either provincial governments or the regency administrators of various foreign occupiers, including Austrians, French, and Dutch. Ultimately, this study centers on how ordinary people in these communities experienced and defended Wallonian festival culture during a critical fifty-year period when regulation and interdiction threatened to destroy traditional celebrations in Hainaut.",,[],,"[{""id"": 71793, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}, {""id"": 71793, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

To assess whether protests have been effective in changing the deployments by the United States, we employ a textual review of available Status of Forces Agreements, a case study of the protest movements in Vieques and Okinawa, and a large observational study of the effect of protests on the concentration of U.S. forces in other countries.

Severe weather, flooding, fires, amplified humidity, increases in energy and utility costs, in addition to the reputational risks of inaction and the resulting negative impacts on communities, all constitute direct and indirect forms of risk. Consequently, in addition to educating and inspiring visitors toward a regenerative and equitable future, museums are equally tasked with revising operational planning to meet the ethical expectations of stakeholders and realities of altered ecosystems. These efforts include evaluating and updating internal operations to both mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis, as well as measuring and documenting practices, impacts, and progress. As museums are working to find their place within an increasingly complex climate crisis, both in terms of interpretive responsibilities and operational challenges, many have found the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be a helpful NorthStar in navigating environmental and social impact management. Cultural institutions and the SDGs serve each other reciprocally.

There are more established methods for remediation such as the use of Direct currents (DC) and alternating current (AC) as well as more recent research on the use of electromagnetic fields (Azad et al., 2013, 2015; Farid et al., 2014). The focus of this section is on the use of DC, referred to as electrokinetic remediation. In such method, DC is applied across electrodes inserted into the soil where applying an electric potential, electric current is induced across the electrodes for mobilization and extraction of contaminants. Contaminants can be transported to extraction wells using electroosmosis and ionic migration along with electrolysis causing a series of chemical reactions. In addition to the induced flow of contaminants, electrodeposition and ion exchange (for heavy metals) can be used for heavy metal remediation. A constant electric field of DC can directly move any charged particle and, hence, be used to remediate any material that can be ionized (e.g., inorganics, heavy metals, and ionic radioactive compounds). Such electric field can also indirectly move and remediate noncharged (both polar or nonpolar) material (e.g., organic compounds).",,[],,"[{""id"": 77626, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
