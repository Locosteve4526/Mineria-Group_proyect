        "Description/Abstract": "Archaeological test excavations at the Hemmert site (10-Bl-14) on the north shore of Bear Lake in southeastern Idaho produced a significant collection of fish remains identified as Bonneville cisco (Prosopium gemmiferum). The recovery of over 1100 fish vertebrae indicate the late prehistoric use of fishes at the locale and may represent an instance of winter fishing as described in ethnographic accounts for the area.",
