        "Description/Abstract": "Perinatal depression and anxiety (PDA) affect approximately 20\u00a0% of individuals and are associated with adverse outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and impaired cognitive development of the child. Telehealth may reduce access barriers to needed mental health services. However, lack of disseminated, standardized study protocols aimed at investigating the role of telehealth in reducing PDA symptoms limits the ability to compare findings across studies. The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework and a randomized controlled trial protocol (RCT) for use in future studies.",
