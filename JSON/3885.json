        "Description/Abstract": "This study examines graphing calculator technology availability, characteristics of teachers who use it, teacher attitudes, and how use reflects changes to algebra curriculum and instructional practices. Algebra I and Algebra II teachers in 75 high school and junior high/middle schools in a diverse region of a northwestern state were surveyed. Forty of the 75 schools (53%) returned a total of 109 individual surveys. Results indicated that: (1) While 78% of teachers have some access to the technology, only 28% use it regularly. (2) Statistically significant relationships exist between use and age, years of experience, teaching assignment, and teaching level. (3) Respondents view graphical solution methods as secondary to symbolic methods. (4) Teachers are more receptive to using technology to supplement rather than expand the curriculum.",
