        "Description/Abstract": "Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A Delphi study collects the expertise of global SC academics on the SC\nvulnerabilities and the measures for responding to disruptions, improving resilience, and restoring operations.\nData from three polls are systematically analyzed by content, frequency, and cluster analysis.\nFindings \u2013 The study identifies and ranks ten major issues related to SC vulnerabilities and management\nstrategies for specific SC processes and geographical regions. Detected differences among the considered\ngeographical regions point towards particular challenges and call for specific measures to integrate regional\ncontingencies into SC management. In a regional comparison, China and Iran as well as Africa clearly stand out,\nbut also Europe/North America, India/Pakistan, and Brazil show geographical particularities.\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 The responses are collected against the COVID-19 pandemic, while\nthe findings show differences among the regions thereby arguing for taking regional contingencies into\naccount in managing SCs.\nPractical implications \u2013 SC resilience is a core aim, which was emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nfindings provide insights and challenges that managers would have to meet in the different regions covered.\nOriginality/value \u2013 This paper contributes to existing knowledge on SC risks and SC resilience in context to\nextreme situations. Given that events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, will become more frequent in the future\ndue to climate change and geopolitical tensions, insights into how to manage SCs under extreme conditions and\ninto regional differences are crucial.\nKeywords Supply chain management, Supply risk, Resilience, Global operations management, COVID-19,\nDelphi study\nPaper type Research paper",
