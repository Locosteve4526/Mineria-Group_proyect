        "Description/Abstract": "Successful efforts to extend marriage recognition to same-sex couples have tempted some dispirited well-wishers of traditional marriage, among others, to call for the \u201cprivatization of marriage\u201d by getting the state to adopt a neutral stance toward it. Such a policy would require the government to refrain from promoting and supporting marriage and parenthood, effectively making them merely private choices. This misguided approach subordinates considerations of how best to form self-governing citizens to the new ethic of self-expression, imagining that a responsible citizenry will spontaneously emerge. It also produces a culture increasingly hostile to marriage, ignores the problems posed by the human passions, and indirectly opens the door to intrusive state involvement. By contrast, government support for marriage as traditionally understood nurtures the best possible conditions for human flourishing.",
