        "Description/Abstract": "Little progress has been made toward increasing physical activity (PA) in women. This study aimed to determine if an 8-month theory-based book club intervention (Women Bound to Be Active) was effective in increasing: (a) self-worth, (b) benefits relative to barriers to PA, and (c) PA in women (n=51). Findings suggested a book-club was effective for improving: self-worth, the benefits relative to barriers to PA, and possibly participation in PA. This is an innovative model to help women become more active and learn skills that may enable them to be active on their own long after a PA program has ended.",
