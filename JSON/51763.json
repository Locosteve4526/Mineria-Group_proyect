        "Description/Abstract": "How do conflicts around nature influence our attempts to learn about them? We use a dialogic approach to wrestle with this question drawing from our experience of working with movements against extractivism in Pakistan and Colombia. Resource geographies are constituted by embodied spatial practices, and social movements are rich sites of knowledge creation that can follow alternative epistemologies. Instead of considering social movements as objects of investigation, we focus on our own positionality, the performance of academic learning, and the embodied and performative aspects of these struggles that may contradict and even potentiate our modalities of learning about these conflicts. To do so, we explore action research and radical performance geography as approaches for doing critical resource geographies. This dialogue centers around a set of questions on the ethics, modalities, tools, and outputs of action research that lies at the intersection of political action and investigation.",
