        "Description/Abstract": "There is a critical need for fall-prevention interventions to reach medically underserved, hard-to-reach, rural older adults. The evidence-based Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance (TJQMBB) program reduces falls in older adults. This pre-COVID-19 pandemic study assessed the feasibility and impact of a 16-week tele-TJQMBB intervention in older adults. Instructors led six tele-TJQMBB classes via Zoom for 52 older adults (mean age \u00b1 SD 68.5 \u00b1 7.7\u00a0years) at one academic and four community sites. Nearly all (97%) planned sessions were delivered. Average attendance was 61%. There were no adverse events. Fidelity was fair to good (mean 67%). Forty-one percent of sessions experienced technical disruptions. Participants improved their gait speed, balance, lower-extremity strength, and body mass index. Tele-TJQMBB was feasible with a positive impact on outcomes. This study was the first step toward establishing an additional delivery mode that could potentially expand TJQMBB's reach and maintenance.",
