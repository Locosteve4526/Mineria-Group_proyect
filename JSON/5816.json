        "Description/Abstract": "Picture books are in the midst of a boom in Korea (&quot;Korea&quot; refers to South Korea throughout this article). Raabe (2009) claims &quot;an impressive comeback of Korean illustration has received attention at the national and international level&quot; (p. 58). The growth of picture books in terms of quality and quantity also has created variety in content and genres. The recent efforts of publishers to revive classic poems in the picture book format has enriched and extended their meanings as illustrations often add another layer of interpretation. In this article, we explore this new trend of transforming poems into the picture book format. We explore a wide range of poems that were originally written in various historical eras from the 1920s through the 1990s, but have only recently been illustrated and published by Korean artists.",
