        "Description/Abstract": "Convinced by the literature that they could do better for their clients, in this article the authors describe their efforts to transform a categorically-funded program model at one agency from relying on authority and good intentions to evidence-based practice (EBP). Using a case study approach the authors describe a six-year research effort in which they experienced a modicum of success, including completion of a few projects, followed by paralyzing frustrations that warrant sharing with other social work professionals. Reflecting on their experiences, they posit a few questions about EBP for practitioners and leaders in the profession to contemplate. The authors then offer five pathways for moving the profession closer to making EBP a reality in social work.",
