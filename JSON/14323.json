        "Description/Abstract": "We characterize the spectral content and energy of thunder from storms in the Magdalena Mountains near Socorro, New Mexico during the 2009 and 2011 summer monsoon seasons. In both years we deployed networks of between eight and twenty continuously recording, broadband (0.01 to 500 Hz) acoustic sensors that were complemented by four co-located audio microphones in 2011. Because thunder is generated primarily by rapid heating and shocking of the atmosphere around tortuous and extensive lightning channels, the recorded acoustic signals are widely variable across a network of stations. Additionally, infrasonic components of thunder are generated by charge relaxation and compression within a cloud region. Thunder signals therefore yield important information about both current conveyance in channels and charge mobilization in channels and the surrounding cloud. The spectral content of a recorded signal is influenced by a combination of source spectral characteristics, sensor locations relative to channel structures, and background noise. In order to analyze the influence of these various contributions, we study hundreds of events from two storms occurring in July and August of 2009 and twenty-five more storms occurring between July and early September of 2011. All events have coincident Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data which we use to identify event timing and source locations for improved estimates of source acoustic energy. Our dataset is unprecedented in the number of quality events recorded and the spatial distribution of our sensors, allowing comprehensive assessment of the spectral content of thunder. Our analysis contributes to understanding characteristics of acoustic radiation for various storms and types of lightning events.",
