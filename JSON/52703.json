        "Description/Abstract": "The continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-labeling method has the unique ability to simultaneously provide information about binding affinity (Ka) and physical properties of the membranes upon binding with \u03b1-crystallin. In this method, cholesterol analog spin-label CSL incorporated into the membrane monitors the binding of \u03b1-crystallin to the membrane. Four major eye lens fiber cell plasma membrane phospholipids (PLs), i.e., phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sphingomyelin (SM), were used to make the small unilamellar vesicles of individual (PE*, PS, SM, and PC) and two-component (SM/PE, SM/PS, and SM/PC in 70:30 and 50:50 mol%) PLs mixtures with 1 mol% of CSL. The asterisk (*) represents the presence of 30 mol% of PC. The EPR measurements were performed with varying concentrations of \u03b1-crystallin and a fixed concentration of PLs. The key findings were that the Ka of\n\u03b1-crystallin binding to individual and two-component mixtures of PL membranes followed the trends Ka(PC) &gt; Ka(SM) &gt; Ka(PS) &gt; Ka(PE*) and Ka(SM/PE) &gt; Ka(SM/PS) &gt; Ka(SM/PC), respectively. The decrease in the mobility parameter of the membranes upon binding with \u03b1-crystallin, except for the PE* membrane for which there was no binding of \u03b1-crystallin, represents that the membranes become more immobilized near the headgroup regions of the PLs when more and more \u03b1-crystallin binds to them. The increase in the maximum splitting only for the SM and the SM/PE (70:30 mol%) membranes upon binding with \u03b1-crystallin represents that the PL headgroup regions of these membranes become more ordered when \u03b1-crystallin binds to them. Our data suggest that the PL headgroup's size and charge, hydrogen bonding between headgroups, and PL curvature modulates the hydrophobic interaction between \u03b1-crystallin and the hydrophobic fatty acid core of the membranes.",
