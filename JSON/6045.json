        "Description/Abstract": "We examined the impact of a state mandated K-12 mathematics professional development course on knowledge, self-efficacy and beliefs of nearly 4,000 teachers and administrators. Participants completed the Mathematical Thinking for Instruction course, emphasizing student thinking, problem-solving, and content knowledge specific to mathematics instruction. Inventories utilizing items from the Learning Mathematics for Teaching project (2005) measured changes in participants\u2019 Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT) and an end-of-course self-evaluation enabled analysis of changes in MKT, self-efficacy and beliefs. Statistically significant changes were found in all three variables. This study adds to our understanding of the potential usefulness of mandating professional development as a policy vehicle for influencing educators\u2019 mathematics knowledge and beliefs. ?",
