        "Description/Abstract": "In March 1969 at the first national Chicano Liberation Youth Conference hosted by the Crusade for Justice in Denver, Colorado, a young poet named Alurista read &quot;El Plan Espiritual de Aztl\u00e1n&quot; which forged the ideas of &quot;the bronze continent&quot; and &quot;Aztl\u00e1n&quot; (Anaya and Lomeli 1). This historical document, often deemed a manifesto of Chicanismo, or a militant ethos1, advocated Chicano nationalism and self-determination for Mexican Americans. Today, it continues to be one of the founding plans of the student organization, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n, or MEChA. MEChA, which &quot;has been one of the more important student organizations to address the issue of education&quot; (Vargas 378), focuses on the organizational goals laid out in the plan, including: Unity, Economy, Education, Institutions, Self Defense, and Cultural and Political Liberation. Included in this plan is the idea of &quot;reclaiming the land of their birth,&quot; or the land annexed to the United States in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.",
