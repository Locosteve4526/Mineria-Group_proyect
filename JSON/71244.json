        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Anxiety and depression are the leading causes of global health-related burden and\u00a0 have increased dramatically since the 90s. Delivering mental health care using artifical intelligence (AI) chatbots may be one option for closing the gaps for mental healthcare access. The overall aim of this scoping review was to determine the effects of using AI chatbots for anxiety and depression. PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were searched. When possible, MeSH terms were searched in combination with keywords. A total of\u00a0 5,768 abstracts were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Fifty-four articles were chosen for further review, with a total of 16 articles included in the final analysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;egarding quality assessment, the overall quality of the evidence was lower than expected. Overall, the majority of studies showed positive trends in anxiety, stress, and depression. Overall, using an AI chatbot for anxiety, stress, and depression has some promising effects. However, many of the studies were done using rudimentary versions of AI chatbots. In addition, the sampling bias may have contributed to the promising results. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of AI chatbots, as well as to describe undesirable effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
