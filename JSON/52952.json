        "Description/Abstract": "Using Maya Angelou\u2019s I KnowWhy the Caged Bird Singsas an example, this paper introduces Wilhlem  Dilthey\u2019s  (1833\u20131911)  hermeneutics  and  pedagogical  theory.  Dilthey  saw  biographies (and autobiographies like Angelou\u2019s) as nothing less than \u201cthe highest and most instructive form of the understanding of life.\u201d This, then, serves as the starting point for his hermeneutics or theory of understanding, which distinguishes humanistic understanding from scientific explanation, and sees  any  one  moment  or  word  as  having  meaning  only  in  relationto  a  whole\u2014the  whole  of  a sentence  or  text,  or  the  whole  of  one\u2019s  life.  It  is also  the  starting  point  of  his  pedagogy,  whose ultimate  \u201cduty\u201d  is  \u201cto  develop  the  child  as  a  person  who  carries  their  own  purpose  within themselves.\u201d  In  introducing  Dilthey\u2019s  hermeneutic  pedagogy,  this  paper  draws  principally  from his The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences (1927/2002), a text that has been long neglected in hermeneutic and phenomenological studies of education.",
