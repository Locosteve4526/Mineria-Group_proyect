        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Bovine mastitis, or inflammation of the udder, is the most common and economically significant disease affecting the global dairy industry. The Gram positive bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus, &lt;/em&gt;is a key agent of mastitis and the top cause of subclinical and chronic disease. Developing an effective vaccine against &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; for dairy cattle would reduce antibiotic use, lower treatment costs and positively impact milk production and quality. The goal of these studies was to identify and prioritize &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; vaccine candidates to prevent bovine mastitis. Human and bovine staphylococcal isolates were compared after in vitro growth in skim milk and low iron media. Increased expression of surface adhesins was detected uniquely in bovine-adapted &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; after growth in milk. To identify additional antigens expressed in milk, a combined proteomics and transcriptomics approach was implemented. Surface protein extracts of bovine &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; cultured in nutrient rich broth or skim milk were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify uniquely expressed proteins. RNA was also isolated from cultures under the same conditions and analyzed by next generation RNA sequencing to identify &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; genes upregulated in milk. Candidate antigens were collected and prioritized by subcellular localization to the cell periphery, adhesin or virulence factor probability, absence of homology to mammalian proteins and presence of MHC-I and II epitopes. Twenty-six proteins of interest, including adhesins, toxins, and metal-binding transport proteins, were prioritized and identified as strongly conserved in &lt;em&gt;S. aureus.&lt;/em&gt; These proteins were less conserved, or absent, in other bovine staphylococcal species. Results demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; alters surface and secreted protein expression to adapt to a milk environment, and provide a unique approach to identify mastitis vaccine candidates.&lt;/p&gt;",
