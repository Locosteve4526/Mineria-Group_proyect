        "Description/Abstract": "I will report on two ongoing projects on apolar ideals. In joint work with Max Sullivan, as part of his master\u2019s thesis, we study the apolar ideal of a power of a power sum symmetric polynomial. We determine the initial degree of the ideal in some cases, and conjecture that the result holds in all cases. In joint work with Jaros\u0142aw Buczy\u0144ski and Alexander Woo we study the apolar ideal of a general hyperplane arrangement. Results include a combinatorial description of at least some of the minimal generators.",
