        "Description/Abstract": "In this presentation, Dr. Norm Friesen will trace the transmission of the constellation from the old world to the new, and across three landmark studies in material history. Dr. Friesen will highlight the significance of the image of the constellation in each, showing how it has changed and evolved from its initial conception by Walter Benjamin in Germany to its final reappearance in the Gutenberg Galaxy by McLuhan in Canada. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of the continuing richness and potential of this concept in our own changing and precarious times.",
