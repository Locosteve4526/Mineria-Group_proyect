        "Description/Abstract": "Defining democracy requires some craft. Modern theorists tend to separate along two main fault lines; procedural and substantive considerations. Procedural considerations include free, competitive, and fair elections as a means of holding the government to account, along with the protection by the state (through an enforced constitution) of certain rights and liberties. Among substantive considerations are socially based value judgments such as equitable income distribution.",
