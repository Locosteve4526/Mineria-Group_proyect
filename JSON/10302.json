        "Description/Abstract": "The extracellular Matrix (ECM) has recently been implicated with the regulation of angiogenesis via manipulation of the Notch signaling system however the molecular basis for this has not been explored. We previously showed that the ECM protein microfibril-associated glycoprotein 2 (MAGP2), suppresses Notch signaling in endothelial cells but promotes Notch signaling in non-endothelial cells. The goal of this work was to dissect the molecular mechanism by which MAGP2 manipulates Notch signaling. We found that control of Notch by MAGP2 was not dependent on specific Notch receptor-ligand expression patterns. Interestingly however, we found that mutation of the MAGP2 RGD to a non-integrin binding RGE caused MAGP2 to promote rather than suppress Notch signaling in endothelial cells. Similarly, soluble integrin blocking RGD peptides and ?V?3 blocking antibodies also increased Notch signaling even in the absence of MAGP2. Further mechanistic dissection revealed that inhibitors of SRC and FAK kinases but not other kinases also increased Notch signaling. Interestingly, in addition to intensifying Notch signaling, RGD peptides and SRC inhibitors also triggered an increase in higher mobility NICD western blot bands and extended NICD half-life. Our results suggest that these high mobility NICD bands are non-ubiquitinated forms of NICD fragments. Collectively, we believe these results have revealed a previously undiscovered interaction between integrins and the Notch signaling system that acts to limit Notch signaling via ubiquitination and degradation of active NICD fragments. This novel mechanism may be responsible for ECM control of Notch signaling and angiogenesis.",
