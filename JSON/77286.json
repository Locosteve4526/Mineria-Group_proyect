        "Description/Abstract": "Extreme temperatures and radiation, present in nuclear and space environments, are detrimental to sensor and instrumentation operation vital for maintaining and monitoring safe and efficient working conditions. Temperature in particular is a critical property in assessing overall performance of fuel, structural components, instrumentation and electronics. A Niobium-Molybdenum (Nb-Mo) thermocouple device has been a method of interest for the promising material properties present in Nb and Mo that assist in temperature and radiation resistance. As a continuation of this technology, to increase suitability for spacecraft and in-pile use, a novel printed thermocouple device has been fabricated and tested. The novel high temperature irradiation resistance thermocouple (HTIR-TC) offers manufacture ease and a compact size to minimize sample intrusion and allow design flexibility. Printed thermocouples offer flexibility in materials and design opposed to commercially available thermal sensors. Nb and Mo nanoparticle inks compatible with inkjet and aerosol jet printing technologies were synthesized. Contact angle, rheology studies, and SEM measurements have been conducted to ensure the quality and printability of the ink.",
