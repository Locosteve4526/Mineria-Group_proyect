        "Description/Abstract": "Pedicle screw fixation is a spinal fusion technique that involves the implantation of screws into vertebral pedicles to restrict movement between those vertebrae. The objective of this research is to measure pedicle screw placement accuracy using a novel automated measurement system that directly compares the implanted screw location to the planned target in all three anatomical views. Preoperative CT scans were used to plan the screw trajectories in 122 patients across four surgical centers. Postoperative scans were fused to the preoperative plan to quantify placement accuracy using an automated measurement algorithm. The mean medial-lateral and superior-inferior deviations in the pedicle region for 500 screws were 1.75\u2009\u00b1\u20091.36\u00a0mm and 1.52\u2009\u00b1\u20091.26\u00a0mm, respectively. These deviations were measured using an automated system and were statistically different from manually determined values. The uncertainty associated with the fusion of preoperative to postoperative images was also quantified to better understand the screw-to-plan accuracy results. This study uses a novel automated measurement system to quantify screw placement accuracy as it relates directly to the planned target location, instead of analyzing for breaches of the pedicle, to quantify the validity of using of a robotic-guidance system for accurate pedicle screw placement.",
