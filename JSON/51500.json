        "Description/Abstract": "Visualizing the living genome and the molecular interactions governing gene expression is difficult. Even so, its visualization is critical for understanding gene regulation, transcription, cellular metabolism and human disease. Through using 3D orbital tracking we are able to visualize gene activation by observing the relationship between pre-mRNA synthesis and the protein-DNA binding of the transcription factor Glucocorticoid. In addition to establishing that we can track these molecules of interest, this study also allows us to utilize experimental data to enhance our predictive models of transcriptional regulation and our understanding of the laws governing the genome. The data collected and the models produced expand our knowledge of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation and increase our understanding of  previously unknown details pertaining to transcriptional activation and temporal coordination (Stavreva et al. 2019).
