        "Description/Abstract": "Entomological surveillance has been a component of an ongoing, multi-year study of malaria transmission in a high transmission area of NE Uganda. We report on the seasonal and locational trends among the two primary malarial vectors, taken from 90 sentinel huts in three subcounties of the Katakwi district. Two of three subcounties have received indoor residual spraying (IRS) with pirimiphos methyl, alone or in combination with mass drug administration (MDA). Mosquitoes, in districts with and without these interventions, are gathered monthly with CDC light trap collections and analyzed for gravidity and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tested for sporozoite positivity. Spatial mapping and temporal trends for the surveillance huts, and those village/subcounty-wide are reported. A biannual temporal trend for sequential, coordinated Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae emergence is uncovered from which we infer that each of two annual transmission peaks are largely prompted by only one of the individual species. The impacts of IRS/IRS+MDA are very apparent on the mosquito densities. The spatial transmission environment is variegated at sub-kilometer length scales",
