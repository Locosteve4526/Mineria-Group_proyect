        "Description/Abstract": "Herman Melville\u2019s marked and annotated copy of Thomas Warton\u2019s The History of English Poetry (London: Ward, [1871]) epitomizes the precarious fate of Melville\u2019s library while also illustrating the challenges and importance of his reading and marginalia to ongoing scholarship on his life and writings.  The 1,032-page volume was first discovered by Charles Olson in the 1930s\u2014over four decades after approximately half of Melville\u2019s library was dispersed following his death in 1891\u2014but reported by Olson only to two or three individuals, such as the late Merton M. Sealts, author and compiler of Melville\u2019s Reading, who tried but failed to relocate the book. It was finally rediscovered in 1999 by myself and Dennis C. Marnon in a restricted stack area of the Brooklyn Public Library, where it had been unlisted in the library\u2019s catalogue throughout the decades following Olson\u2019s research. Twice rebound and missing its original endpapers (and therefore, most likely, Melville's usual ownership inscription), the extremely brittle volume has since been purchased and digitized by Houghton Library, and an edited photographic version is in progress at Melville\u2019s Marginalia Online. Documentation of Melville\u2019s marginalia is complicated at numerous points in the volume by markings in the hand of at least one subsequent owner, and the proposed paper will demonstrate procedures of attribution while it also explores Melville\u2019s engagement with Warton\u2019s text. Along with following the historian\u2019s account of English literature from Norman-Saxon verse to the poetry of the Reformation, Melville\u2019s verifiable markings and annotations reveal his preoccupation with Warton\u2019s attention to subjects \u201calmost unknown to the general reader,\u201d to quote from one scored passage. His marginalia gravitate uncannily to Warton\u2019s discussions of lost works, dispersals of libraries, works rescued from oblivion, languages and writings concealed by ecclesiastical dictates, banned writings, and esoteric modes of literary expression\u2014all topics with deep aesthetic and biographical connections to Melville's own writings and to his failed career as a popular author. The book also contains marginalia on writers Melville had already studied in still-surviving volumes, such as his copies of Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton, whose works had profoundly influenced his own writings, as well as unique marginalia on now-forgotten writers excerpted by Warton, and by whom no works owned by Melville are known to survive. Dating deep within the period of reputational decline that followed his failure as a marketable writer, when he drew heavily upon works of poetry and criticism while quietly pursuing his own sophisticated efforts in verse, Melville\u2019s marginalia in Warton\u2019s History of English Poetry post-date his publication of Battle-Pieces (1866) and precede the publication of his epic poem Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land (1876), offering an unparalleled look into a notoriously obscure but artistically fertile period of his life and thought.
