        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a survey of mathematics instructional practice and provide initial  validation of the theoretical and psychometric properties of the instrument. The participants for this study were inservice teachers and administrators enrolled in a state-mandated three credit mathematics professional development course during spring and summer 2013. Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the factor structure. Results identified a two factor structure of behaviorist and social-constructivist based instructional practices. Analyses revealed that while distinct, these two perspectives of instructional practice were only weakly related prior to the course (r= -.11) and not significantly correlated at the conclusion of the course. In addition, t-tests of participants\u2019 instructional practice prior to and after the course indicate significant differences, demonstrating the potential for the survey items to capture change in instructional practice as a result of professional development.  Initial validation efforts indicate the survey items hold promise for examining instructional practice on a large-scale. ",
