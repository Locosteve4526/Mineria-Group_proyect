(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-dark-side-of-equality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-dark-side-of-equality&lt;/a&gt;) In it, I update the theory I presented in my 2021 book active-passivism to become engaged-indifference. I show how Christian reasoning allows believers to tackle difficult issues in ways that allow them to seem both engaged and aware, while also denying any real responsibility or appetite for change.\u00a0\u00a0",
