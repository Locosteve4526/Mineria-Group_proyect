        "Description/Abstract": "A once strict tax deadline has been relaxed by recent litigation: the statutory deadline to file a petition with the U.S. Tax Court. Long considered jurisdictional, the petition deadlines are increasingly being interpreted as nonjurisdictional\u2014allowing taxpayers to argue their lateness can be forgiven by equitable tolling. The purpose of this research project is to develop guidelines the Tax Court should use to determine which excuses for late filing are worthy of equitable tolling. In doing so, we look to equitable principles used elsewhere in the tax law and beyond.",
