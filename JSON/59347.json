        "Description/Abstract": "Background:\nDeclines in malaria burden in Uganda have slowed recently; control resources\nneed to be optimized to reduce malaria in high transmission areas. Modelling\npredicts that indoor residual spraying (IRS) and mass drug administration\n(MDA), when co-timed, have a synergistic impact that extends the duration of\nMDA, a benefit that increases with transmission intensity. This study was\ndesigned to quantify the additional impact of population-based MDA, if any,\nwhen added to IRS, as compared with IRS alone and with standard of care.\nMethods:\nThe 32-month prospective controlled community trial enrolled an open cohort\nof residents (46,767 individuals at 1st enumeration and 52,133 at 4th\nenumeration) in Toroma County, Katakwi District in northeastern Uganda. Study\nparticipants were enumerated, consented, and assigned to three arms based on\nsubcounty of residence: IRS+MDA, IRS, and standard of care (which included\ninsecticide treated bednets and case management). The sub-county with the\nhighest number of clinical cases in the previous year was assigned to IRS+MDA,\nwith the other subcounties assigned randomly. IRS with pirimiphos methyl\n(Actellic) and MDA with dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine (DP/Eurartesim) were\ndelivered in 4 co-timed campaign-style rounds 8 months apart. The primary\nendpoint was population prevalence of malaria, estimated by 6 cross-sectional\nsurveys at baseline and then following each round.\nResults:\nComparing malaria prevalence by qPCR in MDA+IRS and IRS only arms over\nall 6 surveys (intention-to-treat analysis), roughly every 6 months,\npost-interventions, we found using a geostatistical model a significant additional\n15.5% (95% CI: [13.7%, 17.5%], Z=9.6, p= 5e-20) decrease in the adjusted\nodds ratio (aOR) due to MDA for all ages, a 13.3% reduction in under 5\u2019s (95%\nCI: [10.5%, 16.8%], Z=4.02, p= 5e-5), and a 10.1% reduction in children 5-15\n(95% CI: [8.5%, 11.8%], Z=4.7, p= 2e-5). There was an overall 80.1% reduction\n(95% CI: [80.0%,83.0%, p\u00a1.0001] in odds of qPCR confirmed malaria for all ages\nresidents of the MDA+IRS arm compared to the standard of care (SoC) arm.\nSecondary difference-in-difference analyses comparing surveys at different\ntimepoints to baseline showed aOR (MDA + IRS vs IRS) of qPCR positivity\nbetween 0.28 and 0.66 (p\u00a10.0001). There were three serious adverse events, one\nof which (nonfatal) was considered related to study medications. Limitations\ninclude the initial non-random assignment of IRS+MDA, which may have\nunderstated the impact of MDA, and equipoise considerations which ruled out an\nMDA-only arm.\nConclusions:\nThis study assessed the additional population impact of population-based MDA\nadded to IRS, as compared with IRS alone and with standard of care, in a high\nburden region of Uganda. Despite being assessed at long timepoints, adding\nMDA to IRS showed significant differential impact on population prevalence over\nIRS alone. Future research should include cohort studies of incidence following\nthe intervention.",
