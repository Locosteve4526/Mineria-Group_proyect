        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Reducing health disparities is a national research priority, and health leadership groups have identified a need for an increased number of culturally competent nurses (Amaro et al., 2006; IOM, 2011). Previous research shows that providers who identify as a minority are more likely to practice in underserved areas with minority populations, which leads to more effective, culturally-competent care (Davis et al., 2010; Ferrell et al.. 2016). However, little has been documented in the literature regarding the experiences of culturally diverse nursing students. As the demographics of patients in the U.S. change to include higher numbers of minorities, it is important to increase the diversity of the nurses caring for them (Ferrell &amp; DeCrane, 2016). Gaining insight into the specific stressors that contribute to attrition will help nursing faculty and administrators understand how to best support and retain minority nursing students (Harris et al., 2014), specifically Latinx students, as they are the fastest growing minority group (Anderson &amp; Shapiro, 2011). This is significant as the absence of culturally diverse students in nursing programs leads directly to a lack of qualified culturally diverse practicing nurses.&lt;/p&gt;",
