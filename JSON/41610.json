        "Description/Abstract": "It seems like everyone has a great idea these days, but understanding whether that idea qualifies for intellectual property protection can be overwhelming. Can I patent this? How do I trademark my logo? Can I copyright and patent something? Questions like these can be daunting for any librarian, especially when the lines between reference and legal advice start to blur. In this session we will outline the basics of different types of intellectual property and available Idaho resources for those who wish to know more. We will cover the issue of disclosure, why prior art searching matters, and avoiding inventor scams. Bring real patron questions to share!",
