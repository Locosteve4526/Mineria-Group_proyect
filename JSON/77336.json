        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;A variable-cost usage fee that is charged for a fixed-cost resource can affect feelings of fairness, which in turn can affect tendency to use or misuse that resource. We find evidence of this phenomenon with archival data and a behavioral experiment. This study contributes to accounting research and practice by providing evidence about the importance of discerning between variable and fixed cost and about charging fees for resources that match the cost behavior of those resources. This study also demonstrates how overhead cost allocation can lead to poor outcomes when cost drivers are not selected carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
