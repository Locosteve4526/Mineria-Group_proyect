        "Description/Abstract": "Relationships between the Barron revised Ego-Strength (Es) Scaleand selected validity scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Invertory-2(MMPI-2) were examined in terms of zero-order correlations, multiple partial correlations, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis. The participants were 259 individuals from a state correctional system. The fundamental aim was to ascertain whether or not low scores on the Es represent a hypothesized test taking style related to faking bad. The data yielded support for this notion and also suggested that higher Es scores may relate to social desirability or fake good responding.",
