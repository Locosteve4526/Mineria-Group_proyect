        "Description/Abstract": "Participants will review and experience curriculum materials designed to engage teacher candidates in repeated cycles of student artifact analysis. Artifacts include video and written evidence of K-12 students working on non-standard tasks in mathematics and the sciences. Small and whole-group discussion will focus on 1) how engaging in repeated cycles of artifact analysis can reveal characteristics of pedagogical humility and 2) the role of pedagogical humility with respect to responsive teaching practices and to creating an equitable, inclusive classroom. We will then collectively brainstorm ways to cultivate pedagogical humility across the STEM teaching disciplines.",
