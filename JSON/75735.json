        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;This presentation featured two Boise State University faculty librarians who are engaged in directly teaching students to critically engage with artificial intelligence (AI). While many librarians are engaging with AI, and even teaching about it, Boise State librarians are leading the way on their campus by 1) creating a for-credit information literacy and AI course, 2) integrating AI literacy into the general education curriculum, and 3) developing an asynchronous course with campus partners that is available to the entire campus. Presenters discussed strategies for using information literacy principles to critically and ethically engage with generative AI in higher education.&lt;/span&gt;",
