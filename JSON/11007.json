        "Description/Abstract": "On occasion of his first lecture tour of India in 2010, Zizek sparked off a debate with Nivedita Menon, a leading postcolonial feminist scholar. The debate rivets around Menon\u2019s contention that Zizek\u2019s emphasis on European, Christian Universalism as the most proactive model for countering capitalism is ignorant of the heteroglossiac postcolonial histories of South Asia. Menon\u2019s deconstructive response (\u2018The Two Zizeks\u2019) to Zizek\u2019s lecture \u2018Tragedy and Farce,\u2019 and her later interpolations (in Kafila), suggest that what Zizek appears to be missing is a knowledge of the fallibility of Eurocentric discourses in negotiating the colonial and postcolonial situations particular to the subcontinent. Though Zizek\u2019s debates with Badiou and Butler are well known few outside of India are aware of the Menon-Zizek debate. This paper will occasion this little known debate to consider some of the major points raised by Menon against the applicability of Zizek\u2019s theoretical arguments toward reading and understanding South Asian politics and culture.",
