        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Childhood sexual abuse represents a significant public health concern, particularly within minority populations, where adversities and complications are prevalent but understudied. This study aims to investigate the mental health of Asian American childhood sexual abuse survivors and explore the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse among Asian adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;A secondary analysis of the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data was conducted, including a final sample of 1,894 Asian adults (0.16% of the total sample size of\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;= 401,958). Among these participants, 16.8% (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0= 1,894) reported experiencing CSA. The most common forms of abuse were inappropriate touching (11.8%,\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0= 224), being forced to touch someone inappropriately (7.2%,\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0= 136), and being forced to have sex (4%,\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0= 76). Regression analysis revealed that CSA was significantly associated with lower education levels (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;OR&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;= 1.32) and higher income (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0= 1.79), suggesting socioeconomic factors play a role in CSA reporting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within Asian American communities, childhood sexual abuse remains a taboo topic, leading to a reluctance among adults to engage in sexual health research. This brief report highlights the dearth of research and the stigma surrounding discussions of sexual abuse among Asian American adults. There is a critical need for early intervention programs that focus on the mental health of childhood sexual abuse survivors, particularly within minority communities such as Asian Americans. Addressing this issue can support those affected and help reduce the disparities minority populations face.&lt;/span&gt;",
