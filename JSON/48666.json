        "Description/Abstract": "In this Research to Practice paper, we present a sustainable model for teaching training in Computer Science. To address issues related to self-ef\ufb01cacy and teacher preparation, we started a formal program (IDoCode) that not only provides teacher training through the academic year, but also provides teachers the opportunity to obtain a Masters in STEM Education degree or a Graduate Certi\ufb01cate in Computer Science Teacher Endorsement. \n\nThrough our program, we have shown that teachers feel more con\ufb01dent in their ability to teach computer science courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and the Java-based AP CS A, as well as leading the students in a capstone project. In this paper, we present a sustainable approach to make a cultural change in the landscape of Computer Science education in the state of Idaho. We discuss various factors including working with the State Board of Education, local software companies, the university, and other invested partners to help CS courses in high school count towards graduation. We have also been active with respect to community engagement by organizing an annual meeting with counselors and principals to encourage women and minorities to take computer science courses and conducting summer professional development workshops for new teachers.
