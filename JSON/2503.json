        "Description/Abstract": "The molecular basis for the cellular interaction of DNA and nucleosomes and the physiological consequences of this binding were examined. Both DNA and nucleosomes were demonstrated to bind specifically to the surface of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the murine T cell line S49. Western blots of S49 cell membranes, using probes of biotin-labeled DNA and nucleosomes, showed reactivity at 29 and 69 kDa. Functionally, the interaction of DNA and nucleosomes with murine spleen cells stimulated the release of significant amounts of IL-6 activity. There is evidence that nucleosomes, a product of apoptosis, are the major component of circulating DNA found in the plasma of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The interaction of nucleosomes with cell-surface DNA binding molecules may have physiological relevance to some of the immune aberrations observed in patients with SLE.",
