        "Description/Abstract": "Facilitation of knowledge and meaning construction can be challenging in nursing preceptorship courses due to the logistics of student placements and variety of clinical times. Although post-conferences have long been the strategy used to provide for knowledge and meaning construction, these often are not manageable in preceptorship courses. To provide for narrative experience sharing and knowledge construction, blogging was employed as an innovative teaching strategy in a preceptorship course offered during the last semester of an associate degree nursing program. The use of blogging was expected to provide an avenue for facilitated meaning construction, self-reflection, and social support (Kerawalla, Minocha, Kirkup, &amp; Conole, 2009).\n\n",
