        "Description/Abstract": "We adapted the Information Gain (IG) analysis procedures described by Honts and Schweinle (2009) to the Relevant \u2013 Irrelevant technique (RIT) using data from Krapohl &amp; Rosales (2014). The RIT is used in a number of screening settings, including public safety applicant screening and security screening for U.S. Federal employees (Honts &amp; Amato, 2007). IG provides an index of the increase in information gained by using a test result over predicting the base rate of the target event. We found that deceptive outcomes from the RIT examinations in Krapohl &amp; Rosales (2013) failed to provide a significant increase in IG over unassisted professional lie catchers across the complete range of base rates of deception. For truthful outcomes IG peaked at 0.268 at a base rate of deception of 0.63. For truthful results, there was a significant (1-tailed, p &lt; .05) increase in IG over unassisted professionals for base rates ranging from 0.12 through 0.98 inclusive. In comparison to available alternatives, such as the Directed Lie Screening Test (Handler, Honts, &amp; Nelson, 2013), the RIT provides markedly inferior performance across the range of base rates with both truthful and deceptive outcomes.",
