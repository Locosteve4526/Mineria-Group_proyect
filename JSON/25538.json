        "Description/Abstract": "We present experimental evidence that trapping mechanisms contributing  to the negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) of high-k dielectric  p-channel metal oxide semiconductor (pMOS) transistors are thermally  activated. Device behavior during stress and recovery from 300 K down to  6 K indicate the dominance of the hole trapping mechanism commonly  attributed to NBTI is reduced as temperature decreases. Further, trends  in the temperature dependence of drain current shifts suggest more than  one mechanism is responsible for NBTI. Specifically, below 240 K,  current degradation immediately following stress is no longer observed.  In fact, the opposite effect occurs, which is suggestive of electron  trapping as the dominant mechanism at such temperatures.",
