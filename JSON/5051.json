        "Description/Abstract": "An unusual copper(II) complex [Cu(L1a)2Cl2] CH3OH\u00b7H2O\u00b7H3O+Cl? (1a) was isolated from a solution of a novel tricopper(II) complex [Cu3(HL1)Cl2]Cl3\u00b72H2O (1) in methanol, where L1a is 3-(2-pyridyl)triazolo[1,5-a]-pyridine,  and characterized with single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The  tricopper(II) complex of potential ligand 1,5-bis(di-2-pyridyl ketone)  carbohydrazone (H2L1) was synthesized and physico-chemically characterized, while the formation of the complex 1a was followed by time-dependant monitoring of the UV\u2013visible spectra,  which reveals degradation of ligand backbone as intensity loss of bands  corresponding to O ? Cu(II) charge transfer.",
