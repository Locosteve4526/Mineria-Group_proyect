        "Description/Abstract": "The physical form of the book known as the codex has been described as nothing less than \u201cthe most powerful object of our time,\u201d as the \u201cconcrete form\u201d of \u201cthe Western episteme.\u201d The book, in other words, is an epochally and epistemologically foundational medium. The book\u2019s physical nature, its typical contents, the habits and practices associated with its use, and the way that these are acquired, can thus be said to together constitute the paradigm for knowing. This article begins with an examination of book culture\u2014one which provides long-familiar demarcations of knowledge and ignorance, development and depravation that are starting to lose their force. Appealing to the notion of the longue dur\u00e9e, this paper thenturns to the history and contemporaneity ofthe book in educational discourse. In concluding, itconsiders what the changing educational significance of the book can tell us about change in education itself, and what this ongoing change might mean for us today.",
