        "Description/Abstract": "Modeling Ice-Ocean Interactions with NUMO.\n\nIce-sheet/ocean interaction in Greenland is one of the key outstanding challenges in climate modeling, yet present-day climate models are not able to resolve fine-scale processes in the fjords.\u00a0This is due to orders of magnitude difference in spatial scales between the open ocean (~1000km) and fjord (&lt;1km) as well as small-scale processes at the glacier terminus (~1m), complicated\u00a0bathymetry and coastline. The most recent computational studies of fjord circulation focused on simplified box-like domains (e.g., Slater et al., 2015).\n\nWe develop the Non-hydrostatic Unified Model of the Ocean (NUMO) to provide the scientific community with a tool capable of simulating ocean circulation in Greenland fjords while accounting for the complex domain geometry and the range of scales. The model uses fully three-dimensional unstructured mesh and high-order element-based Galerkin method to discretize the Boussinesq approximation of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A vital aspect of the model is the ability to capture the ice/ocean interface with high-resolution mesh while keeping the remainder of the domain relatively coarse. At the ice/ocean boundary, we model melting by solving three fundamental equations (Hellmer and Olbers, 1989; Holland and Jenkins, 1999) representing freezing-point of seawater dependence of salinity and pressure, and balance of heat and salinity fluxes.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss the validation of the model on a range of test cases with increasing complexity and present recent developments and challenges. Those include streamlined modeling process from GIS bathymetry information, through 3D geometry modeling, meshing, and simulations.\n\nReferences:\n\nHellmer, H.H., and D. Olbers. 1989.
