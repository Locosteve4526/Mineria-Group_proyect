        "Description/Abstract": "Art educators John Derby and Kathleen Keys discuss storied outsider artist James Castle in \u201cJames Castle: Deaf, Dumb, and Maligned.\u201d Like many outsider artists, Castle was disabled, in his case by virtue of hearing impairment, lack of education and literacy, speech impairment, socioeconomic status, social mannerisms, and perhaps autism. He was also self-taught and highly prolific. Unlike most outsider artists, Castle demonstrated sophisticated artistic practices that were consistent with those of professional artists in terms of depth and breadth, with multiple cohesive bodies of work. In addition to his unusual penchant for creativity, in which he produced his own materials, techniques, and styles, Castle utilized curatorial practices to exhibit, protect, and hide his work, amid resistance to his work by family members and exploitation by art dealers and other professionals.",
