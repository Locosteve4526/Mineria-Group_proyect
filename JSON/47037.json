        "Description/Abstract": "As a means of departure, this paper will begin by considering two short stories by Yanick Lahens and \u00c9velyne Trouillot (\u201cLe Jour f\u00eal\u00e9\u201d and \u201cLe D\u00e9tour,\u201d respectively), both of which are limited in terms of setting and time of narration to a protagonist\u2019s experience behind the wheel of her car in Port-au-Prince.  A brief examination of these texts will serve to demonstrate how, in each story, being in a car represents not only a source of physical comfort and desired isolation from others but furthermore entails a socio-economic, class-based distinction that ultimately calls unwanted attention to the drivers of both vehicles.  Indeed, for Trouillot\u2019s protagonist who inadvertently drives her sparkling blue Honda down the wrong street, \u201cil \u00e9tait trop tard pour faire marche arri\u00e8re.\u201d  In both stories, the prime advantage afforded by cars\u2014namely, the ability to get around quickly and concisely\u2014essentially backfires when this supposed ease of movement puts the women in undesired circumstances.  In the spirit of this year\u2019s conference theme of rasanblaj, the theoretical framework I propose to employ in turning to two novels by the same writers, Lahens\u2019s Douces D\u00e9routes (2018) and Trouillot\u2019s Le Rond-point (2015), will be situated at the by and large unexplored intersection of popular culture and postcolonial studies.  In both novels, the function, status and commercial appeal of cars will be read critically as a means of understanding both the driving forces\u2014social, racial, economic and political\u2014behind the struggles for and obstacles to upward mobility in Haiti today, and the frustrated and often unexpected collisions that result within and between communities when individuals find themselves veering (almost) uncontrollably into one another\u2019s paths.",
