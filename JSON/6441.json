        "Description/Abstract": "The article discusses the importance of inquiry in teaching students. It  states that inquiry encourages engagement, literacy, and deep learning  for all students, particularly the reluctant ones. Inquiry is especially  a democratic form of teaching and learning that favors preexisting  interests, unique point of views and several strengths of students who  are typically marginalized in school. Inquiry meets the need of all  students because it makes the function of learning denotative and  permits students to accomplish visible signs of competence. Inquiry is  highly motivating for students and teachers, since it creates and  support democratic classroom environment. It adds that through inquiry,  students are motivated to engage in classroom discussions.?",
