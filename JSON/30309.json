        "Description/Abstract": "David Gabbard, a professor of education, engages Antonio Garcia, a junior independent scholar, in an interview capturing the breath and depth of the development of each other\u2019s work. In particular, Gabbard explores the growing popularity and intrigue around Garcia\u2019s work in education, as it is highly informed by his work in \u017di\u017eek studies. Garcia has never held a tenure position; however, his reputation in and outside of education is acknowledged by his command of high theory and intimate collegiality supporting students and colleagues around the world. Gabbard has been working with Garcia for nearly a year intensely engaged in exploring the fantasies of education predicated on psychoanalytic theory and ideological analysis, the curious question of critical education paradoxical problems, and Garcia\u2019s development of Constellar Theory as a new social model for understanding multiculturalism, social ideology, and political discontent. Garcia\u2019s development of Constellar Theory complements Gabbard\u2019s current interest in Big History.",
