        "Description/Abstract": "Attention is becoming scarce in the information economy. Multitasking, or engaging in multiple goal-independent tasks, is a common remedy used to cope with the information glut. However, while multitasking is inherently cognitively complex, assessing the veracity of the information being processed while multitasking increases task complexity. Research at the confluence of multitasking and deception detection performance is meager and the work that has been done has found contradicting results. We review the relevant multitasking and deception detection literature and specify two competing hypotheses about the effect of multitasking on deception detection accuracy. A laboratory study was conducted with 129 participants in which StrikeCOM was used as the experimental task to elicit both deception and multitasking behaviors. Our results indicate that deception detection performance improved for multitaskers; we comment on this finding and outline areas for future research.",
