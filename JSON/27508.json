        "Description/Abstract": "The possibility that intelligence is correlated with criminal behavior has had a long and checkered history in the social sciences.  Intelligence is such a quintessential human characteristic that we should not be surprised to find it underlying all sorts of behavior.  Could this include behavior that violates the law?  It is understandable that people would avoid adding insult to injury by attributing low intelligence to those who have been snared by the criminal justice system, often for doing things that many of the rest of us did without getting caught.",
