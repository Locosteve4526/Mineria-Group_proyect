        "Description/Abstract": "A concerted effort has been made to increase the opportunities for  undergraduate students to address scientific problems employing the  processes used by practicing chemists. As part of this effort, an  infrared (IR) spectroscopy and molecular modeling experiment was  developed for the first-year general chemistry laboratory course. In the  experiment, students explore the dynamic nature of the covalent bond in  a hands-on, inquiry-based approach by experimenting with mass and  spring systems, using molecular modeling software, and performing IR  spectroscopy on a series of structurally related compounds. Students see  the effect of bond order, atomic size, and molecular weight on bond  strength, bond length, and vibrational frequency. As an added benefit,  students are introduced to scientific instrumentation and tools that can  then be expanded upon in later laboratory classes.",
