        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract We analyze the representation of binary relations in general, and in particular\nof functions and of total antisymmetric relations, in monadic third order logic,\nthat is, the simple typed theory of sets with three types. We show that there is no\ngeneral representation of functions or of total antisymmetric relations in this theory.\nWe present partial representations of functions and of total antisymmetric relations\nwhich work for large classes of these relations, and show that there is an adequate\nrepresentation of cardinality in this theory (a result already shown in a somewhat\ndifferent way by Henrard in unpublished work, but our approach differs from his in\nproviding representations of bijections between sets in a stronger sense). The relation\nof our work to similar work by Henrard (to whom we are indebted) and Allen\nHazen (who arrived at related results independently) is discussed. This work can be\nunderstood as part of a program of assessing the capabilities of (relatively) weak logical\nframeworks: our results are applicable for example, to the framework in David\nLewis\u2019s Parts of Classes.\nKeywords Type theory \u00b7 Higher order logic \u00b7 Third-order logic \u00b7 Binary relations",
