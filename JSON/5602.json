        "Description/Abstract": "Helping professionals, like the rest of the general population, have multiple identities (e.g., parent, community member), and many have prominent role identities as personal and professional caregivers. A recent instrument validation study illustrated that caregiver role identity is related to increased personal distress (e.g., depression, burnout), and this distress can negatively influence practitioners\u2019 professional work. This article builds on this research by expanding  the conceptualization of role identity theory and extending its application to help seeking behaviors among 751 respondents in a representative sample of practicing social workers. Logistic regression analyses of data from this new measure suggest caregiver role identity may be an important risk factor for professionals needing to seek assistance for their own personal problems.",
