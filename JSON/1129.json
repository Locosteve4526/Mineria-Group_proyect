        "Description/Abstract": "Reader's Theatre is a practical application for the English Language Learner (ELL) that is realizing highly successful results when applied strategically to students of all ages. The purpose of Reader's Theatre is to introduce English Language Learners to authentic literature, teach comprehension strategies, and increase fluency. Reader's Theatre will help students understand how to read books at increasing levels of difficulty, and strengthen motivation and confidence. Reader's Theatre is appropriate for students of all ages who are learning a new language and holds positive implications for ELL educators. There are numerous resource books available containing plays and readings for each grade level, content area, or genre. Free resources are available on the internet, as well as suggested methods for Reader's Theatre activities. ELL teachers can also create their own plays from the stories that their students are reading, and more advanced students can incorporate writing strategies in order to write and perform their own plays.",
