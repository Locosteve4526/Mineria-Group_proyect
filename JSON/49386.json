        "Description/Abstract": "How do citizens within countries hosting U.S. military personnel view that presence, and how do these views vary across space within the host country? Using new cross-national survey data from 14 countries, we examine the spatial variation of attitudes toward the U.S. military presence, which has been severely underexplored. Both the positive and negative externalities of hosting U.S. military forces are unevenly distributed across each host country. The country as a whole receives the general public goods of alliance ties with the U.S. and increased security from foreign threats, but areas surrounding U.S. bases receive far more economic benefits and interact more personally with U.S. military forces. However, they are also on the receiving end of negative externalities, from low-level nuisances like increased noise from military equipment to more serious issues like crimes committed by U.S. personnel against local civilians. We use this novel data to test the spatial variation of public opinion toward the U.S. military presence. This study has important implications for the role of U.S. forces in the politics of local communities in host nations and the effect these forces have on the social fabric in areas surrounding U.S. bases.",
