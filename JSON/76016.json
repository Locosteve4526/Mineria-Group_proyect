        "Description/Abstract": "Despite the ubiquity of multilevel sampling, design, and analysis in mental health implementation trials, few resources are available that provide reference values of design parameters (e.g., effect size, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], and proportion of variance explained by covariates [covariate  ]) needed to accurately determine sample size. The aim of this study was to provide empirical reference values for these parameters by aggregating data on implementation and clinical outcomes from multilevel implementation trials, including cluster randomized trials and individually randomized repeated measures trials, in mental health. The compendium of design parameters presented here represents plausible values that implementation scientists can use to guide sample size calculations for future trials.",
