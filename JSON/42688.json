        "Description/Abstract": "This article provides a historical and thematic overview of the most important contributions to phenomenology in German and Anglo-American educational studies. In this context, phenomenology is important both as a theoretical tradition and a research method, in both cases directing attention to the experiential, relational and intersubjective dimensions of pedagogy, teaching and learning. In Germany, phenomenology as a method and as a philosophy has aimed at redefining traditional theories of Bildung and education in ways both empirical and theoretical. In Anglo-America, phenomenology has been used primarily as a methodological approach to illuminate lived experience particularly in the caring professions; it has also occasionally provided possibilities for articulating theories of teaching and learning in close relation with concrete practice.
