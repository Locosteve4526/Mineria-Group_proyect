        "Description/Abstract": "Background:\nIndoor residual spraying (IRS) is widely regarded as a desirable, highly\nsuppressive malaria control intervention. In a perennially high-transmission\nsetting of northeastern Uganda, the effects of multiple rounds of a high-coverage\nIRS program with pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic) were measured and assessed.\nMonthly mosquito collections were amassed via CDC light traps placed at 90\nrandomly-selected sentinel households throughout a rural area of \u223c175km2with\n\u223c50,000 residents, the study site of malaria transmission and its control.\nMethods:\nOf three subcounties investigated two received IRS with pirimiphos methyl, and\nmosquitoes in these areas, with and without these interventions, are collected for\na single night at monthly intervals for nearly three years. Seasonal and locational\ntrends of these collections are reported and compared, notably those of the two\nprimary malarial vectors of the area, the An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus.\nThese collections are also tested for sporozoite positivity with enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assays (ELISA).\nResults:\nIn the absence of vector control, mosquito densities are found to rise and fall\nwith the biannual rains of the region, but the primary (March-June) rainfall\nprompts high An gambiae s.l. densities while the secondary (September-October)\nwet season is associated with high An. funestus collections. These\nseasonally-coordinated, sequential density peaks, each dominated by a single\nspecies are observed over all years and regions of the study. Sporozoite positivity\ndetermined from ELISA testing indicates that malaria transmission in the region\ntakes place throughout the year but also alternates between the vectors,\ncoordinated with these seasons and species. A spatially complex picture of these\nmosquito densities is also observed with the two species found to frequently share\nthe same locales but not at the same times of the year, consistent with a\nsympatric, but not syntopic interspecific interaction. The measured impacts of\nhigh-coverage IRS are also very apparent on the mosquito collections, with\npercentage reductions generally 60-80% compared to the neighboring subcounty\nwithout, and An. funestus collections are found to be modestly more impacted by\nthe campaigns than the An. gambiae complex in all cases.\nConclusions:\nThese vector control efforts in Katakwi have been effective in suppressing the\ntwo primary anopheline vectors with seasonally distinct density peaks. In such a\nhigh transmission setting with multiple vectors, they should be seasonally\nperformed and a bespoke strategy of observation combined with species-specific\ncontrol is merited.",
