        "Description/Abstract": "This article explains how one university accountancy program created a podcast, called \u201cJourneys of Accountancy,\u201d to show introductory accounting students, via interviews with accounting professionals, the myriad opportunities that an accounting career has to offer. The goals of the podcast are to dispel stubborn stereotypes about what accountants do, attract more students to major in accounting, and give non-accounting business majors an appreciation for the importance of studying accounting as part of their coursework.",
