        "Description/Abstract": " Slippery and Subversive seeks to highlight artworks which blur the lines between binary concepts of identification through a queer lens. Work selected for this exhibition takes a position of ambiguity, slippage, and deconstruction as an avenue to redefine the relationship between body and object. The collective artists for this project provide a range of histories, categories, systems, and narratives linked by a common interest in adornment, objecthood, and utility. LGBTQ+ artists creating work in adornment, craft, and sculpture that falls within the theme of Slippery and Subversive are encouraged to apply. ",
