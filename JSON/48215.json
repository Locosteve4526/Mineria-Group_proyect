        "Description/Abstract": "Although convergent research demonstrates that well-designed graphics can facilitate readers\u2019 understanding of text, there are select situations where graphics have been shown to have no effect on learners\u2019 overall text comprehension. Therefore, the current meta-analytic study examined 39 experimental studies published between 1985 and 2018 measuring graphics\u2019 effects on readers\u2019 comprehension. We first quantified the overall effect on reading comprehension. Then, we considered interactions with learners\u2019 characteristics, graphic types, and assessment formats. Our analysis revealed that the inclusion of graphics had a moderate overall positive effect (Hedges\u2019s g = 0.39) on students\u2019 reading comprehension, regardless of grade level. Regarding graphic type, we did not find a significant difference among pictures, pictorial diagrams, and flow diagrams. Only when compared to mixed graphics, pictures had a greater effect on comprehension. Additionally, compared with true and false assessments, graphics differentially benefited students\u2019 comprehension on open-ended comprehension assessments and mixed format assessments. Implications for future research are presented.",
