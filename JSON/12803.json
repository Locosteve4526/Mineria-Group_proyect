        "Description/Abstract": "Postoperative pain after a joint replacement is a major concern for the patient and the nurse (Otten &amp; Dunn, 2011).  The use of IV acetaminophen is a relatively new practice for use in pain management for post-surgical patients (Center for Drug Approval and Research, 2010).  Although approved for use, a review of benefits of IV acetaminophen/paracetamol administration compared with oral and rectal use was conducted considering the increased expenditure, often costing the patient and hospital upwards of 60 times the amount of oral acetaminophen, added nursing time and supplies for administration, as well as increased safety concerns with any IV medication (Miller, Lind, &amp; Murrell, 2011). \n\nPurpose: Our research fellowship team posed the following practice question:  As a new therapy, is the use of IV acetaminophen effective for pain management in the surgical patient?\n",
