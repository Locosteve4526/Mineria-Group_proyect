        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC) established a relationship with ENR to provide free subscriptions to students and faculty. This collaboration grew to include the development of the ASC ENR Student Edition published four times a year highlighting case studies. This introductory, pilot study sought to explore student perceptions of experience, engagement, and learning from the case studies. Seventy-six senior construction management students at three universities were assigned case studies specifically related to ongoing learning. Students completed an 18-question Qualtrics survey regarding their experiences. Results indicated strong perceived value by students. 76% of students reported satisfaction with the case studies as part of their learning experience. Additionally, 86% reported strong connection to classroom material. However, the survey highlighted areas for improvement. For example, students cited amplified value of the case study when active discussion was included after students considered the questions. The data pointed toward a need for faculty to be better trained on how best to use case studies in the classroom, as well as the need to include discussion and additional related sources. Overall, the results of this pilot study suggested that the ENR case studies are a valuable tool for students in construction management courses.&lt;/p&gt;",
