        "Description/Abstract": "I examine the effect mass school shootings on property values. Examining five of these shootings that occurred between 2012 and 2016, I assess the impact of school shootings on property values in the surrounding community. A difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, within the hedonic framework, is used to analyze housing values pre/post-shooting in neighborhoods assigned to a school that suffered a shooting. I combine data on every sale from the Zillow Group ZTRAX database, with the National Center for Education Statistics School Attendance Boundary Survey to identify homes assigned to schools that experienced a shooting and homes assigned to adjacent schools. I find evidence of heterogeneous effects across the five communities where the shootings occurred. Average treatment effects within the school attendance zone where a shooting occurred range from zero to eight percent. Models indicate that three of the five shootings resulted in a statistically significant reduction in sales price for homes in the affected school attendance zone (SAZ), with capitalized losses ranging from $8,000 to $26,000 per sale. Furthermore, results are sensitive to how affected areas are spatially defined, suggesting that identification in the difference-in-differences framework requires careful examination of local property markets when defining the sample.",
