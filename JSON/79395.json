        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In 2020, during the COVID shutdown, I was unable to travel to the UK for my usual research on Catholics in the early modern British Isles so I began to explore BSU's SCA for possible research opportunities. I knew former head archivist Alan Virta had created an LGBT Collection, which, given my background in Gender Studies, was an apporpriate starting place. I found a collection of oral histories collected by BSU students in 2011, directed by Dr. Riley Caldwell-O'Keefe, archived at BSU's Special Collections and Archive (SCA) entitled the &quot;Idaho LGBTQ Oral History Project.&quot; I decided to begin a second archival collection. After familiarizing myself with Virta's collection materials and Caldwell-O'Keefe's students' oral histories, my first graduate student assistant, Rachel Taylor, and I took our first oral history in 2021. I have been taking oral histories and adding them to the SCA in a new archival collection ever since. I have included undergraduate and graduate student researchers every semester, and three have given regional and national conference presentations, media presentations, Public History presentations, or been invited to conduct targeted research by Idaho LGBTQ organizations on the materials since 2022. We currently have over twice as many oral histories ready to be posted to the archive, but understaffing at BSU library/ScholarWorks has delayed posting of almost a dozen.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;",
