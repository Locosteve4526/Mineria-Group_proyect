        "Description/Abstract": "Researchers have sought to both refine and operationalize the central constructs of the Community of Inquiry framework \u2013specifically, cognitive, social and teaching presence\u2013 in a number of ways. In early work, this tended to be done through the analysis of transcripts of online discussions, and the categorization of communicative content as social, cognitive or pedagogical/instructional, or as triggering, exploratory, integrative and/or mutually confirming. Augmented by the \u201cCommunity of Inquiry Survey\u201d and a number of other adaptations of the model to synchronous, non-textual and other instructional contexts, the three types of \u201cpresence\u201d remain a central concern to this day. \r\nExplanation of Other:  Special Journal Issue",
