        "Description/Abstract": "We introduce relative versions of diagrammatic reducibility (DR) and vertex\nasphericity (VA). The definition of diagrammatic reducibility of a 2-complex\ngoes back to Sieradski 1983 who developed it as a tool for detecting\nasphericity of a 2-complex. We characterize relative DR in terms of finite\nsubcomplexes of the universal covering analogous to such a characterization of\nCorson and Trace in the non-relative case and compare relative DR and VA with\nexisting notions of relative asphericity that are in the literature. We present\ntests for relative DR and DA and apply them to LOT-complexes. We give a simpler\nproof for the asphericity of injective LOTs, a result obtained by the authors\nin 2017, using a relative weight test.\n[Journal_ref: ]",
