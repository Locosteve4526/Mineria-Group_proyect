        "Description/Abstract": "At Boise State University, a strong collaborative relationship exists between the School of Social Work (which we will refer to as the School) and the campuswide Service-Learning Program (Boise State SLP). We maximize this relationship by incorporating a service-learning component into our &quot;Introduction to Social Welfare&quot; course. This chapter describes the nuts and bolts of how we integrate service learning into this course and how this course fits into the overall mission of the university. In addition, we provide a brief evaluation of how the service-learning experience impacts student learning, community agencies, and the overall quality of the course.",
