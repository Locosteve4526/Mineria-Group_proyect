        "Description/Abstract": "Pinyon\u2013juniper woodlands are dry ecosystems defined by the presence of juniper (Juniperus\u00a0spp.) and pinyon pine (Pinus spp.), which stretch over 400 000 km2 across 10 US states. Certain\u00a0areas have become unnaturally dense and have moved into former shrub and grasslands, while\u00a0others have experienced widespread mortality. To properly manage these woodlands, sites must\u00a0be evaluated individually and decisions made based on scientific information that is often not\u00a0available. Many species utilize pinyon\u2013juniper woodlands, including the pinyon jay\u00a0(Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), named for its mutualism with pinyon pine, whose population\u00a0has declined by c. 2.2% per year from 1966 to 2022, an overall decrease of c. 71%. To increase the\u00a0likelihood of further research progress, we propose a tool to model the distribution of pinyon\u00a0pine at a finer scale than current woodland classification tools in the northern US Great Basin: a&lt;br&gt;random forest model using geographical, ecological and climate variables. Our results achieved\u00a0an accuracy of 93.94%, indicating high predictive power to identify locations of pinyon pine in\u00a0north-eastern Nevada, the south-eastern corner of Oregon and southern Idaho. These findings\u00a0can inform managers and planners researching pinyon pine, pinyon\u2013juniper woodlands and\u00a0potentially the pinyon jay.",
