        "Description/Abstract": "Volcanoes produce prodigious infrasound, which is sound below the threshold (20 Hz) of human audibility.  This talk explains how studies of volcano infrasound are effective for illuminating dynamic processes of eruptions.  Notably, certain volcanoes which erupt with high intensity infrasounds, are not especially explosive while other volcanoes with spectacular eruptions are relatively quiet.  Volcanoes focused on in this presentation include Erebus (Antarctica), Tungurahua (Ecuador), Santiaguito (Guatemala), and Villarrica (Chile).",
