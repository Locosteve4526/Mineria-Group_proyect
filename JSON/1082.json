        "Description/Abstract": "Data on ebooks is beginning to show that this format is transforming the library world. More and more libraries are developing ebook collections and patrons are learning to expect this format as an option. Much of this success is the result of devices like the Kindle and iPad which mimic a much more natural reading experience, at least in the traditional sense. Reading a novel or any text straight through works well on these devices. However, not every type of reader interacts with a book like this and in fact many academic faculty and researchers need more freedom to read in ways that support their individual research practices.",
