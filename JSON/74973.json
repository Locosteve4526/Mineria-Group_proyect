        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;The introduction and emergence of Artificial intelligence (AI) has served to streamline the workflow in nursing education, but has also posed some important questions regarding the appropriate use of AI. The educational potential of AI is still emerging, with numerous unexplored applications and open questions. The purpose of this program is to explore how artificial intelligence (AI), including Chat GPT and other related search engines, can be used to assist the scholarly efforts of nurse faculty, specifically to target the right journal to submit a publication and during other steps of the process for writing for publication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI can provide valuable assistance during the pre-writing phase of scholarship. For example, AI can assist scholars by (1) identifying relevant nursing journals, (2) generating query letter templates for journal editors, and (3) creating preliminary manuscript outlines to guide focused writing Because AI is such a novel technology, with many unknowns, this program will address areas of caution to acknowledge when using AI during the writing process. Responsible AI use requires transparency through: (1) adherence to copyright laws and author guidelines, (2) explicit disclosure of AI's role in manuscript development, and (3) awareness of AI-detection markers such as distinctive word patterns and writing styles. It is important to note that there is currently no accurate method available to identify AI use, and this is an identified area for future development in AI. The program will culminate with strategies for exploring AI use in scholarly writing to become a knowledgeable, ethical consumer and user of AI.&lt;/span&gt;",
