        "Description/Abstract": "The SIAM eBook Program provides access to a core collection of applied mathematics titles through either a Perpetual Access or Annual Subscription option. SIAM's eBook content can be retrieved through individual chapters that are downloadable as PDFs. The search tools available on the site are insufficient to provide easy access to content in the collection through the SIAM Web site. However, SIAM does provide MARC records allowing for the discovery of the eBooks through a library's local catalog. Additionally, SIAM does not apply DRM technology to the files making the materials easy for patrons to use. ",
