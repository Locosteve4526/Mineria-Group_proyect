        "Description/Abstract": "We measure the effect of resource\u2010sector dependence on long\u2010run income growth using the natural experiment of coal mining in 409 Appalachian counties selected for homogeneity. Using a panel data set (1970\u20132010), we find a one standard deviation increase in resource dependence is associated with 0.5\u20131 percentage point long\u2010run and a 0.2 percentage point short\u2010run decline in the annual growth rate of per capita personal income. We also measure the extent to which the resource curse operates through disincentives to education, and find significant effects, but this \u201ceducation channel\u201d explains less than 15 percent of the apparent curse.",
