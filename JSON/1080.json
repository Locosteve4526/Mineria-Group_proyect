        "Description/Abstract": "Libraries have become iPad enthusiasts on a global scale. Ko\u00e7 University Library, Istanbul, Turkey1; Briar Cliff University, Sioux City, Iowa2; Colby College, Waterville, Maine3; Central Medical Library, University of M\u00fcnster, Germany4; Omaha Public Library, Omaha, Nebraska5; and Westlake High School Library, Austin, Texas6 are just a few of the many libraries that include iPads in their suite of tools and services. Librarians use the mobile device in all aspects of their work, and they are an ever-present part of our patrons' lives. As a result, there is a growing need for library staff members to be familiar with the technology. This article describes Boise State University Albertsons Library\u2019s use of mobile technology, specifically iPads, and the internal shifts that occurred as the library made mobile devices accessible to all library employees.",
