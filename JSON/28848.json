        "Description/Abstract": "Corporate reporting of non-financial information is on the rise, with over 3,000 companies now reporting in accordance with the standards developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).  While such reporting has traditionally been voluntary, a number of European countries are moving to requiring disclosure of non-financial information as a condition of stock exchange listing.  This paper surveys the current and future use of stock exchanges as a mechanism for increased corporate reporting by examining existing and proposed laws and requirements in the United Kingdom and other countries, and projects the trajectory of this trend.",
