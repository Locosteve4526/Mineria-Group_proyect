        "Description/Abstract": "The lower Lesser Himalayan sequence marks the northern extremity of the  exposed Indian plate, and is generally interpreted                      as a passive margin. Five lines of evidence,  however, collectively suggest a continental arc setting: (1) igneous  intrusions                      and volcanic rocks occur at this stratigraphic  level across the length of the Himalaya, (2) ages of intrusive and  metavolcanic                      (?) rocks cluster at 1780\u20131880 Ma but also indicate  a long-lived igneous process, (3) detrital zircon ages in clastic rocks                      cluster at 1800\u20131900 Ma, with a unimodal age  distribution in some rocks, (4) the mineralogy and chemistry of  metasedimentary                      rocks differ from typical shales and suggest a  volcanogenic source, (5) trace-element chemistries of orthogneisses and  metabasalts                      are more consistent with either an arc or a  collisional setting. Intercalation of volcanic rocks with clastic  sediments and                      a general absence of Proterozoic metamorphic ages  do not support a collisional origin. An arc model further underscores  the                      profound unconformity separating lower-upper Lesser  Himalayan rocks, indicating that a Paleoproterozoic arc may have formed                      the stratigraphic base of the northern Indian  margin. This, in turn, may indicate disposition of the Indian plate  adjacent                      to North America in the ca. 1800 Ma supercontinent  Columbia. Felsic orthogneisses (&quot;Ulleri&quot;) likely represent shallow  intrusions,                      not Indian basement.",
