        "Description/Abstract": "The objective of this project is to assess habitat use by pygmy rabbits in relation to variation in three key, interacting habitat resources: structure which defines the fearscape; temperature which defines the thermalscape; and diet which defines the foodscape. In effect, we will assess fear-, thermal-, and food-scapes to define and predict the functional use of sagebrush habitat by pygmy rabbits.  Our central hypothesis is that pygmy rabbits will place the highest value on habitats that minimize risk of predation, provide optimal temperatures, and maximize quality of food.\nRole:  Supporting",
