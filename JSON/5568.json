        "Description/Abstract": "This article describes the educational reform efforts surrounding writing placement in one state context. We propose that placement offers a particularly useful engagement point because it is often controlled by state-level policies and it directly impacts the lived experience of first-year college students. To document how we worked across institutions in our state, we describe a series of texts that we wrote collaboratively \u2013 texts ranging from a whitepaper to reports. Then, we explore the challenges and opportunities afforded by our long-\nterm engagement with policymakers. Ultimately, we propose strategies that writing program administrators might consider as they become engaged with state-level higher education policy.",
