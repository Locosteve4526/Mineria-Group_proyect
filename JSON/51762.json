        "Description/Abstract": "For two decades, a rural \u201cpeace community\u201d in San Jos\u00e9 de Apartad\u00f3 has resisted armed conflict in Urab\u00e1, one of Colombia\u2019s most war-torn regions. Resisting land grabbing by entrepreneurs tied to drug trafficking, agribusiness, or mining, the Peace Community refuses to support paramilitaries, army soldiers, and guerrillas. Based on ethnographic action research over a twelve year period, Christopher Courtheyn illuminates the community\u2019s understandings of peace and territorial practices against ongoing assassinations and forced displacement. Researched during Colombia\u2019s peace process between the government and FARC guerrillas, Community of Peace illuminates grassroots peacebuilding. Through geographical performances with the dead, the land, and fellow resistance communities, San Jos\u00e9 creates a radical and relational peace of ecological dignity. Courtheyn intervenes into debates about the meaning of peace and territory, while also interrogating the role of race in Colombia\u2019s war and the relationship between memory and peace. Amid the widespread violence of today\u2019s global crisis, Community of Peace illustrates San Jos\u00e9\u2019s rupture with the logics of coloniality and capitalism through the construction of political solidarity and communal peace.",
