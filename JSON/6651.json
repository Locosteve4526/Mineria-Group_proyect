        "Description/Abstract": "We have studied dynamic iterations for thalamo-cortical systems written in terms of Volterra integro-differential equations with the convolution kernel defined by a step function. The iteration process separates each equation from the other equations in the model and is suitable for efficient implementation in parallel environments, significantly reducing the computational time. The amount of processors working independently for each iteration is allowed to vary between 1 and N, depending on available resources.\r\n\r\nWe have derived error bounds for the iteration process and showed its convergence. The error bounds are derived using the kernel of the model and are written in terms of its parameters. The convergence of the dynamic iterations is illustrated by a sequence of numerical experiments with different numbers of equations N.",
