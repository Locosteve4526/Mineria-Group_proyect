        "Description/Abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event which results in psychological trauma. This event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else, or to one's own or someone else's physical, sexual, or psychological integrity, overwhelming the individual's psychological defenses. This book presents and discusses topical data on PTSD including: PTSD in refugee communities; linking juvenile delinquency to PTSD; psychosocial factors contributing to resilience in the aftermath of potentially traumatic events in adulthood; genetic markers in suicidal and non-suicidal veterans with combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder; conventional and new treatments for PTSD; and others.",
