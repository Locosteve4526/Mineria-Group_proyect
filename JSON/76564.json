        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Personal branding has become a critical aspect of professional success, particularly in today\u2019s competitive and unstable economy. However, many graduate business students enter the job market without a well-defined personal brand. This study outlines and evaluates a theory-informed curriculum designed to help MBA students develop and communicate their personal brand through storytelling. The curriculum was implemented across three courses throughout the span of the students\u2019 program, with students engaging in activities to develop their brand identity and articulate it through storytelling. Quantitative data from two student cohorts showed significant improvements in personal brand equity (appeal and differentiation) and professional identity clarity over time, compared to a control group. Qualitative analyses revealed key themes in students\u2019 brand narratives, such as growth, resilience, and integrity. This study contributes to the personal branding literature by demonstrating the effectiveness of a structured storytelling intervention, and highlights its potential as a resource-efficient method for enhancing graduate business education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
