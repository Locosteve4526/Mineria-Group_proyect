        "Description/Abstract": "Some teaching centers flounder while others flourish. This paper provides concrete suggestions for launching or revitalizing a teaching center, drawn from the experiences of these authors and from principles in the literature. Two center directors worked to apply the principles in the literature to their newly launched or revitalized centers. One of the authors (Tara) was placed in charge of a floundering center. Dramatic changes transformed it from a &quot;forgotten unit&quot; to a flourishing center. The other author (Susan) launched a new center, which is well on its way to playing a central role in university life.",
