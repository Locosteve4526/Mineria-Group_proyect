        "Description/Abstract": "Comparison of literacy in South Korea and the United States through the lens of a ten-year old exemplifies a comparative survey study conducted in both the United States and South Korea. The ongoing study measures students' reading habits and their perceptions of the adults in their lives as readers over a seven-year period. Some questions that have driven the study include, &quot;What affective filters influence development of students' reading skills? Do teachers model leisure reading interests and habits through example? Do teachers share books with students or parts of books they are reading? Do teachers generate frequent discourse with their students about books read outside of assigned material?&quot;",
