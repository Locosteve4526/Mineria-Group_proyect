        "Description/Abstract": "W. S. Merwin\u2019s 1998 volume The Folding Cliffs is a book-length narrative poem about the famous nineteenth-century Kauaians Pi\u2018ilani and her husband Ko\u2018olau.  The poem tells how the couple kept their family intact by preventing the exile of Ko\u2018olau and the couple\u2019s son Kaleimanu to the leper colony on the remote island of Moloka\u2018i.  Merwin characterizes Pi\u2018ilani as the protagonist, partly by beginning his narrative after the deaths of the husband and son and focusing on Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s memory of them, then circling back to present their story more fully.  Toward the end of The Folding Cliffs, moreover, Merwin describes Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s dictation of her story about her son and husband\u2019s last days to the journalist John Sheldon.  While this part of Merwin\u2019s narrative poem records Sheldon\u2019s documentation and revision of Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s story about her husband\u2019s leprosy and death, it also echoes and differs from Merwin\u2019s own account of Ko\u2018olau\u2019s last days, a story Merwin dramatizes in the preceding pages of his poem.  In this self-reflexive scene of writing, Merwin invites his readers to speculate upon the similarities and differences between his poetic account of Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s story and Sheldon\u2019s version of it.  Beyond that, this narrative doubling reveals Merwin\u2019s awareness that his writing risks violating the integrity of Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s experience just as much as Sheldon\u2019s does.  While Merwin accepts the impossibility of telling Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s story more accurately than Sheldon did, he also forces his readers to recognize the autonomy of Pi\u2018ilani and her family by repeatedly expressing her sense that her story differs from Sheldon\u2019s expectations about it.  Paradoxically, Merwin\u2019s readers experience Pi\u2018ilani most vividly through her sense of difference, but that difference also guarantees that she remains \u201cother\u201d to the reader.  \r\nBy portraying Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s dictation of her story to John Sheldon, Merwin makes his readers keenly aware of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak\u2019s claim that \u201cAll speaking, even seemingly the most immediate, entails a distanced decipherment by another, which is, at best, an interception\u201d (309).   In focusing on the issues of \u201cdecipherment\u201d and \u201cinterception\u201d as she tells her story, Merwin underscores the irony and personal compromise of  Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s predicament.  As a \u201cnative informant\u201d (to use Spivak\u2019s phrase), Pi\u2018ilani experiences the alienation entailed in the \u201cinterception\u201d of her story by Sheldon.  Since Pi\u2018ilani learns to read and write in The Folding Cliffs, Merwin implies that she could have written her own story instead of reporting it to Sheldon (though she would presumably have encountered difficulty in publishing it by herself).  Merwin lets his readers see Sheldon\u2019s sympathy at work as he records Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s story, but he also invites them to recognize how Sheldon\u2019s assumptions and concerns as a writer frame, and even skew, Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s experience.  At the same time, Merwin allows his readers to recognize his own dependency on Sheldon\u2019s narrative for important details of Pi\u2018ilani\u2019s story (a dependency he admits to when he describes his experience of reading Frances N. Frazier\u2019s translation of Sheldon\u2019s book in \u201cHow I Came to Write The Folding Cliffs\u201d). In doing so, he invites his readers to honor  Pi\u2018ilani as the source of her story, recognizing that because he offers only a version of it, they can admire its protagonist and sympathize with her without presuming to know or possess her story in a definitive (and hence totalizing) way.  \r\n",
