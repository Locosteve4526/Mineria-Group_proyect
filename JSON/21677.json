        "Description/Abstract": "We test whether traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) about how to make an item predicts a person\u2019s skill at making it. The rationale for this research is that the failure to distinguish between knowledge and skill might account for some of the conflicting results about the relationships between TEK, human health, and economic development. We present an empirical test of the association between individual knowledge about how to make an arrow or a bag and a measure of individual skill at making these items among the Tsimane\u2019 (Bolivia). We find no association between our measure of knowledge and of skill. While we cannot rule out the possibility of a real association between the phenomena of knowledge and skill, we interpret our findings as support for the claim that researchers should distinguish between methods to measure knowledge and skill when studying trends in TEK. \r\nRole:  Supporting",
