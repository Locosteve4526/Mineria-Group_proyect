        "Description/Abstract": "Objectives: Despite the substantial presence of South-Asian&lt;br&gt;international students in the United States, research on their&lt;br&gt;sexual health remains limited. The current research aims to fill&lt;br&gt;this gap by investigating condom use and perceived barriers&lt;br&gt;and benefits among South-Asian international students at a&lt;br&gt;Midwest university.&lt;br&gt;Method: A cross-sectional exploratory study design was&lt;br&gt;employed, with data collected through an online survey.&lt;br&gt;Participants (N = 104) completed a questionnaire assessing condom&lt;br&gt;use behavior, perceived barriers, and benefits, as well as&lt;br&gt;demographic information.&lt;br&gt;Results: Results indicated that most participants reported using&lt;br&gt;condoms during sexual intercourse. Common barriers to condom&lt;br&gt;use include embarrassment, concerns about reduced sexual&lt;br&gt;pleasure, and lack of knowledge. Perceived benefits&lt;br&gt;included protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted&lt;br&gt;infections, providing a sense of security, and reducing&lt;br&gt;worry and anxiety. Logistic regression analysis did not identify&lt;br&gt;statistically significant predictors of condom use among South-&lt;br&gt;Asian international students.&lt;br&gt;Conclusion: Findings underscores the need for culturally sensitive&lt;br&gt;sexual health interventions tailored to the unique needs of&lt;br&gt;this population. Future research should explore additional factors&lt;br&gt;influencing condom use and employ larger sample sizes to&lt;br&gt;enhance understanding and inform targeted interventions.",
