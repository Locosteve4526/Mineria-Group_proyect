        "Description/Abstract": "Approximately 1 in 88 children in the United States are being diagnosed with the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that carries with it lifelong physical, emotional, and behavioral consequences. Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the severity of the symptoms. To assist healthcare providers in the management of the autism symptoms, a new smartphone application was developed that allows physicians to observe patient behaviors between office visits, and to manage the patient\u2019s medication based on the information observed. An evaluation was conducted to determine ease of use of the smartphone application by two physicians and three caregivers of patients with autism. The results showed that the new smartphone application will be able to assist the physician in monitoring patients with ASD more accurately than when only using subjective reports provided by caregivers during office visits. The smartphone application technology promises to help both caregivers and physicians in improving medication management for their autism patients.",
