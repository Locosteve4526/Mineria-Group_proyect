        "Description/Abstract": "OVERVIEW OF SYMPOSIUM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2011, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) established the Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program, which has become the world\u2019s largest entrepreneurial training program for would-be academic entrepreneurs. I-Corps prepares university and federal lab scientists and engineers to\u00a0extend their focus beyond the laboratory to accelerate the transfer of cutting-edge research into\u00a0commercial success. As I-Corps has expanded, it has made its presence felt in academic\u00a0entrepreneurship. There are now ten NSF I-Corps Regional \u201cHubs,\u201d involving over 80 research\u00a0universities. According to the NSF I-Corps Biennial Report (2021), I-Corps has educated more\u00a0than 6,500 grant participants from the NSF, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Department\u00a0of Energy (DOE), and trained more than 2,300 entrepreneurial teams. These teams are typically\u00a0small (i.e., three individuals) and include individuals with both scientific and business-related\u00a0expertise. I-Corps teams have raised more than $1.2 Billion in subsequent funding for start-up\u00a0activity.&lt;br&gt;Evaluating the effectiveness of the I-Corps program is critical to its future success since\u00a0NSF and other federal agencies are looking to expand the program. Duval-couetil, Epstein, and\u00a0Huang-saad (2022) note that I-Corps has been evaluated in a number of ways, and they suggest a\u00a0need for alternative evaluation and assessment data that could be used to better understand the\u00a0effects of regional programs, as well as how those programs might be improved. However, the\u00a0overarching theme of this symposium is linking entrepreneurship and innovation literature to&lt;br&gt;assess the effectiveness of an entrepreneurship training program (the NSF I-Corps program) on\u00a0generating potential entrepreneurs (academic entrepreneurs) and show how this program is\u00a0producing sustainable impacts on society (innovations). Four presentations are included in the\u00a0symposium, representing different approaches to understanding the critical role of Hubs of I-Corps\u00a0trainees across the U.S. by reinforcing the fundamental components of the entrepreneurial and\u00a0innovation process.&lt;br&gt;The presentations in this session illustrate a variety of \u201cmicro\u201d and \u201cmacro\u201d perspectives\u00a0on academic entrepreneurship (Waldman, Vaulont, Balven, Siegel, &amp; Rupp, 2022; Siegel &amp;\u00a0Wright, 2015), including theories of organizational justice; identity; role conflict; ambivalence;\u00a0championing/leadership; feedback; knowledge spillovers; diversity, equity, and inclusion;\u00a0business model experimentation; pivoting; strategy formulation and implementation; networks;\u00a0and team dynamics. Likewise, novel methods to provide evidence and implications. Our session\u00a0is also inspired by the AOM 2024 theme \u201cInnovating for the future: policy, purpose and\u00a0organizations\u201d since it deals with a federal program that is targeted to train the next generation of\u00a0successful academic entrepreneurs.",
