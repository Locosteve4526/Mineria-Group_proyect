        "Description/Abstract": "The switch from wired communications to mobile (wireless) technologies has profound implications on the nature of work and the expectations associated with the work.  This study provides a summary of mobile technology research, summarizes positive and negative implications, and analyzes the opinions of 250 members of the northern and western Texas Society for Human Resource Management chapters for their opinions of how mobile and wired technologies compare.  Results showed the greatest difference involving the amount of business-related contacts that can be made.  In comparing mobile to wired differences, three groups of variables stood out\u2014social contacts, threats to employees, and freedom for employees to act.  Mobile technologies tended to be more associated with these groups than wired technologies.",
