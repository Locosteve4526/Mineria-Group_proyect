        "Description/Abstract": "Response to intervention (RTl) is increasingly used to organize reading instruction and\nassessment. One component of an RTI framework is the universal screening of students to\ndetermine who is at risk for developing reading problems. For screening to be effective, it must\nbe efficient, accurate and have positive consequences for its use. This article discusses the current\napproaches to screening and their limitations, and provides recommendations for improvement.",
