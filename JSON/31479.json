        "Description/Abstract": "The Challis Astronomical Observatory (CAO) has been surveying a sample of blazar-type AGN since 2010. The CAO blazar sample includes 43 sources - two-thirds being FSRQs and one-third being BL Lacs - covering a redshift range 0.02 \u3008z \u30082. Observations are carried out in BVRI filters. Here we describe the pipeline that has been designed and implemented to perform astrometry, extract sources and calculate photometric data. Included are results from our 2010-2015 dataset with comparisons to Fermi data and other surveys of FSRQs and BL Lacs.",
