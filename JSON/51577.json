        "Description/Abstract": "Representing half of the workforce, women have been consistently underrepresented in the construction industry. Unlike other fields that have improved upon the lack of diversity, construction remains one of the most male-dominated fields in the United States. The ever increasing demand for workers is breaking down the unique barriers that women have faced. Though these barriers still exist, efforts to attract and retain women in the construction industry are improving. This study aims to investigate the factors that are most influential in attracting women to and retaining them in management careers in the construction industry. A funded research study with ELECTRI International provided support to identify the attraction and retention factors for women working in management positions in the electrical construction industry. A web-based survey was distributed throughout the nation and collected the perceptions and experiences of managerial-level workers in the electrical industry. In total, 686 managers responded to the survey, 71 of whom were women. Upon testing of the data, significant differences emerged in the influence of factors in attracting and retaining women versus men. These findings contribute to the industry\u2019s understanding of advancing women in the construction industry.",
