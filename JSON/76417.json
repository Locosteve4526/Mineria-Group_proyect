        "Description/Abstract": "This independent annual report of Idaho Youth Ranch (IYR) program effectiveness was constructed by independent researchers from Boise State University\u2019s Department of Psychological Science. The objective of this report is to summarize the effectiveness of IYR services at improving the well-being of the at-risk youth it serves. Specifically, we report on data which captures changes in clients\u2019 sense of hope and resilience, their emotional, social and psychological well-being, academic performance, substance use, and criminal behavior while they were receiving services. Statistical analyses of the 2024 data indicate that the IYR programs and services helped clients improve in several critical well-being domains. Clients\u2019 average ratings on the hope and resilience measures increased by 27.4% and 28.7% respectively. On average, client ratings of emotional and social well-being were also enhanced. The result was a 22.6% improvement in emotional well-being and a 36.3% increase in social well-being while receiving IYR services. Psychological well-being also improved by 33.3%. Clients were most likely to enter services with a moderate level of overall functioning and to finish in the flourishing category of the Mental Health Continuum. Positive trends were also observed in behavioral domains. Clients\u2019 self-reported similar or slightly better academic performance during their treatment period. Data indicate that clients\u2019 substance abuse and illegal behaviors remained rare at both time points; between 89.0% and 94.5% of clients reported that they never engaged in these activities. In this high-risk group, the maintenance of these very high levels of abstinence over the treatment period is a notable success. The sum of the analyses presented in this report provides a strong basis for concluding that IYR programs and services provide consistent, positive effects on the at-risk youth who participate in them.",
