        "Description/Abstract": "On March 13, 2012, Japan, the United States, and the European Union filed Requests for Consultations (Requests) with the World Trade Organization (WTO), contesting China\u2019s export restrictions on rare earth elements (REE).  The Requests were long expected, given the growing importance of REE, coupled with China\u2019s near-total dominance in the REE market.  This Article predicts that, in light of the WTO\u2019s recent Appellate Body decision in the China \u2013 Raw Materials case, China will not successfully defend its REE export restrictions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT  1994).\nThe legal issues that arise in both China \u2013 Raw Materials and China\u2019s export restrictions of REE are significant for WTO jurisprudence because they address long-standing tensions between free trade and environmental protection.  This Article discusses the Raw Materials Appellate Body\u2019s analysis of the environmental and conservation defenses China raised under GATT 1994 Articles XI, XX(b), and XX(g).  While China\u2019s export restrictions were held to violate its WTO obligations, the interpretation of Articles XX(b) and XX(g) left WTO jurisprudence largely unchanged and demonstrated the Appellate Body\u2019s willingness to uphold legitimate environmental and conservation measures.  This Article then evaluates the factual and evidentiary issues China faces in the REE dispute, in light of China \u2013 Raw Materials, and identifies potential hurdles that will impair China\u2019s ability to prevail in the REE case.\n",
