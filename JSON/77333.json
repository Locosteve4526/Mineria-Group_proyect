        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the factors that influence the decision to formally register a new venture by nascent entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding these factors is important because registration is the inflection point where entrepreneurs move from the informal to the formal economy. Registered businesses are more likely to pay taxes, hire employees, access capital for growth, and participate in other activities that contribute to economic development. In Study 1, we interviewed entrepreneurs and institutional actors in Ghana and Ivory Coast to identify factors that influence the registration decision, and data was analyzed using the grounded theory development approach . In Study 2, we develop a model from Study 1, and use a survey design to explore how these influence the registration decision. In Study 3, we create a decision tree based on our findings from Study 2, and use a scenario design to test the external validity of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;",
