        "Description/Abstract": "Modern liberalism\u2019s concept of autonomy undermines the core experiences of family life and hence disrupts family life when liberals seek to apply those concepts to practice.  No small part of family disruption can be traced to the aggressive stance of modern liberals.  The elements of family life that today\u2019s liberals cannot explain are those that relate to dependence and the body: the relation between parenthood and a duty to educate children and the connection between marriage and parenthood, are among the relations that liberals misunderstand.",
