        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\nHexagonal boron nitride is a beneficial coating material as it has been found to have properties exhibiting anti-corrosion and thermal and chemical stability. Specifically, boron nitrides anti-corrosive properties would be a beneficial coating material on nuclear reactant cooling pipes as they are prone to corrosion. Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is a process in which gasses are fed into a chamber via separate channels at relatively low temperatures to react via radiofrequency plasma along with direct current power to create a solid thin film deposited onto a substrate. Boron nitride thin films have been made using the PECVD process at temperatures around 600\u00b0 C using N\u2082, H\u2082, and BCl3 gasses. In attempt to recreate that outcome, N\u2082, H\u2082, and BCl3 gasses were used under depositions set at lower temperatures, 100-150\u00b0 C, using silicon wafers as the substrate. The thin films were analyzed for thickness via profilometry, and for film content using infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Based on the results, boron nitride, boric acid, and ammonium chloride may be present in the resulting deposited films.",
