        "Description/Abstract": "Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a form of environmental regulation that imposes legal responsibility for product recycling and disposal on product manufacturers and brand owners.  Use of EPR legislation as a regulatory tool is on an upward trajectory in the U.S., with 34 states having passed at least one EPR law.  Common types of products covered by EPR include electronic waste, mercury-containing items, and paint.  This project explores trends in the passage and implementation of EPR legislation through the lens of state government, focusing on a representative sampling of states as case studies on attempts to implement EPR.",
