        "Description/Abstract": "Ten new copper(II) complexes of five potential bisthiocarbohydrazone and biscarbohydrazone ligands were synthesized and physico-chemically characterized. The spectral and magnetic studies of compounds are consistent with the formation of asymmetric di-, tri- or tetranuclear copper(II) complexes of deprotonated forms of respective ligands. The variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements of all complexes show antiferromagnetic interactions between the Cu(II) centers, in agreement with very broad powder EPR spectra. However, frozen solution EPR spectral studies are found in contradiction with the solid-state magnetic studies and indicate that the complexes are not very stable in solutions; the possible fragmentations of complexes are found in agreement with MALDI MS results. The EPR spectral simulation of most of the compounds is in agreement with the presence of two uncoupled Cu(II) species in solution.",
