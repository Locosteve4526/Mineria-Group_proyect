        "Description/Abstract": "Assessment is a broad topic in higher education, and often used for program review, outcomes assessment, or institutional accreditation. To narrow the focus to student learning, Walvoord (2004) defined assessment as &quot;the systematic collection of information about student learning, using the time, knowledge, expertise, and resources available, in order to inform decisions about how to improve learning&quot; (p. 2; italics in original). Readers should consider assessment as a specialized area of research which seeks to measure of student learning. Assessment is more akin to action research, where the purpose of the research is to inform and improve self-practice. The typical steps in action research are to plan, act, observe, and reflect. In Figure 1, see how action research maps onto a systematic approach to assessing student outcomes (Suskie, 2009).",
