        "Description/Abstract": "The paper presented by professor Gandarias Beldarrain was titled \u201cThe Basque Cultural Magazine Euzko-Gogoa: The Transoceanic Basque Will.\u201d  It examined the political and aesthetic positions of the cultural magazine Euzko-Gogoa (Basque Will, 1950-1960) published in the Basque exile, by focusing on the literary work produced in its pages and in the network of Basque intellectuals created in exile. \n \nShe explained how the network created through the various publications was able to save and rebuild the beloved motherland through these Basque individuals\u2019 language, euskara. Euskara became the cohesive element to rebuild the defeated Basque culture and nation during the dark years of the dictatorship in Spain. The network of writers allowed for the creation of an imagined community and a place of dialogue to develop a national consensus. The magazine became the space for the Basque identity to be debated and redefined. In summary, the paper showed that  the Basque culture in exile was shaped and formed  \u2013 by its traumatic history and multilingual and transnational population.  \n",
