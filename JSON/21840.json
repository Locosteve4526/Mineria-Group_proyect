        "Description/Abstract": "In \u201cOn Being Ill\u201d (1926), Virginia Woolf observes, \u201cNovels, one would have thought, would have been devoted to influenza\u201d (4).  Modernist novels in particular, one would add.  The experimental aesthetics of modernism and its troubling of mind/body assumptions made illness a particularly apt subject for modernists, while the 1918 global pandemic of influenza\u2014killing in four months an estimated 50 million people\u2014had made the experience of illness a shared, buried trauma.  Nonetheless, literary criticism of modernism has not followed Woolf\u2019s cue by considering physical illness as one of its \u201cprime themes\u201d (4).  This paper proposes that Woolf\u2019s \u201cOn Being Ill\u201d is a pivotal manifesto of modernist aesthetics and ethics that can lead to productive reconsiderations of modernism\u2019s terrain as critics reassess its boundaries.   \nWoolf revalues the \u201coutsider\u201d and \u201coutlaw\u201d perspective which illness creates as the subject relinquishes citizenship among \u201cthe army of the upright\u201d (18).  In generating a mode of lyric reception that encourages digressive thought, this outlaw perspective produces the narrative experimentation and defamiliarization essential to modernist experiment and the possibility of revolutionary thought.  Three novels with outsider protagonists that are modernist variations on the bildungsroman and quest genres\u2014Woolf\u2019s The Voyage Out, H.D.\u2019s HERmione, and Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness\u2014use the perspective of illness to create powerful new aesthetic effects and engage readers in ethical questions.  As these novels show and Woolf\u2019s \u201cOn Being Ill\u201d emphasizes, the extremity of illness creates a threshold perspective that lays bare the consequences of gendered, imperialist ideologies.\n\nRole:  Principal",
