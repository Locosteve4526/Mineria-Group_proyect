        "Description/Abstract": "Horace Walpole\u2019s &lt;em&gt;The Castle of Otranto&lt;/em&gt; is often credited with establishing the Gothic novel\u2019s preoccupation with the supernatural, yet the text is equally shaped by empirical moments that interrupt its eerie atmosphere. This paper examines how Walpole\u2019s use of rational explanations, legalistic language, and detailed descriptions of the physical world disrupts the immersive Gothic experience, shifting the reader\u2019s attention between narrative absorption and self-aware scrutiny. Using Richard Lanham\u2019s concept of bistable decorum, which describes the oscillation between &lt;em&gt;looking through&lt;/em&gt; a text\u2019s meaning and &lt;em&gt;looking at&lt;/em&gt; its rhetorical form, this analysis explores how empirical moments in Otranto force the reader to acknowledge the constructed nature of the story. Rather than seamlessly integrating supernatural and rational elements, Walpole\u2019s novel creates a dynamic interplay between belief and skepticism, ultimately shaping the Gothic mode as a genre that both invites and destabilizes readerly immersion.",
