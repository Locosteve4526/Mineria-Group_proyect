        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;To explore the relationship between institutional level and nascent institutional entrepreneurial behavior, we interviewed a sample of forty-five entrepreneurs in the blockchain industry in Kenya and Nigeria. Some of these individuals were acting at Williamson\u2019s lowest level, allocating resources to effect change in the market, while others were operating at Williamson\u2019s highest levels, working to change the rules of the game, or even the perspectives of their society. We found that opportunity identification, perceptions of risk, perceptions of likelihood of success, and resource allocation varied based on the level at which the individual endeavored to change the institutional environment.&lt;/p&gt;",
