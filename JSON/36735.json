        "Description/Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nAs organizations continue to expand their implementation of Lean practices, business schools and corporate training organizations have developed numerous games and simulations aimed at teaching Lean concepts in manufacturing settings. However, simulations have lagged behind the most recent adaptations of Lean outside of the factory, in services and more specifically in office settings. In this paper, we present a Lean simulation game, referred to as \u201cComputer Solutions, Inc.\u201d that provides participants with hands-on experience in applying Lean principles in a non-manufacturing setting. \n\nThe simulation takes place in the order-quote department at \u201cComputer Solutions, Inc.\u201d, a company specialized in designing customized computer solutions for small businesses. The order-quote process is purely office-based and involves such activities as collecting information, processing information, filling out documents, and moving those documents to different parts of the organization. This simulation is a \u201cpencil-and-paper\u201d exercise and is performed entirely off-line.\n\nOur simulation brings some unique benefits that are often missing from current Lean manufacturing-based simulations. It involves multiple rounds of Lean improvements that can span several weeks providing students a chance to identify wastes and to make a thoughtful application of Lean tools and techniques. Students also get to experience the challenges of group dynamics that are present in team-based improvement efforts. \n",
