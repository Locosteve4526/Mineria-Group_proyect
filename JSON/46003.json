        "Description/Abstract": "significantly limiting teacher observation as a way to systematically improve instructional practice.\nUnderstanding the rationales that raters provide as they evaluate teacher performance with an observation\nprotocol offers one way to better understand the training efforts required to improve rater accuracy. The purpose\nof this study was to examine the accuracy of raters evaluating special education teachers\u2019 implementation of\nevidence-based math instruction. A mixed-methods approach was used to investigate: 1) the consistency of the\nraters\u2019 application of the scoring criteria to evaluate teachers\u2019 lessons, 2) raters\u2019 accuracy on two lessons with\nthose given by expert-raters, and 3) the raters\u2019 understanding and application of the scoring criteria through a\nthink-aloud process. The results show that raters had difficulty understanding some of the high inference items in\nthe rubric and applying them accurately and consistently across the lessons. Implications for rater training are\ndiscussed.",
