        "Description/Abstract": "For a conference themed &quot;Climates of Change in the American West,&quot; I organized and led a discussion session inviting idea-sharing about current campus and disciplinary challenges. Many participants currently work as deans, associate deans, and directors of academic affairs, so conversation was wide-ranging and practical. I shared current work of the Humanities Advisory Board and identified off-campus partners interested in following that work. I took notes on a Google Doc during the session, and all participants asked to have their comments posted, emails shared, and to access the doc to continue communication. All agreed that a similar session should become a regular WLA offering, allowing WLA members to share administrative as well as scholarly ideas. As far as any of us knew, the session was a first in that regard.",
