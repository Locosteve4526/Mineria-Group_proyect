        "Description/Abstract": "Like measure, the notion of (spatial) dimension has been made mathematically precise for finite-dimensional spaces a long time ago. An analog for infinite dimensionality is more elusive. In this talk, we discuss a concept introduced in 1974 by William Haver. Haver's concept, on the one hand, has analogies with a measure related concept introduced in 1919 by Emile Borel, and on the other hand - viewed through a game-theoretic lens - corresponds to an infinitary version of dimension. The main mathematical result to be presented is joint work with Liljana Babinkostova.",
