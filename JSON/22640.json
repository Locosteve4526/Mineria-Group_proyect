        "Description/Abstract": "Last autumn I participated in a BBC Program called &quot;Pompeii&quot;, similar to Discovery Channel version.  This version, however, was led by Martha Kearny of BBC.   I worked with the producer as a consultant for many months before the filming took place. I also filmed with the producer for two days in and around Naples, Italy.  The show aired on BBC last February (2013). ",
