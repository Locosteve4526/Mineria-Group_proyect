        "Description/Abstract": "This article received 1757 reads, and was (re)published 16 times.\nNote that the reason I say it was peer-reviewed is because the editorial process for this forum is quite demanding. The editor was my writing superior. \n\nThe textbook has been declared dead many times over. Progressive educator John Dewey decried the \u201ctext-book fetish\u201d back in the 1890s. Former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan wished out loud for textbooks to become obsolete. Articles on the demise of textbooks regularly appear with each new school year. They describe these books as only so much content, as an indifferent information dump, as dead tree versions of information that would be better presented interactively, via multiple media.\n\nThis article is different. As the author of book titled \u201cThe Textbook and the Lecture,\u201d I\u2019ve compiled a list of five reasons why I believe textbooks are here to stay.",
