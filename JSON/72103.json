        "Description/Abstract": "In this study, we explore whether creativity-speak has an effect on crowdfunding campaign success and whether project type and the use of words expressing gratitude and positive tone in the text of the campaign affects the relationship. Utilizing computer-aided text analysis (CATA) on the text of 248,614 crowdfunding campaigns revealed that crowdfunding backers respond positively to creativity-speak. This relationship is stronger for product-based campaigns (eg. games, technology, design) and weaker for content-based campaigns (eg. film, music, publishing). In addition, both positive linguistic tone and the use of words expressing gratitude in the text of the campaign will strengthen the positive effect of creativity-speak on campaign success.",
