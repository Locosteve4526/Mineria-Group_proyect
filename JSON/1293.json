        "Description/Abstract": "To examine our hypothesis that family experiences would be associated  with attitudes toward marriage, we administered the Family Environment  Scale (FES; Moos &amp; Moos, 1986) and a Marriage Attitudes  Questionnaire (MAQ; adapted from Long, 1987) to 40 unmarried college  students. Correlational analyses indicated that for the conflict  subscale of the FES, only two of the six marital expectation questions  approached significance. However, family expressiveness (another  subscale of the FES) was significantly correlated with three of the  marital expectation questions and approached significance with a fourth  question. These results indicated that higher expressiveness in the  family was significantly related to positive attitudes toward marriage.  We concluded that family dynamics need to be studied from multiple  perspectives to identify factors that influence marital expectations. ?",
