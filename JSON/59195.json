        "Description/Abstract": "Salmonellosis is among the most reported foodborne illnesses in the United States. The  Typhimurium DT104 phage type, which is associated with multidrug-resistant disease in humans and animals, possesses an ADP-ribosylating toxin called ArtAB. Full-length AB has been found on a number of broad-host-range non-typhoidal  species and serovars. ArtAB is also homologous to many AB toxins from diverse Gram-negative pathogens, including cholera toxin (CT) and pertussis toxin (PT), and may be involved in  pathogenesis, however, in vitro cellular toxicity of ArtAB has not been characterized. AB was cloned into  and initially isolated using a histidine tag (ArtABHIS) and nickel chromatography. ArtABHIS was found to bind to African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells using confocal microscopy and to interact with glycans present on fetuin and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) using ELISA. Untagged, or native, holotoxin (ArtAB), and the pentameric receptor-binding subunit (ArtB) were purified from  using fetuin and d-galactose affinity chromatography. ArtAB and ArtB metabolic and cytotoxic activities were determined using Vero and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) epithelial cells. Vero cells were more sensitive to ArtAB, however, incubation with both cell types revealed only partial cytotoxicity over 72 h, similar to that induced by CT. ArtAB induced a distinctive clustering phenotype on CHO cells over 72 h, similar to PT, and an elongated phenotype on Vero cells, similar to CT. The ArtB binding subunit alone also had a cytotoxic effect on CHO cells and induced morphological rounding. Results indicate that this toxin induces distinctive cellular outcomes. Continued biological characterization of ArtAB will advance efforts to prevent disease caused by non-typhoidal .",
