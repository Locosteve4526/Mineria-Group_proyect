        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Boise, Idaho, the conference host city, is the only major metropolitan area in the state. But what happens if you are an LGBTQ+ person who lives in one of the other 71,570 sq. miles in this 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest state in the US? The most visible and vocal model of LGBTQ+ identity is one centered on urban areas, political activism, and an \u201cout and proud\u201d queer identity.\u00a0\u00a0 For decades, LGBTQ+ people in Idaho have assumed that if you are going to be LGBTQ+ in this state, you come to Boise. Archival evidence, letters, photographs, newspaper articles, and oral histories reveal, however, that LGBTQ+ people have lived in rural Idaho for well over a century, and it is often no secret within their communities. LGBTQ+ folk choose to live in small towns or in the mountains, drawn by the quality of rural life and family/community heritage. Contrary to expectations, many people report feelings of safety and support within their communities. By exploring the many places and spaces throughout Idaho where LGBTQ+ people stayed, came home to, traveled through, created, or used temporarily to find one another, we can envision alternative models of LGBTQ+ experience and community building as LGBTQ+ people shaped the lives they chose.&lt;/p&gt;",
