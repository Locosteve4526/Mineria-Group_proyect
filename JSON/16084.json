        "Description/Abstract": "The increase in multidrug resistant organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, severely impairs treatment options for immunocompromised individuals and therefore therapeutic strategies that reduce bacterial virulence without aggravating drug resistance are in great demand. This talk focused on optimizing the design, synthesis and evaluation of modified acyl-ACP substrates for LasI AHL synthase enzyme. This work will inform design of quorum sensing inhibitors for P. aeruginosa.",
