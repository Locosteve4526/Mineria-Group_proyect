        "Description/Abstract": "A method and an apparatus for detecting a normal force component and a friction force component between a probe and a sample substance using an interfacial force microscope is disclosed herein. According to one embodiment, a method of measuring normal and friction forces with an interfacial force microscope includes positioning a sample substance on a piezotube and in proximity to a probe suspended from a cantilever such that a molecular force between the sample substance and the probe causes the cantilever to deflect. The method may include converting the deflection of the cantilever into an electrical signal comprising a normal force and a friction force component, and measuring the normal and friction force components.\n\n",
