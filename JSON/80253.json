        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;2021 German Book Prize winner, Antje R\u00e1vik Strubel has stated that her three unrelated novels from 2008, 2011 and 2016 are a trilogy.\u00a0This article shows how this trilogy necessarily ends with a focus on writers, because writers steer readers to places of transformation, connected to water. Applying Jack Halberstam\u2019s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Queer Art of Failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (2011) and Strubel\u2019s 2013 lecture on writing, \u201cSegelt\u00f6rn unter r\u00e4tselhaftem Himmel,\u201d in which Strubel demarcates her call for writing to whirl, blur and confuse, this article explains the importance of water and the metaphor of kayaking for Strubel\u2019s writerly figures. Analyses of Strubel\u2019s writerly craft, of the advantages of getting lost and following detours\u2014especially paddling away from shore, reveal this novel\u2019s journey as a mosaic. Significantly, this article also shows how the writer Ren\u00e9 is central in the novel and linked with the writer Katt.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
