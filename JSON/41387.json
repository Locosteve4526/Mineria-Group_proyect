        "Description/Abstract": "Our poster provides strategies intended to improve retention through early-semester monitoring followed by targeted and personal intervention for students who might be at risk of leaving or failing a course.\r\n\r\nThe tactics include a set of scripts we\u2019ve used to reach out to students who seem to be unengaged or drifting away following Week 1 and Week 3 of the semester. The scripts can be easily modified for students who may experience fatigue or discouragement later in the course. We\u2019ll also include tips and tricks for using a Blackboard site to identify these students.\r\n\r\nBy taking these measures, we provide a more caring environment while offering some accountability to our students during a critical period of their study. These efforts seem simple, but they have an impact on students who may be on the point of departure, discouragement, or even failure.",
