        "Description/Abstract": "Falls in community-dwelling older adults are a complicated phenomenon that are attributed to sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, functional problems, and environmental factors. The current cross-sectional and correlational study aimed to explore comprehensive risk factors for falls in community-dwelling older adults using a nationally representative data file (N = 5,930). Descriptive statistics were used and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Study findings showed that homebound or semi-homebound older adults were 50% more likely to experience a fall than non-homebound individuals. Impaired balance was the strongest predictor (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37, p &lt; 0.001), followed by problems moving around in the home. Arthritis (OR = 1.39, p = 0.009) and depression or anxiety (OR = 1.28, p = 0.013) were additional risk factors. Community health or home health nurses need to assess these risk factors when planning fall intervention programs for older adults using evidence-based prevention strategies.
