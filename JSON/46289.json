These students are in search of a quality learning experience leading to English language acquisition defined by new opportunities that will transform their lives and open doors for future accomplishments. In order to meet their needs, a variety of educational strategies and considerations are required that extend beyond traditional expectations.

A key component of these endeavors is developing and utilizing state of the art technology and coursework, while incorporating outstanding resources and methods to positively impact educators and students.",
