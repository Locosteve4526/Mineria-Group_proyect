        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This session explores how higher education can support the survival and growth of minority languages, using the Basque language as a case study. Collaborative efforts among universities, research centers, and local institutions have been essential in creating innovative, long-lasting programs that promote both the transmission and normalization of the language. At Boise State University, the Basque Studies Program adopts a holistic approach, combining language instruction with cultural education. In addition to standard three-credit courses in language and culture, students engage in weekend workshops that inspire curiosity and foster meaningful connections to Basque heritage. The program has also been pioneering in building inter-institutional partnerships, developing new pedagogical practices, and offering a model that other language programs can adapt. Together, these strategies illustrate how collaborative, holistic approaches in higher education can strengthen linguistic diversity and support cultural sustainability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
