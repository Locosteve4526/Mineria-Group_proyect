        "Description/Abstract": "Previous research has found that mass media influence and loneliness  relate to disordered eating behaviors in women, but little is known  about this relation in men. The present study examined the relations  among disordered eating patterns, gender, mass media influence, and  loneliness in male and female college students. Results of a stepwise  regression revealed that disordered eating attitudes and behaviors (as  measured by the Eating Attitudes Test-26) were predicted by mass media  influence, gender, and loneliness, respectively. In the present study  both male and female college students appear susceptible to developing  disordered eating patterns. Clinicians may wish to address unrealistic  comparisons to media and client interpersonal skills when designing  treatment plans.",
