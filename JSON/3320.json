        "Description/Abstract": "    This article examines the role of food in the context of transnational experiences in Yad\u00e9 Kara\u2019s 2008 novel Cafe Cyprus. Food, I submit, can be used as a lens for understanding global processes, and culinary changes are a good indicator of social and cultural developments within communities. Cafe Cyprus\u2019s protagonist Hasan, a young Turkish-German who has recently moved to London, adopts a transnational subjectivity that he seeks to express with the help of food references. Discussions of cosmopolitanism (with a special focus on the global-local nexus) provide a framework for my analysis of Kara\u2019s text.",
