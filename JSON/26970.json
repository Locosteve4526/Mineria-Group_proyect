        "Description/Abstract": "Video productions created as remixes of multiple sources of video are sometimes referred to as video mashups. Video mashup projects offer the potential of meeting multiple instructional objectives through the processes inherent to video production with repurposed materials. Issues of copyright, fair use, and originality are also exposed during video mashup production and especially when those products are uploaded to YouTube, which has automated systems for detecting copyrighted materials. Human decisions regarding fair use may lie in opposition to the copyright detection systems on YouTube. This paper presents an overview of the possibilities and problems associated with educational video projects involving remix or mashup techniques and the complications that may arise when these types of videos are uploaded to YouTube. The information in this paper is based on the author\u2019s experiences teaching a course on educational video production for YouTube that features a unit on video mashup and remix.\n\n",
