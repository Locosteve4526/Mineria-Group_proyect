        "Description/Abstract": "We have developed a phototransistor that is gated by light. By varying the light intensity incident on a Ge2Se3 -Sn cosputtered material, a family of I-V curves can be measured between two electrodes (source and drain), which is similar to a MOSFET Id-Vds family of curves where channel current is dependent on gate voltage. The operational mechanism of this transistor was investigated through materials modifications wherein Sn was replaced with W, Cr, C, Ti, Cu, and Al.  The optical properties and Raman spectra of each material were used to investigate metal bonding within the Ge2Se3 -Metal cosputtered material.",
