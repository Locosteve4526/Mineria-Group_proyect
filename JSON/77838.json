        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;This presentation to colleagues in the College of Education, delivered by Katie Conley, explored the integration of Data-Based Decision Making (DBDM) in Tiered Social/Emotional/Cultural/Behavioral (SECB) supports within educational settings. It highlighted the importance of embedding efficient monitoring systems into daily routines to empower educators and enhance the quality of professional decisions. The session covered critical frameworks such as Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) and the role of DBDM in improving educational outcomes. Conley shared her insights as a special educator and implementation scientist, emphasizing the need for gradual change, effective collaboration, and robust professional development in the face of challenges in educational practices. The presentation also outlined findings from a pilot study that analyzed the use of PBISApps for monitoring behavioral interventions, identifying areas for improvement in implementation fidelity. Conley advocated for alternative models to traditional coaching, focusing on collaborative support mechanisms that fostered educator growth and ultimately improved student outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
