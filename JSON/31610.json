        "Description/Abstract": "The unexpected discoveries of hundreds of exoplanets very close to their host stars have challenged planet formation theories. The most extreme subset of these are the ultra-short-period planets, or USPs, with orbital periods of less than a day. These planets may provide unprecedented insights into planet formation and evolution and serve as sensitive probes for planet-star interactions and the stellar wind. Given their very short periods, such planets are particularly amenable to discovery by the Kepler, K2, and upcoming TESS missions and follow-up efforts. In this presentation, we will discuss our group\u2019s ongoing search for ultra-short-period planets, the SuPerPiG effort. We will present our follow-up work and an updated list of candidates from our project, including a system with two small candidate planets, one with a period of about 13 hours and the other with a period of about 13 days.
