        "Description/Abstract": "This is a nationwide collaborarion among 7-8 burrowing owl researchers that possess sufficient demographic data to perform an integrated population model for this species. The effort is being spearheaded by Brian Milsap, former US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Martha Desmond, Univ. of New Mexico. We held a symposium at the 2023 annual meeting of the Raptor Research Foundation to compile and share the needed data and information to perform the effort. There was a postdoc hired in 2024 to head up the paper writing. The group of principals will decide where the manuscript goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LIkely authors include Courtney Conway Univ of Idaho, Lynne Trulio San Jose State University, Troy Wellicome Canadian Wildlife Service, Martha Desmond Univ. of New Mexico, Brian Milsap US Fish and Wildlife Service, David Johnson Global Owl project, Collen Wisinski San Diego Zoo, and a handful of others. This is in progress.",
