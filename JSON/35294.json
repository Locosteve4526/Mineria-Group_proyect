        "Description/Abstract": "Civil legal aid, which includes provision of legal services for indigent and low-income individuals, is a promising but underfunded and underexplored avenue for reducing intimate partner violence (IPV) and its devastating effects.  Recent research indicates that providing civil counsel in divorce, custody, and protective order proceedings can significantly improve outcomes for IPV victims and their children as well as serve as a cost-effective strategy for reducing violence and generating positive social returns.  This note summarizes extant research on civil legal aid and its applications for IPV victims and concludes with suggestions for improving service delivery and research in the field.",
