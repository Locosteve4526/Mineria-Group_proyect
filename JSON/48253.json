        "Description/Abstract": "Salmonella enterica Typhimurium strain DT104 is a common source of salmonella that causes gastroenteritis in humans and bovines. DT104 contains a toxin that resembles other AB5 type toxins antigenically and structurally. In order to prevent the spread of this strain, an improved vaccine for bovines is being researched and developed. The toxin from DT104, called ArtAB, is hypothesized to behave like other AB5 toxins. ArtAB has successfully been purified and the long term goal is to comprehensively characterize its activity using tissue culture and the mouse model. For this project, large batches of ArtAB and ArtAB-HIS were purified for the tissue culture and mouse studies. In addition, new plasmid vectors were constructed to express ArtB subunit alone and to express a fluorescent A2/B. Purified ArtB will be used to determine the activity of this subunit and fluorescent A2/B will be used for observation of cellular trafficking in tissue cells. Lastly, RNA was purified from S. Typhimurium DT104 grown in broth, to perform RT-PCR on cDNA and quantify the expression of ArtAB in a laboratory setting. These studies will help to define the activity and contribution of this toxin to Salmonella disease with the goal of developing a new vaccine. \n",
