        "Description/Abstract": "In this conceptual piece, we review the strengths and weaknesses of portfolio models in the field of purchasing. We argue that 2x2 portfolio models hinder researchers\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 ability to improve sourcing strategy formulation. We propose that using a configurational theory can help removing most of the weaknesses commonly attributed to portfolio models. Consequently, we introduce a typology of ideal sourcing strategies and propose that a congruent alignment around one of these ideal types can improve purchasing performance. The dimensions considered in the description of ideal types include product and market characteristics as well as the coordination mechanisms used in the relationship, including power and trust.",
