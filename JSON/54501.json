        "Description/Abstract": "Routine Activity Theory has been repeatedly tested as an explanation for a variety of criminal behaviors. Environmental and spatial theories of crime have also been of increasing interest. Reported incidents of sex-related crimes against minors were mapped using spatial software, tested for clustering, and run through a multivariate spatially-lagged regression to determine the applicability of Routine Activity Theory. The probability of clustering in areas with less guardianship was investigated using a lack of guardianship measure from census data. The results suggest ways for law enforcement agencies to focus limited resources and identify spatial influence on the occurrence of these crimes.",
