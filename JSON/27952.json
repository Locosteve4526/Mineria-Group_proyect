        "Description/Abstract": "The authors propose a new approach for constructing perfectly matched layers (PMLs) for time-dependent scalar anisotropic wave equations in convex polygonal domains by introducing a modified wave equation and formulating general perfectly matched transmission conditions. The existence of solutions without parasitic reflections is discussed for specific transmission problems and generalized stability criteria are proved for the time domain problem. The authors derive PMLs for anisotropic acoustic problems in convex polygonal media and present numerical experiments after applying an algorithm that uses high order finite elements and mortar elements. Their numerical results, presented in two and three spacial dimensions, demonstrate the efficiency of their approach.\nExplanation of Other:  Mathematical Reviews",
