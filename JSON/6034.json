        "Description/Abstract": "We showed that metacomprehension accuracy improved when participants (N = 87  college students) wrote summaries of texts prior to judging their  comprehension; however, accuracy only improved when summaries were  written after a delay, not when written immediately after reading. We  evaluated two hypotheses proposed to account for this  delayed-summarization effect (the accessibility hypothesis and the  situation model hypothesis). The data suggest that participants based  metacomprehension judgments more on the gist of texts when they  generated summaries after a delay; whereas, they based judgments more on  details when they generated summaries immediately after reading.  Focusing on information relevant to the situation model of a text (the  gist of a text) produced higher levels of metacomprehension accuracy,  which is consistent with situation model hypothesis.",
