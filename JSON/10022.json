        "Description/Abstract": "This paper addresses the application of Yosso\u2019s (2005) Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) framework to study refugee access and achievement within higher education. This paper explores how this framework was used to analyze qualitative data on refugee students who are either attending higher education at a four-year institution or a community college or have graduated. Additionally, the paper will offer new insights that extend Yosso\u2019s conceptualization of community cultural wealth advancing the discourse regarding the experiences of refugee collegians.",
