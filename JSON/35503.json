        "Description/Abstract": "Numerous computer science programs are moving online, and addressing the replacement of in-person laboratory experiences with authentic and cost-effective methods is therefore necessary. Traditionally, static models such as schematic diagrams along with detailed textual descriptions have been used. This study explored the use of a logic simulation tool as an interventional assignment in an online undergraduate computer science course. Three iterations of the intervention were run using a design-based research approach.",
