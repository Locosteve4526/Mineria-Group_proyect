        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;The world is in the midst of a quantum gold rush with global investment hitting $2.3 billion in 2023. The US and China lead many aspects of this not yet fully existing technology and are increasingly coming into conflict on possible paths of development. In this paper, I will define quantum computing as an emerging technology (Rotolo et al, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link-springer-com.libproxy.boisestate.edu/article/10.1007/s11192-022-04478-4#ref-CR76&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;) that is developing in the context of possible decoupling, competition, or collaboration responses and analyze how these different policy responses can yield different futures for this industry.&lt;/span&gt;",
