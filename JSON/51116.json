This workshop examines the current state of undergraduate students\u2019 critical inquiry skills as demonstrated by the Albertsons Library micro-credential taken by all University Foundations students since Fall 2018. It will also include practical solutions for reinforcing these foundational critical inquiry skills in other first-year student classrooms. Participants are encouraged to have a syllabus or course assignment available to use with the accompanying worksheet to brainstorm critical inquiry integrations that create a coherent and connected flow to this essential aspect of student learning.",
