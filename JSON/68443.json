        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;jats:p&gt;This article foregrounds the experiences of &lt;jats:italic&gt;graduate(d) student athletes&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, defined as college athletes who earn a bachelor\u2019s degree before exhausting their athletic eligibility and take postbaccalaureate or graduate coursework. Findings from semistructured phone interviews with 11 graduate(d) student athletes in Division I football suggest participants are able to marshal their academic credentials to negotiate stereotypes. Examining how simultaneously being a graduate(d) student and a football player impacted participants\u2019 vulnerability to stereotyping, I find that despite the ability to disrupt stereotypes, obstacles both systemic and individual may inhibit this effect. In particular, I explore the themes: &lt;jats:italic&gt;stereotyping, disrupting/disproving stereotyping, trailblazer/role model&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, and &lt;jats:italic&gt;invisibility&lt;/jats:italic&gt;. I also attend to the factors contributing to this subpopulation of college athletes\u2019 continued invisibility and offer implications and suggestions for practice.&lt;/jats:p&gt;",
