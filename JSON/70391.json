        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;As one lesbian has suggested, about every 10 years, some event in Idaho occurs designed to put LGBTQ+ people \u201cin their place,\u201d ever since the infamous purge of homosexuals in 1955 known as the \u201cBoys of Boise.\u201d The public controversies up to the present day in this very Christian state are filled with religious messaging, much of it from religious leaders, unequivocally declaring Christian scripture\u2019s (and God\u2019s) condemnation of homosexuality/homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through three stories of LGBTQ+ clergy\u2014two gay men and one lesbian\u2014ordained in the Episcopal Church from the 1970s-2000s, this paper explores the intersections of religion and LGBTQ+ identity in Idaho at a very personal level through oral histories, interviews, and clerical records of the Episcopal Diocese of Idaho. More broadly, these sources provide insight into the struggle of one denomination\u2019s congregations and leaders--both gay and straight, both affirming and non-affirming--to consistently question their understanding of centuries of theology to confront their own history of discrimination and forge a path toward personal and institutional acceptance and encouragement of LGBTQ+ leadership and inclusion. It provides an important counter-narrative to traditional understandings of Christians\u2019 persecution of LGBTQ+ people in Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;",
