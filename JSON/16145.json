        "Description/Abstract": "Atlanta is known for its Civil Rights leaders, yet less is known about the leadership roles of their wives. Jean Childs Young, wife of Andrew Young, thought of herself less as Andrew\u2019s wife and more as his partner as she supported him through his numerous roles as a minister, civil rights leader, politician, and public figure. She did not limit herself to her role as a wife and mother, and she provided community and international leadership as a teacher and activist for civil rights, children\u2019s rights, and education. This presentation explores Jean\u2019s role as a wife, mother, and activist and how her personal papers document her activities, providing new insight into the unexplored life of a prominent African-American woman both in and beyond the South.",
