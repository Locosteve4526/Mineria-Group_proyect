        "Description/Abstract": "From educational gaming through portable e-readers to cell phones, media are interpenetrating educational spaces and activities. Accordingly, understanding media in environmental or ecological terms has become increasingly important for education on both sides of the Atlantic. In North America, the recent centenary of McLuhan\u2019s birth has focused attention on approaches to media \u2013whether oral, textual, electronic or digital-- as a kind of environment in which education takes place. On the other side, the so-called \u201cmediatic turn\u201d \u2013following on the linguistic and iconic turns\u2014has similarly emphasized the role of media as a condition for the possibility of educational activities and programs. The purpose of this conference is to deepen and expand international dialogue between North America and the UK, and Northern and German-speaking Europe in the area of educational media -- and to provide an opportunity for developing connections to other contexts as well. Areas of research and scholarship relevant to this dialogue include educational media, media literacy, educational technology, educational philosophy, and literary and cultural studies.\r\nExplanation of Other:  Special Journal Issue",
