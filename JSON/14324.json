        "Description/Abstract": "The Santiaguito Volcano complex in Guatemala has been continuously active since 1922, with eruptive activity centered at the Caliente dome since 1967. Multi-sensor studies carried out in 2007, 2009, and 2012 indicate that explosions have become less frequent and more intense during the past five years. Seismic events recorded at Santiaguito include explosive degassing, block and ash flows, and tremor. Source processes often occur simultaneously, producing signals which can be difficult to interpret. Time lapse photography collected in 2012 allows discrimination of rockfalls and explosions within the seismic record. Photogrammetry of the 2012 dome indicates lava flow velocities on the order of 10 m per hour and local inflation/deflation of ~1 m per minute. Seismic data from 2012 contain several distinct recurring waveforms, which in this study are characterized according to spectral content and other parameters. Source processes for these waveforms are identified using a combination of methods with emphasis on seismic and optical observations. We use data from the more comprehensive 2012 deployment to inform interpretation of previously collected seismic data. Events over the 2007-2012 period are catalogued according to selected criteria. Using statistical analyses, we identify variations in seismic activity between the three deployments, and discuss implications for eruptive processes at Santiaguito.",
