Dr. Ellertson and his team will discuss the pedagogical implications of serious gaming for training nursing students with an emphasis on economical VR educational systems.  Dr. Breitkreuz will discuss implications of using VR systems for deliberate repetitive practice in nurses training and for just-in-time refreshing and remediation.  She will also share preliminary results from the international trial and usability study on the VR Sterile Catheter Game, and discuss implications for future research and development.  This immersive session will also provide users with the opportunity to enter the virtual environment and experience haptic interactions as they attempt to perform this vital nursing skill.\r\n",
