        "Description/Abstract": "U-Nb alloys are of interest in defense applications and are potential metallic\nreactor fuels. However, long term aging and other thermal excursions impact\nthe corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of interest in these\nindustries. This research focuses on the kinetic competition between general\nprecipitation (GP) and discontinuous precipitation (DP) mechanisms, which subsequently\ninfluences further decomposition during aging. Samples aged at 600\\\\176;C\nfor 10, 30, and 100 minutes were investigated by atom probe tomography within\nboth GP and DP structures. Previous atom probe results indicate that the GP\nprecipitates have strong Nb partitioning (~0 at.% Nb within precipitates)\nand have coalesced at longer aging times. New results from the DP reaction will\nbe presented, along with a comparison to x-ray diffraction and neutron scattering\nstudies. The Nb distribution inside of and between GP and DP structures is\nused to gain insight into the details of the growth kinetics.\n",
