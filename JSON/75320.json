        "Description/Abstract": "            &lt;span&gt;Background: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Understanding sexual behavior and its determinants among college students is crucial for promoting sexual health and well-being. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) may play a role in shaping sexual behaviors. The current study investigates the association between ACEs, condom use frequency, demographics, and consensual sexual intercourse among college students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Methods: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon IRB approval, a paper survey was administered among undergraduate college students enrolled in the Health Promotion and Education classes at a midwestern urban campus. A total of 152 participants were recruited through convenient sampling. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A univariate regression analysis to examine the association between sexual intercourse and categories of ACEs, age, condom use frequency, and sex assigned at birth. Females were approximately four times more likely to report more than 2 categories of ACEs (95% CI [1.553, 8.044]). Furthermore, a final logistic regression model was significant (\u03c7\u00b2 = 114.666, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; = 2, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt; .001). Age (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; = .031, Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.982) and condom use frequency (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt; .001, Adjusted Odds Ratio = 5.579) were significant predictors of sexual intercourse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Conclusion: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The current findings highlight the importance of considering ACEs, age, and condom use habits when addressing sexual health among college students. Tailored interventions should focus on promoting safe sexual practices and addressing the impact of childhood experiences on sexual behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;        ",
