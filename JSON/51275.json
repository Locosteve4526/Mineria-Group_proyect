        "Description/Abstract": "Mary Oliver\u2019s Debt to Emerson&lt;br&gt;In 2000 Mary Oliver published an introduction to a volume of Emerson\u2019s work. His impact on her writing and imagination is significant, though her poetic voice is distinctly her own. One aspect of Oliver\u2019s debt to Emerson is evident in the Whitmanic strain in her writing. Oliver writes that Whitman\u2019s \u201cwords,\u201d are \u201ca spiritual and a physical touching\u201d (Upstream 104). Such dualism courses throughout the writing of Oliver, Whitman, and Emerson. Even though all these writers cherish the physical world for itself, they also view it as an embodiment of the spiritual. In a rare interview, Oliver expresses this Emersonian idea to Renee Olander: \u201cThe world of nature is the great warehouse of our figurative language.\u201d&lt;br&gt;In Nature, Emerson famously writes of his dramatic union with the natural world, portraying himself as a \u201ctransparent eyeball\u201d to emphasize his transcendent connection to the universe. Oliver is less grandiose, but she takes the spiritual just as seriously as he does. In her essay \u201cPerfect Days,\u201d for instance, she attests to a spiritual union with the natural world, but unlike Emerson she valorizes the ordinary (Long Life 32-34). She even prefers it to the extraordinary as the token of the authentic. Nevertheless, she shares Emerson\u2019s commitment to the epiphanies of nature. Indeed, attentiveness to the natural world is a key link between Oliver and Emerson. For Oliver, Ezra Pound\u2019s claim rings true: \u201cthe natural object is always the adequate symbol.\u201d",
