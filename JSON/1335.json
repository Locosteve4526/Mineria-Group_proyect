        "Description/Abstract": "We are facing an unparalleled decline in our environment, our health, and our society. Given our world, it is easy to get a little gloomy about, well, just about everything. Such thoughts often lead to feeling disconnected with your local community, and this feeling of isolation will eventually impact your work and your personal life. However, volunteering can help you reconnect with your community, return the balance to your life, and restore our planet.",
