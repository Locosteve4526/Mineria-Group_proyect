        "Description/Abstract": "Security policy compliance is an important part of the success of an organization\u2019s security initiative. Yet, how users respond to and more importantly behave when educated about these policies are in place is under-studied. This paper proposes a model that incorporates the effects of user intentions and attitudes on compliance. We use a simulation to test a part of the proposed model by examining the effect that threat appraisal, intention to comply and education have on complying behavior. An algorithm outlining a framework for testing an aspect of the model is given, along with the state and output variables. The simulation results show that compliance behavior can be modeled successfully and simulations based on environmental as well as policy factors can be integrated for study. Several avenues for future research based on the proposed model are provided at the end of the paper.",
