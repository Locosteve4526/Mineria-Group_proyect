        "Description/Abstract": "This biographical narrative is a detailed portrayal of the life and  career of the first Christian emperor Constantine the Great (273 \u2013 337).  Combining vivid narrative and historical analysis, Charles Odahl  relates the rise of Constantine amid the crises of the late Roman world,  his dramatic conversion to and public patronage of Christianity, and  his church building programs in Rome, Jerusalem and Constantinople which  transformed the pagan state of Roman antiquity into the Christian  empire medieval Byzantium.\nThe author's comprehensive knowledge of the literary sources and his  extensive research into the material remains of the period mean that  this volume provides a more rounded and accurate portrait of Constantine  than previously available.\nA landmark publication in Roman Imperial, early Christian, and  Byzantine history, Constantine and the Christian Empire will remain the  standard account of the subject for years to come.",
