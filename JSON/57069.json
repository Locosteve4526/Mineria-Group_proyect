        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of burnout occurrence among health science faculty at a higher education institution and their self-reported perception of well-being. The design of the study was cross-sectional, descriptive survey research. An electronic questionnaire was developed measuring the constructs of burnout and well-being. The Qualtrics \u00ae platform was used to distribute the survey to all full-time faculty within the College of Health Sciences. Significant differences were observed in the extent of burnout and perception of wellbeing between faculty members who had clinical teaching responsibilities within their faculty role compared to those who did not, p=0.005, Partial Eta Squared =0.318. Faculty who had a 9-month contract appointment had significantly lower OLBI-D scores (p=0.024) and OLBI-Full scores (p=0.047) compared with those who had another length of contract. There was a significantly negative relationship between the extent of burnout and perception of wellbeing. In this small sample of health science faculty (45 respondents from nursing, community and environmental health, kinesiology, social work, respiratory care, allied health sciences, and radiologic sciences), burnout, as characterized by increased exhaustion and disengagement, was moderately prevalent and associated with poorer well-being.
