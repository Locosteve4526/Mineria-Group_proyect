        "Description/Abstract": "A burgeoning literature has documented the impact of adjunct faculty employment on student success and interest, but very little is known about its underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate instructor choice of grading standards as one mediating channel by exploiting a unique university policy that converts full-time permanent lecturer from existing part-time temporary instructors. Our results suggest that instructors that are hired on a temporary, part-time basis assign higher grades than their permanent full-time counterparts, with no discernible differences in student learning outcomes. The differential grading standards, however, have a non-negligible impact on student enrollment patterns. More lenient grading significantly increases the likelihood of a student enrolling in a second course and the total number of credit hours taken within the subject, especially among first- and second-year students, low-ability students, females, and those taking course from academic (as opposed to professional) subjects.",
