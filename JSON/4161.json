        "Description/Abstract": "Prestack depth migration (PSDM) analysis has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of both shallow seismic reflection images and the measured velocity distributions. In a study designed to image faults in the Alvord Basin, Oregon, at depths from 25\u20131000 m, PSDM produced a detailed reflection image over the full target depth range. In contrast, poststack time migration produced significant migration artifacts in the upper 100 m that obscured reflection events and limited the structural interpretation in the shallow section. Additionally, an abrupt increase from ~2500 to &gt;3000 m/s in the PSDM velocity model constrained the interpretation of the transition from sedimentary basin fill to basement volcanic rocks. PSDM analysis revealed a complex extensional history with at least two distinct phases of basin growth and a midbasin basement high that forms the division between two major basin compartments.",
