        "Description/Abstract": "We demonstrate that a device composed of sputtered amorphous chalcogenide Ge 2 Se 3 /M +\nGe 2 Se 3  (M = Sn or Cu) alternating layers functions as an optically gated transistor (OGT) and can\nbe used as an access transistor for a memristor memory element. This transistor has only two\nelectrically connected terminals (source and drain), with the gate being optically controlled, thus\nallowing the transistor to operate only in the presence of light (385\u20131200 nm). The switching\nspeed of the OGTs is &lt;15 \u03bcs. The OGT is demonstrated in series with a Ge 2 Se 3  + W memristor,\nwhere we show that by altering the light intensity on the OGT gate, the memristor can be\nprogrammed to a continuous range of nonvolatile memory states using the saturation current of\nthe OGT as a programming compliance current. By having a continuous range of nonvolatile\nstates, one memory cell can potentially achieve 2 n  levels. This high density, combined with\noptical programmability, enables hybrid electronic/photonic memory.\n",
