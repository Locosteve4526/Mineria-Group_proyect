        "Description/Abstract": "Academic internships have long been an important component of many students' college education. Although internship programs have been around for over a century at some colleges, the importance of the academic internship has increased significantly in the past few years (Coco 2000). Employers today are seeking to hire people who can jump into a position and make an immediate contribution. They expect new hires to not only have a solid academic background but also workplace experience related to their profession. Students who have both are in demand.",
