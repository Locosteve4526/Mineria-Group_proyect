        "Description/Abstract": "The dismal results of standard physics teaching found in the research in physics education are explained and justified by the folk theory of physics teaching. Challenging this folk theory at its core results in far superior student learning. An example of an alternative practice called student understanding-driven instruction is described. Implications for the role of the teacher and for teacher preparation are drawn, as are challenges to engaging in this alternative physics teaching practice.",
