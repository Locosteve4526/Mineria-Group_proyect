        "Description/Abstract": "\t\nClass size has been a popular topic in education for decades. There is renewed interest in this topic now with the growth and demand for online courses and programs. Online courses can easily accommodate hundreds, if not thousands, of students in a single course. Very little research, though, has been conducted recently on class size in online courses and the research that has been conducted is mixed. As the demand for online courses increases, so likely will class size. Each year faculty find themselves teaching online courses with higher enrollments. In this exploratory study, we investigated the perceptions and experiences of faculty teaching high enrollment online courses. In the following article, we report the results of our inquiry, implications for practice, and areas for additional research.",
