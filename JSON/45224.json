        "Description/Abstract": "Listening carefully to our students and integrating the variables that matter to them is a step that we can take to increase the number of women and underrepresented minority graduates in engineering. This paper shares an evaluative case study as we report findings from the data gathering tools guiding our continuous improvement process. The findings illuminate students\u2019 perceptions of their engineering design course and curriculum. We conclude by discussing the pedagogical decisions the teaching team is making as a result of their voices. \n",
