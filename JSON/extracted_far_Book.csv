The Catholic Church in the 21st century wrestles with expanding opportunities for laypeople to participate in ministry, sacrament, and leadership of the Church, particularly over whether women should be ordained to the priesthood and whether laypeople should be given greater roles in liturgy. Some Catholics welcome such possibilities. Others fear that changes in traditional practices will weaken the foundations of the Church, the family, and society. 

The Catholic Church faced a similar challenge after English King Henry VIII’s break with Rome in 1534. For almost 300 years, Catholicism was illegal throughout the British Isles. In the absence of churches, priests, and sacraments, Catholics broadened gender and religious roles to meet their spiritual needs within an underground faith. The intervening three centuries allegedly fostered a world of bad Catholics with divided loyalties between church, state, society, and the family: scandalous “galloping nuns,” “Apostolic Viragoes,” and “false” and “traitorous” Catholic “rogues.” 

This book explores how Catholics experimented with new understandings of women’s and men’s roles in family life, ritual, religious leadership, and vocation in their quest to be both good Catholics and good subjects. Engaging personal narratives, letters, trial records, and other stories reveal how far ordinary Catholics would go to get their needs met and how far the Catholic Church would bend its rules on gender and laypeoples' roles in the Church to sustain beleaguered Catholics in a Protestant land. In the many generations that passed between Henry VIII’s break with the Roman Catholic Church and Catholic emancipation in the British Isles in 1829, Catholics had time to set limits, loosen them, and face the consequences. The lessons learned inform our contemporary discussion not only about women’s and men’s natural and God-given roles but also about divine power and authority itself.

He focuses on the role that science and scientists played in both defining the acid rain problem as one worthy of policy consideration and in framing the acid rain issue in a way that would prompt action to reduce pollution levels.A major concern of Alm's study are the problems scientists have in connecting to the policy side of environmental debates. He provides in-depth exchanges from the floor of Congress between scientists and policy makers as they debated the merits of reducing acid rain pollution. These exchanges provide special insight into the difficulty that scientists have in communicating the findings of their research to policy makers and the public. In addition, he uses in-depth interviews with the acid-rain scientists themselves to delineate the way they perceive how science is and ought to be linked to the policy world. Finally, Alm looks at the different perspectives offered by United States scientists versus Canadian scientists and natural scientists versus social scientists, and he examines the importance and implications of these differences to the future of environmental policy making in the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Praeger,,,,"Crossing Borders, Crossing Boundaries: The Role of Scientists in the U.S.-Canadian Acid Rain Debate",,,,Praeger,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/213,,[],"[{""id"": 23363, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2000, ""termid"": ""1999/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Alm, L.

By what mechanisms does it do so in the United States and other  liberal democracies? How can scientists most effectively discharge  their duty as citizens and public trustees to ensure that environmental  policymaking in the United States is scientifically sound?These  are the key questions that this primary textbook for courses on American  public policymaking and environmental policymaking addresses and  attempts to answer. Turmoil in American Public Policy: Science,  Democracy, and the Environment first lays out the basics of the  policymaking process in the United States in relation to the substantive  issues of environmental policymaking. Drawing on hundreds of  interviews, the authors highlight the views and experiences of  scientists, especially natural scientists, in their interactions with  policymakers and their efforts to harness the findings of their science  to rational public policy. The proper role of science and  scientists in relation to environmental policymaking hinges on  fundamental questions at the intersection of political philosophy and  scientific epistemology. How can the experimental nature of the  scientific method and the probabilistic expression of scientific results  be squared with the normative language of legislation and regulation?  If scientists undertake to square the circle by hardening the tentative  truths of their scientific models into positive truths to underpin  public policy, at what point may they be judged to have exceeded the  proper limits of scientific knowledge, relinquished their role as  impartial experts, and become partisan advocates demanding too much say  in a democratic setting? Providing students—and secondarily  policymakers, scientists, and citizen activists—a theoretical and  practical knowledge of the means availed by modern American democracy  for resolving this tension is the object of this progressively  structured textbook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,"ABC-CLIO, LLC",,,,"Turmoil in American Public Policy: Science, Democracy, and the Environment",,,,"ABC-CLIO, LLC",,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/2,,[],"[{""id"": 23364, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2010, ""termid"": ""2009/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Alm, L.

It treats research, revision, and critical reading skills (of both texts and visuals) as organic components of every writing process.

By what mechanisms does it do so in the United States and other  liberal democracies? How can scientists most effectively discharge  their duty as citizens and public trustees to ensure that environmental  policymaking in the United States is scientifically sound?These  are the key questions that this primary textbook for courses on American  public policymaking and environmental policymaking addresses and  attempts to answer. Turmoil in American Public Policy: Science,  Democracy, and the Environment first lays out the basics of the  policymaking process in the United States in relation to the substantive  issues of environmental policymaking. Drawing on hundreds of  interviews, the authors highlight the views and experiences of  scientists, especially natural scientists, in their interactions with  policymakers and their efforts to harness the findings of their science  to rational public policy. The proper role of science and  scientists in relation to environmental policymaking hinges on  fundamental questions at the intersection of political philosophy and  scientific epistemology. How can the experimental nature of the  scientific method and the probabilistic expression of scientific results  be squared with the normative language of legislation and regulation?  If scientists undertake to square the circle by hardening the tentative  truths of their scientific models into positive truths to underpin  public policy, at what point may they be judged to have exceeded the  proper limits of scientific knowledge, relinquished their role as  impartial experts, and become partisan advocates demanding too much say  in a democratic setting? Providing students—and secondarily  policymakers, scientists, and citizen activists—a theoretical and  practical knowledge of the means availed by modern American democracy  for resolving this tension is the object of this progressively  structured textbook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,"ABC-CLIO, LLC",,,,"Turmoil in American Public Policy: Science, Democracy, and the Environment",,,,"ABC-CLIO, LLC",,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/2,,[],"[{""id"": 24094, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2010, ""termid"": ""2009/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Alm, L.

Topic #1012 is a state-by-state examination of each state's specific definition of a unitary business as it
applies to corporate taxpayers. The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution limits the ability of states to tax the income of multistate corporations. A state may only tax an apportioned share of income earned by a unitary business with a sufficient connection to the state. A multistate corporation (or affiliated group of corporations) doing business in a state must determine
which of its operations are in the same unitary business as its in-state activities. Most of the guidance comes from U.S. Supreme Court opinions interpreting the Due Process Clause in the context of state corporate taxation. Topic #1012 reviews those opinions-which provide general, nationwide guidance-and then summarizes each state's specific definition of a unitary business through statutes,rulings, court opinions, or other authorities.

What happens when narrative authority fails and, just as importantly, why does it? As a means to answering these questions, Wandering Women in French Film and Literature examines the phenomenon of 'narrative drift' through in-depth analysis of twentieth-century novels and films. Combining feminist theories and structural narratology, Devereux Herbeck illustrates the ways in which evidence and/or admissions of doubt by narrative entities in works featuring wandering women disrupt conventions of continuity, coherence, and authority and thereby forces the story in new, unexpected directions.

Iconoclastic directors and production teams-including Virgil Thomson, the Living Theatre, the Judson Poets Theatre, the Santa Fe Opera, the Glimmerglass Opera, the Wooster Group, Robert Wilson, Anne Bogart, Frank Galati and Heiner Goebbels-have ardently roamed Stein's spare dramatic ""landscapes,"" but even these convention-defying artists had to fill some of her absences in order to bring the texts to life on stage. Inevitably contemporary culture infiltrates Stein's pristine topography via these extra-textual additions, transforming it in ways virtually unimaginable when the reader encounters the text on the printed page. It is only by mapping the intersections of written text, performance text, and context, that one can gain a full appreciation of what Stein's dramatic writing has meant at various historical moments, how she herself has been imagined, and how her writing has transformed the landscape of the American alternative theater.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Palgrave Macmillan,,,,"Staging Gertrude Stein: Absence, Culture, and the Landscape of American Alternative Theatre",,,,Palgrave Macmillan,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/224,,[],"[{""id"": 24531, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2005, ""termid"": ""2004/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Durham, L.

Its governance and role in civic life, education, and entertainment are all still openly disputed and debated. The issues include censorship and network control, privacy and surveillance, the political impact of activist blogging, peer to peer file sharing, the effects of video games on children, and many others. Media conglomerates, governments and users all contribute to shaping the forms and functions of the Internet as the limits and potentialities of the technologies are tested and extended. What is most surprising about the Internet is the proliferation of controversies and conflicts in which the creativity of ordinary users plays a central role. The title, (Re)Inventing the Internet, refers to this extraordinary flowering of agency in a society that tends to reduce its members to passive spectators. This collection presents a series of critical case studies that examine specific sites of change and contestation. These cover a range of phenomena including computer gaming cultures, online education, surveillance, and the mutual shaping of digital technologies and civic life.

Johnson spent sixteen years behind bars before he was freed in 1999 after DNA testing conclusively proved him not guilty. ""Exit to Freedom"" is the unforgettable story of Johnson's unrelenting quest for justice against incredible odds and under circumstances that threatened to shred his dignity and hope. As Johnson recalls his trial and long journey toward freedom through five Georgia prisons, he speaks candidly about everything from his middle-class childhood in Atlanta to the reasons he became a rape suspect to the steadfast support of his family. However disturbed readers may become by this portrait of a justice system undermined by its own cynicism, Johnson feels no bitterness toward his accusers.

In this book, editors R. Eric Landrum and Maureen McCarthy identify four broad areas of concern in the ethical teaching of undergraduate psychology: pedagogy, student behavior, faculty behavior toward students, and considerations in the diverse classroom. Together with their team of experts, they provide evidence-based advice and case studies that illustrate the application of relevant ethical principles. Ethical teachers need to reflect on commonly accepted practices and make individual decisions about responsible teaching behaviors, such as honoring individual differences and respectfully challenging beliefs. Other challenges examined in this book include grading, textbook adoption, honor systems, online instruction, and conducting and using research on pedagogy to improve classroom practice. Infusing the undergraduate experience with ethics is the focus of chapters on supervising student internships, coauthoring research with students, and modeling appropriate professional boundaries. Readers will find a host of practical suggestions for approaching ethics proactively in both traditional and virtual classrooms.

The approach of this book is applied—to provide students with practical, timely, up-to-date information. This text standardizes and catalogs much of the practical advice that professors often give to students—providing tips on how to do well in all classes, how to find research ideas, and how to write papers in general APA format. Also, the book contains up-to-date career information that faculty might not normally have at their fingertips, including the latest salary figures for a number of psychology-related jobs and occupations.

Many of these refugees have been exposed to severe— and often repeated—trauma in conflict zones, including combat, torture, sexual violence, and destruction of property. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), perhaps not surprisingly, seems to be a particularly prevalent condition among these refugees. This book discusses how PTSD manifests itself, sometimes differentially, in refugees, and the best practices on how to screen for and diagnose it, as well as treating it in a culturally sensitive fashion.

The book chronicles the efforts of the defeated radical politician Lucius Sergius Catilina to bring together a group of disaffected Roman nobles and discontented Italian farmers in a conspiracy to overthrow the republican government at Rome and to take control of the Italian peninsula (while the proconsul Pompey the Great and the majority of Roman military units were campaigning in the Near East), and the success of the conservative optimate consul Marcus Tullius Cicero in uncovering the conspiracy, driving Catiline out of Rome, and defeating his revolutionary followers in the capital and in Etruria. The narrative reveals the political corruption, economic problems, and military instability which were leading to the demise of the republican system and the rise of an imperial government in the first century B.C.
The author’s comprehensive knowledge of the ancient sources and the modern scholarship relevant to the last century of the republic has allowed him to offer a detailed and definitive account of this important episode in Roman history. In the same seamless combination of vivid narrative and historical analysis through which he enlightened the Roman imperial age of Constantine, Dr. Odahl here illuminates the Roman republican era of Cicero. This book is a significant publication in Ciceronian studies and will become the standard account of the Catilinarian Conspiracy.""",,,,,,,9.78042E+12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Routledge,New York,,,Cicero and the Catilinarian Conspiracy,,,,,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/9,,[],"[{""id"": 26321, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2010, ""termid"": ""2010/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Odahl, C.

The book chronicles the efforts of the defeated radical politician Lucius Sergius Catilina to bring together a group of disaffected Roman nobles and discontented Italian farmers in a conspiracy to overthrow the republican government at Rome and to take control of the Italian peninsula (while the proconsul Pompey the Great and the majority of Roman military units were campaigning in the Near East), and the success of the conservative optimate consul Marcus Tullius Cicero in uncovering the conspiracy, driving Catiline out of Rome, and defeating his revolutionary followers in the capital and in Etruria. The narrative reveals the political corruption, economic problems, and military instability which were leading to the demise of the republican system and the rise of an imperial government in the first century B.C.
The author's comprehensive knowledge of the ancient sources and the modern scholarship relevant to the last century of the republic has allowed him to offer a detailed and definitive account of this important episode in Roman history. In the same seamless combination of vivid narrative and historical analysis through which he enlightened the Roman imperial age of Constantine, Dr. Odahl here illuminates the Roman republican era of Cicero.

26334,111643332,111643332,,2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Owing to the decline of his contemporary fame and to decades of posthumous neglect, Herman Melville remains enigmatic to readers despite his status as one of America’s most securely canonical authors. Born into patrician wealth but plunged into poverty as a child, in 1840 he signed aboard the whaleship Acushnet in the midst of a nationwide depression and sailed to the South Pacific. At the Marquesas Islands, he deserted and lived for a time among one of the group’s last unsubjugated tribes. Upon his return home, he achieved overnight success with a book based on his experiences, Typee (1846).

Melville’s mastery of the English language and heterodox views made him a source of both controversy and fascination to western readers, until his increasing commitment to artistry and contempt for artificial conventions led him to write Moby-Dick (1851) and its successor Pierre (1852). Although the former is considered his masterwork today, the books offended mid-nineteenth-century cultural sensibilities and alienated Melville from the American literary marketplace. The resulting eclipse of his popular reputation was deepened by his voluntary withdrawal from society, so that obituaries written after his death in 1891 frequently expressed surprise that he hadn’t died long before.

With most of his personal papers and letters lost or destroyed, his library of marked and annotated books dispersed, and first-hand accounts of him scattered, brief, and frequently conflicting, Melville’s place in American literary scholarship illustrates the importance of accurately edited documents and the value of new information to our understanding of his life and thought. As a chronologically organized collection of surviving testimonials about the author, Melville in His Own Time continues the tradition of documentary research well-exemplified over the past half-century by the work of Jay Leyda, Merton M. Sealts, and Hershel Parker. Combining recently discovered evidence with new transcriptions of long-known but rarely consulted testimony, this collection offers the most up-to-date and correct record of commentary on Melville by individuals who knew him.

He shows how Aristotle developed an account of the nature of time that is inspired by Plato while also thoroughly bound up with Aristotle's sophisticated analyses of motion and perception. When Aristotle's view is properly understood, Roark argues, it is immune to devastating objections against the possibility of temporal passage articulated by McTaggart and other 20th century philosophers.

Many of these refugees have been exposed to severe— and often repeated—trauma in conflict zones, including combat, torture, sexual violence, and destruction of property. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), perhaps not surprisingly, seems to be a particularly prevalent condition among these refugees.

26686,111111683,111111683,,2000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Field-flow fractionation (FFF) occupies a unique niche in the field of analytical separations because it is the only technique that is capable of separating materials over the entire colloidal size range (1-1,000 nm) with high resolution. Still, FFF has not enjoyed what can be considered an explosive phase of growth, like those encountered in the development of gas and liquid chromatography. There are many theories as to why this is so, and certainly a combination of factors if responsible. FFF practitioners clearly agree that one hindrance to the widespread use of FFF as a routine tool for sizing macromolecules and colloids stems from its greatest asset. That asset is its versatility, and versatility comes with a price. Thus, even though FFF is applicable to an incredible range of materials, from macromolecules of a few thousand grams per mode or more to particles as large as 100 ?m, there is no simple formula for choosing the proper subtechnique, let alone the experimental variables within a given subtechnique for a given application. One must understand the underlying mechanism of the separation and gather a certain amount of experience to apply FFF to a new separation problem with reasonable success or efficiency. The goal of this handbook is to provide a useful guide to the implementation of FFF by first-time or infrequent users, while serving as a broad reference for more experienced FFF practitioners. In addressing this goal, than handbook contains a comprehensive description of the four primary FFF subtechniques, with specific examples and applications for each. Perhaps the greatest value, of this handbook lies in the fact that the authors are experts in the respective subtechniques that they address and so are able to advise the reader, from firsthand experience, on how to avoid certain pitfalls associated with developing and implementing FFF applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Wiley-Interscience,,,,Field Flow Fractionation Handbook,,,,Wiley-Interscience,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/285,,[],"[{""id"": 26686, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2000, ""termid"": ""1999/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Schimpf, M.

Behind this appeal lies an assumption that languages are selective in their development in ways that are dependent upon the communicative tasks to which they are put. As such, language function accounts for both variation and historical development over time.

The biosocial perspective is quite different. It assumes that biological and environmental factors interact to affect criminal behavior. Social environmental explanations have dominated the field of criminology for at least the past century. Supporters of this perspective argue that because criminal is an ever-changing legal designation, it makes no sense to believe that crimes are the result of biology. Biosocial theorists concede that criminality is a legal concept, but argue that at the core of the concept are acts that are recognized as unacceptable in all societies. The theme of this book is simple: Biology matters when trying to understand criminal behavior. This is not to exclude social factors but to maintain that social and biological factors interact to affect our varying tendencies to violate criminal statutes. Despite the conceptual simplicity of the biosocial perspective, the evidence that supports it is often complex and rests upon a number of biological principles that many criminologists do not understand. This book conveys some of the excitement that those working from a biosocial perspective are experiencing as they make new discoveries about how biological and social factors interact to affect criminal behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Nova Science Publishers,,,,Biosocial Criminology: Challenging Environmentalism's Supremacy,,,,Nova Science Publishers,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/91,,[],"[{""id"": 27477, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2003, ""termid"": ""2002/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Walsh, A.', 'Ellis, L.']"

27490,111110252,111110252,,2011.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The gender ratio problem (why always and everywhere males commit more criminal acts than females) has been called the single most important fact that criminology theories must be able to explain. Feminist criminology has attempted to do this for decades without success because it has relied on conceptual and theoretical tools from a single discipline — sociology.  A number of famous criminologists (e.g., Travis Hirschi) have concluded that an explanation of gender differences in crime from the sociological perspective may not be possible because it excludes biological sex, the powerful underlying base of gender. It is the contention of this book that unless feminist criminology comes to grips with the evolutionary and neurological bases of fundamental gender difference, the field will continue to flounder without compass.
A number of other influential criminologists (e.g., Francis Cullen) have concluded that the biosocial paradigm is the paradigm of the 21st century. The biosocial paradigm is growing in strength every year, as an examination of both the number of published books and articles in professional journals in criminology and other social and behavioral science disciplines will attest. This book looks at feminist criminology in general and attempts to explain its main concerns from a biosocial perspective while showing that there is nothing illiberal about it and that biology can be a very powerful ally to criminology.  The book ranges across disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, behavioral and molecular genetics, the neurosciences, and evolutionary biology to attempt to answer the gender ratio problem.  It is time to apply this exciting and robust paradigm — one that avers that any trait or behavior of any living thing is always the result of biological factors interacting with environmental factors — to the most vexing issues of feminist criminology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Carolina Academic Press,,,,Feminist Criminology through a Biosocial Lens,,,,Carolina Academic Press,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/90,,[],"[{""id"": 27490, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Walsh, A.']"

27497,111110252,111110252,,2011.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Social class has been at the forefront of sociological theories of crime from their inception. It is explicitly central to some theories such as anomie/strain and conflict, and nips aggressively at the periphery of others such as social control theory. Yet none of these theories engage in a systematic exploration of what social class is, how individuals come to be placed in one rung of the class ladder rather than another, or the precise nature of the class-crime relationship. This book avers that the same factors that help to determine a person's class level also help to determine that person's risk for committing criminal acts. Social class is a modern outcome of primordial status-striving and requires explanation using the modern tools of genetics, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology, and this is what this book does. Many aspects of criminal behavior can be understood by examining the shared factors that lead to the success or failure in the workplace and to pro- or antisocial activities.
A biosocial approach requires reducing sociology's ""master variable"" to a lower level analysis to examine its constituent parts, which is resisted by many criminologists as highly controversial. However, this book makes plain that the more we know about the nature side of behavior the more important we find the nurture side to be. It makes clear how the class/crime relationship and criminology in general, can benefit from the biosocial perspective; a perspective that many criminological luminaries expect to be the dominant paradigm for the twenty first century.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Routledge,,,,Social Class and Crime: A Biosocial Approach,,,,Routledge,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/24,,[],"[{""id"": 27497, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Walsh, A.']"

Perhaps the one receiving the most attention has been Participatory Budgeting (PB), first launched in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre in 1989 by a coalition of civil society activists and Workers' Party officials. PB quickly spread to more than 250 other municipalities in the country, and it has since been adopted in more than twenty countries worldwide. Most of the scholarly literature has focused on the successful case of Porto Alegre and has neglected to analyze how it fared elsewhere.
In this first rigorous comparative study of the phenomenon, Brian Wampler draws evidence from eight municipalities in Brazil to show the varying degrees of success and failure PB has experienced. He identifies why some PB programs have done better than others in achieving the twin goals of ensuring governmental accountability and empowering citizenship rights for the poor residents of these cities in the quest for greater social justice and a well-functioning democracy. Conducting extensive interviews, applying a survey to 650 PB delegates, doing detailed analysis of budgets, and engaging in participant observation, Wampler finds that the three most important factors explaining the variation are the incentives for mayoral administrations to delegate authority, the way civil society organizations and citizens respond to the new institutions, and the particular rule structure that is used to delegate authority to citizens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Pennsylvania State University Press,,,,"Participatory Budgeting in Brazil: Contestation, Cooperation, and Accountability",,,,Pennsylvania State University Press,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/75,,[],"[{""id"": 27531, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2007, ""termid"": ""2006/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Wampler, B.

How can adolescents connect their outside-of-school literacy to school purposes? How can we use the present instructional moment to encourage students to continue growing as readers and writers in the future? Michael Smith and Jeffrey Wilhelm have answers, and in Going with the Flow, they share new and powerful ways to build strong literacy habits in adolescent boys-and girls. Drawing on the research that won ""Reading Don't Fix No Chevys"" the NCTE David H. Russell Award, Smith and Wilhelm take Chevys out of the showroom onto the road, presenting classroom-tested units, lessons, and activities that get boys reading and writing and keep them involved in literacy learning. Going with the Flow fully illustrates their approach to designing and sequencing instruction, taking you from developing activities that prepare students for success before they are even given assignments to fostering meaningful classroom discussions. Even if you haven't read ""Reading Don't Fix No Chevys,"" Smith and Wilhelm provide a succinct summation of their research to get you started, then give you classroom transcripts, lesson-planning tips, and strategies for interacting with students to help you implement their ideas.

The methods are based on social-constructivist/socio-cultural theories of literacy learning, and incorporate research on literary response conducted by the authors. Teaching Literature to Adolescents--a totally new text that draws on ideas from the best selling textbook, Teaching Literature in the Secondary School, by Beach and Marshall--reflects and builds on recent key developments in theory and practice in the field, including: *the importance of providing students with a range of critical lenses for analyzing texts and interrogating the beliefs, attitudes, and ideological perspectives encountered in literature; *organization of the literature curriculum around topics, themes, or issues; *infusion of multicultural literature and emphasis on how writers portray race, class, and gender differences; *use of drama as a tool for enhancing understanding of texts; *employment of a range of different ways to write about literature; *integration of critical analysis of film and media texts with the study of literature; *blending of quality young adult literature into the curriculum; and *attention to students who have difficulty succeeding in literature classes due to reading difficulties, disparities between school and home cultures, attitudes toward school/English, or lack of engagement with assigned texts or response activities. Thoughtfully designed to draw readers into interacting with the text, each chapter is organized around a specific question English educators frequently hear in working with pre-service and in-service teachers, and includes a Case Narrative that frames discussion of the issue that is the focus of the chapter. Many chapters include teacher narratives or lesson plans that demonstrate how a teacher implements the proposed methods. All chapters conclude with an Action Research Activity or Portfolio Reflection Activity, and an Additional Online Activities, Links, and Further Reading Suggestions box directing readers to the Teaching Literature Web site designed to be used in conjunction with this text. The interactive Web site contains recommended readings, resources, and activities; links to Web sites and PowerPoint presentations; and opportunities for readers to contribute teaching units to the Web site databases.

What is family? What is marriage? In an effort to address contemporary society's disputes over the meanings of these human social institutions, Scott Yenor carefully examines a roster of major and unexpected modern political philosophers—from Locke and Rousseau to Hegel and Marx to Freud and Beauvoir. He lucidly presents how these individuals developed an understanding of family in order to advance their goals of political and social reform. Through this exploration, Yenor unveils the effect of modern liberty on this foundational institution and argues that the quest to pursue individual autonomy has undermined the nature of marriage and jeopardizes its future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Baylor University Press,,,,Family Politics: The Idea of Marriage in Modern Political Thought,,,,Baylor University Press,,,,,Book,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/30,,[],"[{""id"": 27859, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Yenor, S.

This book explores the role of unauthorized water use in the American West (examining 11 Western States including: Arizona, California, Colorado,Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming), and argues that climate change and population growth will put more demand on water management agencies such as Idaho’s Department of Water Resources to demonstrate they are protecting the water rights of their citizens.  To assess how well-positioned each state is to adapt to climate and population changes, the author surveyed water management agencies on their unauthorized water use management strategies, finding that states vary significantly in their approaches.  After establishing the status quo, the book examines the likely policy options states and the federal government will have in addressing unauthorized water use. Weaving together a narrative drawing from a mixture of political science theory and water policy research, along with interviews of state officials and water users, and primary data, the author tells the story of how proper resource management is central to the social, political, and economic life in the American West.

This practical book illustrates how to encourage, lead, and sustain teacher-writers, especially in group contexts. In contrast to guides on writing and teacher research, this book is designed for those who support teacher-writers, such as teacher educators and literacy coaches. The authors offer descriptions of key practices they have developed over years of coaching, teaching, and collaborating with K–12 teachers who write about classroom instruction, teacher research, or advocacy for better policy and pedagogy. Knowing firsthand just how hard writing can be for teachers, they provide a repertoire of strategies to elicit writing, to support teachers as they write, to find audiences for teachers’ work, and much more.

This book offers clear guidance to coach teacher-writers to:

Choose topics and shape ideas.
Conquer insecurities and draw from their strengths.
Establish authority with their audience.
Navigate publishing, including choosing venues and working with editors.
Find time and space to write and create the habits of writing daily.

Information is easy to find, and case-based scenarios illustrate the many uses of these nonparametric strategies.  Unlike most statistics books, this was written in understandable language, so the book is accessible for nonstatisticians, yet provides information that would be useful to those already familiar with these kinds of statistical tests.  Within this book, screen shots of the software and output allow readers to follow along with each step of an analysis.  Assumptions for each of the tests, typical situations in which to use each test, and descriptions of how to explain findings in both statistical and everyday language are all included for each nonparametric strategy.  A useful companion website provides SPSS syntax for each test, along with the data set used for the scenarios in the book.  Researchers can use the data set, following the steps in the book, to practice each technique before using it with their own data.

As more people encounter archives for scholarly and avocational research, as part of creative pursuits, or to exercise their rights as citizens to access records, the possibilities for how collections are used will continue to evolve. Archivists need to be familiar with who their users are, understand why they’re using archival collections, and engage in outreach so that they can provide excellent reference services.

Reference and Access for Archives and Manuscripts outlines the various components of:

providing physical, intellectual, and virtual access,
acquiring reference knowledge and skills,
navigating legal regulations and ethics, and
designing use policies and effective outreach.
Cheryl Oestreicher contextualizes how all of these components fit within other archival functions and offers strategies and detailed practices for creating comprehensive reference programs that archivists can adapt for any type of institution.

Both new and experienced archivists will find Reference and Access for Archives and Manuscripts a solid foundation on which to add their own ideas for how to bring people into the archives as well as bring archives to the people.

This introductory text underscores the importance of news literacy to democratic life and advances an argument that critical contexts regarding news media structures and institutions should be central to news literacy education. Under the larger umbrella of media literacy, a critical approach to news literacy seeks to examine the mediated construction of the social world and the processes and influences that allow some news messages to spread while others get left out. Drawing on research from a range of disciplines, including media studies, political economy, and social psychology, this book aims to inform and empower the citizens who rely on news media so they may more fully participate in democratic and civic life.

The book is an essential read for undergraduate students of journalism and news literacy and will be of interest to scholars teaching and studying media literacy, political economy, media sociology, and political psychology.",,1,,,,,9781138625068,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Routledge,New York,,,News Literacy and Democracy,,,,,,,,,Book,,,,https://www.routledge.com/News-Literacy-and-Democracy/Ashley/p/book/9781138625068,,[],"[{""id"": 34844, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 34844, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 34844, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2017/02"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}]","['Ashley, S.']"

This question can best be answered not by imagining an uncertain high-tech future, but by examining a well-documented past—a history of instruction and media that extends from Gilgamesh to Google. Norm Friesen looks to the combination and reconfiguration of oral, textual, and more recent media forms to understand the longevity of so many educational arrangements and practices.

The author presents a unique analysis of the history of Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, a federally protected border wilderness area. Beginning in the early 1990s, changes to U.S. immigration policy dramatically altered the political and natural landscape in and around Cabeza Prieta. In particular, the increasing presence of Border Patrol has contributed to environmental degradation in wilderness. Complicated human rights concerns are also explored in the book. Protecting wildlife in an area with high rates of undocumented border-crossing and smuggling results in complex and sometimes controversial conservation policies. Ultimately, the observations and analysis presented in this book illustrate ways in which the politics of race and nationalism are subtly, but significantly, interwoven into border environmental and security policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Palgrave Macmillan ,,,,"Immigration, Environment and Security on the U.S.-Mexico Border",,,,,,,,,Book,,,,https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030318130,,"[{""attachmentid"": 17163, ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""filename"": ""1676_87015311_AUE_Meierotto_Immigration, Environment and Security on the US-Mexi (1).pdf"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeTdBWmFYSjJ5S1YxNTFHa3dDMlQ2dFN1S3UvMWFIcGJGRG9telNwYTRFNDd5ZUtjTUFwVUsvYzFnSW5xTkNvcGw5SjUvWktwQzJCYy9JdUtoN0ZFb0ljcnZiN1hKRGJiZHdtTGEwN3ZlenVYaktGOW5MRTNNZkJUbnB2bjl3cVEwbGVSa2tLMG5sck9Uc0t3K2JLcm93NUhPbzNMSzRZMHk%3D"", ""filesize"": 404843}]","[{""id"": 36055, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 36055, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 36055, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2017/02"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 36055, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2016/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}]","['Meierotto, L.']"

In synergy with other available alternatives, SMRs can be considered as a future flexible energy source for generating electricity and industrial process
heat, particularly for countries and/or sites for which large nuclear power plants would not be viable.

This publication provides IAEA Member States with a methodology to evaluate indicators for deploying SMRs in a national energy portfolio by analysing the key factors. It elaborates the specific attributes of SMRs and evaluates their deployment potential from the viewpoints of energy demand, finance and economics, infrastructure, climate change and energy security in an energy portfolio. The publication also uses case studies to illustrate the types of conditions that are potentially favourable to using an SMR.

This publication aims at giving Member States an enhanced capacity to apply a simplified process for country level self-assessment, with the flexibility to adapt to country specific needs.

42443,112081355,112081355,,2024.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Manufacturing Catastrophe (Oxford University Press, 2024) explores the origins of industrial growth and decay in the United States through a study of the paradigmatic case of southeastern Massachusetts.  American economic history has long been defined by the classic, waveform narrative of nineteenth-century industrialization, urbanization, and capitalist expansion followed by twentieth-century deindustrialization, globalization, and urban decay.  Manufacturing Catastrophe, however, argues that this foundational mythology is deeply flawed. It shows that industrial Massachusetts did not simply “rise” and “fall,” but was made and re-made over and over again, beset by incessant waves of economic collapse and reconstruction.  Tracing the successive rise and fall of the Massachusetts whaling, textile, garment, electronics, and high-tech industries over the past 200 years, it shows how Massachusetts business, labor, and political leaders repeatedly mobilized the lure of crisis itself—in everything from cheap labor and slashed tax rates to low rents and high manufacturing subsidies—to pull and push both capital and workers across the continents.  Economic catastrophe was skillfully mobilized by business leaders and policymakers to shift the geography of global capitalism to repeatedly rebuild the state's shattered economy. Crisis was, unexpectedly, a critical ingredient in the making of American industrial hegemony.      To that end, Manufacturing Catastrophe suggests that the mad scramble for globally mobile capital—the so-called ""race to the bottom""—is not some unique new problem that affluent nations alone face. As the Massachusetts case shows, it was part and parcel of the global spread of industrial capitalism itself, stretching back to the nineteenth century.  Policymakers often use these tactics of capitalist seduction to ensnare runaway industries and and lure global capital. From the perspective of Massachusetts, these are time-tested tools to foster short-term growth and cannibalize long-term prosperity.",,,,,,,9780197665329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,New York,,,"Manufacturing Catastrophe: Massachusetts and the Making of Global Capitalism, 1813 to the Present",,,,,,,,,Book,,,,https://global.oup.com/academic/product/manufacturing-catastrophe-9780197665329?lang=en&cc=us,,[],"[{""id"": 42443, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 42443, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}, {""id"": 42443, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2022/02"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}, {""id"": 42443, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2021/03"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}, {""id"": 42443, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/02"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}, {""id"": 42443, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/02"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}]","['Nichols, S.

45841,112088454,112088454,,2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose Statement: As student populations are changing, many students require additional or different support to be successful in their college career. Demographics of college students are shifting and presenting campuses with new opportunities to serve differently prepared students.  Meanwhile, higher education is under pressure to reduce budgets, and serve more students, within certain areas of the university including the library, academic advising, and other student services. . Undergraduate students have new expectations for their college experience, including immediate gainful employment, which is their primary definition of success. Academic librarians and student success administrators can collaborate, and together they can create additional pathways for students who struggle to succeed. 

This book intends to provide a roadmap for library employees and student success administrators to initiate and develop discussions on college campuses to define, then address these student needs. These needs are emergent, and while all of these students need more services and support, these services must be tailored based on regional needs. Through a selection of case studies, and historical context, readers will learn how to define what student success looks like in their units and design custom services to address student barriers to that success. 

The primary audience for this book is academic library employees and student success professionals. Academic library employees include front-line staff, librarians, managers, and administrators. On-campus student success professionals include advisors and student counselors, as well as administrators. These two main audiences-- library employees and student success professionals—share a common cause of serving students at the margins of college campus demographics. These readers will acquire skills to enhance student success initiatives and strengthen collaborations with one another? A tertiary group of potential collaborators includes higher education employees from student success programs such as TrIO, academic affairs, admissions, and student retention.

Including contributions from clinicians as well as scholars working in philosophy, literature, and culture studies, the commentaries presented here represent a wide-range of disciplinary perspectives on the concept of transference. This book is not a compendium to Lacan’s seminar. Instead it attempts to capture through shorter contributions a spectrum of voices debating, deliberating, and learning with Lacan’s concept. In doing so it can be seen to engage with transference conceptually in a manner that matches the spirit of Lacan’s seminar itself.

A part of ABC-CLIO's Examining the Facts series, which uses evidence-based documentation to examine the veracity of claims and beliefs about high-profile issues in American culture and politics, this volume examines beliefs, claims, and myths about American journalism and news media. It offers a comprehensive overview of the field of American journalism, including contemporary issues and historical foundations, and places modern problems such as ""fake news"" and misinformation in the context of larger technological and economic forces.

The book illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of journalistic practices so readers can feel empowered to navigate the complex information environment in which we live and to understand the level to which various news sources can (or can't) be trusted to provide accurate and timely coverage of issues and events of import to the public and the nation.

Chapter 2:  Fake News:  What it is, why it’s important, and why it works. 
This chapter discusses the difference among misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation and why search algorithms may lead to confirmation bias.  The chapter includes analysis of the unique features of born digital texts. The accompanying lessons will focus on helping students recognize their areas of susceptibility, helping them develop an ethic of responsibility in reading and posting, and encouraging lateral reading 
Chapter 3:  When Choosing texts and designing units
Chapter 3:  When teaching close reading
This chapter will focus on transferring understanding about the close reading of linear texts to the close reading of digital texts, using rules of notice as a heuristic.  Rules of notice are the conventional understandings experienced readers employ when they engage with texts to apportion their attention.  More specifically, the lessons will introduce students to the importance of noticing direct statements of generalization, calls to attention, ruptures, and language designed to evoke a reader’s response and engage them in developing and applying rules of digital notice.
Chapter 4:  When teaching point of view (submitted)
Chapter 5:  When teaching critical theory
This chapter will focus on the power of using critical lenses as a tool for understanding both literary and digital texts.  More specifically, the chapter will focus on how the gender and social class lenses can enliven the discussion of literary texts and provide the grounds
Chapter 6:  When teaching argumentative writing
This chapter will focus on helping students assess both linear and digital arguments and on developing understandings about how to mine digital sources in their argumentative writing.  More specifically, lessons will focus on developing criteria for evidence that can be used as a safe starting point for arguments and on identifying the tacit and explicit reasoning that writers of digital texts use in connecting their evidence to their claims.
Chapter 7:  When teaching narrative writing 
This chapter will focus on helping students understand the way narratives are employed in digital texts and developing strategies for composing compelling personal narratives.  The lessons will also examine the costs and benefits of different ways of sharing personal narratives in on-line environments.
Chapter 8:  When thinking about sensible sequencing and unit design
This chapter will provide the mental model of EMPOWER (Envision, Map, Prime, Orient, Walkthrough, Extend/Explore, Reflect) which captures major implications for teaching from across the learning science ",,First,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Corwin Publisher,"Thousand Oaks, CA",,,From Faulkner to Fake News:  Building Bridges between Literary and Digital Reading,,,,,,,,,Book,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 51540, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2021/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}]","['Wilhelm, J.

Resisting land grabbing by entrepreneurs tied to drug trafficking, agribusiness, or mining, the Peace Community refuses to support paramilitaries, army soldiers, and guerrillas. Based on ethnographic action research over a twelve year period, Christopher Courtheyn illuminates the community’s understandings of peace and territorial practices against ongoing assassinations and forced displacement. Researched during Colombia’s peace process between the government and FARC guerrillas, Community of Peace illuminates grassroots peacebuilding. Through geographical performances with the dead, the land, and fellow resistance communities, San José creates a radical and relational peace of ecological dignity. Courtheyn intervenes into debates about the meaning of peace and territory, while also interrogating the role of race in Colombia’s war and the relationship between memory and peace. Amid the widespread violence of today’s global crisis, Community of Peace illustrates San José’s rupture with the logics of coloniality and capitalism through the construction of political solidarity and communal peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,University of Pittsburgh Press,Pittsburgh,,,Community of Peace: Performing Geographies of Ecological Dignity in Colombia,,,,,,,,,Book,,,,,,"[{""attachmentid"": 26041, ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""filename"": ""Courtheyn CONTRACT SIGNED.pdf"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeW1KUlhWN2tRSzloWCtnZjRLQTY2VU5RVTJJVzd3Qk10WStCNU54S25Lb3QxVFRSeHRiWkRvT2Y3TGt2S3pPbENUY0hFWWpnTFdEZz0%3D"", ""filesize"": 2374747}]","[{""id"": 51762, ""status"": ""Revise &amp; Resubmit"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/02"", ""listingorder"": 3, ""completionorder"": 3}]","['Courtheyn, C.']"

57262,113156458,113156458,,2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our everyday world is full of mysteries that many people never even stop to think about. For example, think about your senses? What is going on inside your ears, eyes, fingertips, nose, and mouth that allow these organs to interact with the physical world and report what they find to your brain? The answer to all these questions is molecular biology. Unfortunately, a vast number of people have virtually no concept of how molecules work. The main goal of this book it to provide a fundamental understanding of molecular function to those that have none. Have you ever stopped to wonder how your eyes can convert light into nerve impulses? Or maybe how your ears translate sound waves into brain waves? What about your sense of touch...? how do your fingers sense pressure? These are mysteries that many people never stop to think about, but they should. Without a background in science, the answers might seem so complex that only a specialist could understand them. The truth however is that the answer to all these questions is simply, molecular biology. The living molecules of biology control countless events in our everyday lives, and yet the majority of people have no concept of how molecular events work. While it's true that you can spend a lifetime trying to understand the deepest secrets of the molecular world, you don't need to be an expert to have a working knowledge of the basics of the molecular sciences.

If you are interested at all in understanding how your molecular world works, this book will teach you fundamentals of molecular function that will translate to all other molecular events in your daily life. Professor Allan Albig uses examples that everyone can understand like the differences between medicines and toxins, understanding how electric eels produce electricity, and how your sense of smell works, to teach fundamentals of molecular biology. Professor Albig has taught these subjects for more than 20 years in colleges in three states and will educate you about molecular biology so you can better understand your world and appreciate the everyday elegance of your molecular reality.",,,,,,,9781667803814,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,BookBaby,,,,"It's Not Magic, It's Biology: A guided tour through your molecular world!",,,,,,,,,Book,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 57262, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Albig, A.', 'Overgaard, E.', 'Albig, R.']"

But in proceeding further―and unlike Rousseau or Locke before him―Schleiermacher carefully avoids assuming that education is primarily about a return to nature or about ""soundness"" of mind and body. Education is instead an ethical and political undertaking and a pragmatic art whose ultimate object and morality has differed greatly over time. It is exercised as a form of practical influence of the older generation on the younger: ""A significant part of the activity of the older generation extends toward the younger,"" Schleiermacher reasons, and it ""is more complete and perfect the more it is governed by an idea of what   should   happen―the more it has an exemplar to guide its action―the more it is an   art  .  ""   This book offers these and other insights on education―long canonical in Central and Northern Europe―for the first time to an English audience. It also provides five chapters by scholars in education and its history that discuss various aspects of Schleiermacher’s lecture.",,1st,,,,,978-1433193873,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Peter Lang,New York,,,F.D.E.

70461,114204687,114204687,,2024.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background  : At the recommendation of the deparment chair, in 2023 I authored a textbook to be used to teach OPWL 535,  Principles of Adult Learning . As a part of my research lab, I had dedicated the previous 1.5 years to reviewing the literature that would contribute to this book: cognitive psychology, neuroscience, memory, information processing, behaviorism, social learning, etc. I completed v1.0 of the book to be used in teaching OPWL 535 for Fall 2023. 
   Book Description  : This graduate-level book covers principles of adult learning from the fields of neuroscience and cognitive psychology. The book opens with several contextual chapters covering the relationship between learning and performance in organizations, the science of developing expertise, and considerations of neurodiversity, culture, and ethics. The bulk of the book is then organized according to the three fundamental dimensions of learning: cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional. There are four chapters dedicated to the cognitive dimension, covering the central nervous system, memory, neuroplasticity, metacognition, and learning through audio-visual channels via technology. There is one chapter dedicated to the behavioral dimension, focusing on highly behavioral performances. There are two chapters dedicated to the socio-emotional dimension, covering attitude, mindset, the role of emotion in the learning process, social constructivism, and social learning theory. The book ends with tactical chapters that discuss the key considerations for instructional designers (IDs) and learning experience designers (LXDs), and near-future trends. (Currently 211 pages.)

Many first-year writing and GTA mentoring programs have needed to respond to challenges to these commonplaces. Such challenges may arise from a network of situations and stakeholders, including the program administrator's own observations, pressure from budgetary constraints, questions by administration, or needs of the graduate students themselves. We find ourselves in a kairotic moment that requires us to reflect on why we do what we do in the ways we do it. From this reflection, change is inevitable and possibly may be taking very different forms. Have you pushed back on some of these commonplaces? Have you found validation for/through them?

The book delves into various facets of the international student experience, including their enrollment trends, economic contributions, and academic and research impact, with a significant focus on the hardships they face, particularly in the realm of sexual health. The authors explore the historical context of international students in the U.S., noting the evolution of their presence from the late 1800s to the present day. They highlight the resilience of these students in overcoming language barriers, cultural adjustments, financial stress, and visa regulations. The book emphasizes the economic benefits that international students bring to the U.S., contributing to tuition revenue, local economies, and job creation. A major theme of the book is the underrepresentation of international students in health research and the unique perspectives they offer. The authors argue for the inclusion of international students in research studies to enhance the quality and relevance of health research. In addressing sexual health, the book examines the diverse cultural backgrounds of international students and the impact of these backgrounds on their sexual health behaviors and attitudes. It provides detailed analyses of sexual health cultures in various countries, highlighting the cultural norms and societal expectations that shape sexual health education and behaviors. Through personal narratives, academic research, and practical recommendations, the authors advocate for culturally sensitive sexual health education and resources to support international students, aiming to foster a more inclusive and understanding environment in U.S. educational institutions.",,,,,,,979-8-89530-156-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Nova Science Publishers,,,,Cultural Crossroads of Sexual Health: Insights from International Students,,,,,,,,,Book,,,,https://doi.org/10.52305/JYIS0736,,"[{""attachmentid"": 58655, ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""filename"": ""Cultural Crossroads of Sexual Health.pdf"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeWhWcTBXY1RCaTQ5ei9SdXMzeUowL09nM1RwR0NuMjhXcER6SnFHczVMckJmbXMwM0oxTzNzd0oxSzAyRkR6OWhhelpOZFlQU0VoMThiQWtDN2ZnNHozeXhUZmw0M2x0cQ%3D%3D"", ""filesize"": 3500448}]","[{""id"": 74415, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Chaliawala, K.

75696,114227776,114227776,,2026.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a book-level research project examining the dual roles of both Latinx (immigrant) and the majority White populations in processes of integration and belonging in Caldwell, Idaho. Caldwell is unique in its demographic profile relative to the rest of Idaho. US Census data shows Caldwell’s population includes 37.5 percent self-identified Hispanic/Latinos and a foreign-born population of 11.2 percent. Both populations are well above the size of these populations in the state (13.5% and 5.8%, respectively). This provides an interesting site to examine processes of societal integration and belonging as negotiated in real-time among historically (and continued) marginalized populations (Latinx and immigrant) and those in the historically advantaged majority group, White Americans.    
  I draw on recent work that places a premium on context and racial composition of social settings to understand processes of integration and belonging. Jiménez (2014) referenced this in his idea of   relational assimilation  , the “back-and-forth adjustments in daily life by both newcomers and established individuals as they come into contact with one another” (11). Jones (2019) wrote to changes in racial relationships among populations of color (Latinx and Black) in North Carolina brought on by the recent influx of Latinx (immigrants) into a non-traditional immigrant destination. While my work will share this latter aspect with Jones’ work, as Idaho is among the states with the smallest immigrant population, it differs in that the salient intergroup dynamic is Latinx-White. Recent work by Jiménez et al. (2021) spoke to aspects of belonging in Arizona and New Mexico, as perceived by Latinx and White Americans. However, Caldwell differs from these two settings in that both the Latinx and immigrant populations differ very much from the rest of the state. This places emphasis on the unique context of Caldwell to study process of integration and belonging from the perspectives of both the (racial) minority and majority groups as they negotiate macro level narratives and events about immigration and race in their local setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,,,,,"Changing Landscapes and Changing Minds(?):

There were also questions about what family values were, and if they included things like a strong economy, and a good job market, or were simply social issues like marriage and family.

This groundbreaking work offers a vital, dual perspective, interweaving deeply personal lived experiences with rigorous academic research to illuminate the multifaceted journey of cultural and academic adaptation. Beyond the author’s compelling narrative in the preface, the book shares personal stories, making complex challenges tangible and relatable. From dissecting the nuances of U.S. grading systems and academic culture to exploring complex social integration, language proficiency hurdles, and the pervasive challenges of “othering” and discrimination, this book provides an honest and comprehensive account. A unique focus is placed on the distinct barriers faced by female students from conservative cultural backgrounds, offering empathetic insight into their unique struggles with participation, social norms, and mental well-being. Distinguished by its blend of personal narrative and evidence-based solutions, this book transcends mere description. It critically examines the role of institutional support, advocating for culturally sensitive mentorship, inclusive classroom practices, tailored mental health services, and essential cultural competency training for faculty and staff. ‘Cultural Influences and International Students’ is an indispensable resource for current and prospective international students seeking to understand and prepare for their journey. It is also an essential guide for higher education professionals, including faculty, advisors, administrators, and policymakers, providing actionable strategies to foster truly inclusive environments.
