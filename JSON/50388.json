        "Description/Abstract": "Looking back 100 years to another time of uncertainty, this presentation creates a unit plan that focuses on German and Austrian artists' use of self portraits in the 1920s, but can be expanded geographically and culturally.  Students will implement all four language skills in the unit, focusing specifically on presentational writing and reflection that correspond with the creation of their own self-portrait and an artist\u2019s statement during this current time of uncertainty.  \n\n2 Outcomes\nParticipants will explore how to design units that use written and visual authentic texts to interpret and infer meaning from self-portraits. \n\nParticipants will explore how to design units to identify &quot;community&quot; and compare historic and contemporary use of self-portraits.  \n",
