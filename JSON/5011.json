        "Description/Abstract": "Objective: Risk-taking behavior (e.g., alcohol abuse, tobacco usage, misuse of prescription medications) among college students is a widespread problem. Our study focused not only on the frequency of risky health behaviors in college students, but also the companions with whom they engaged in such behaviors. \nMethods: Three hundred and twelve college students completed a survey examining the frequency with which they engaged in alcohol, tobacco, and improper prescription medication use, as well as with whom they were most likely to engage in these behaviors.\nResults: Results indicated that participants were most likely to take health risks when accompanied by someone they consider a friend. Results also indicated gender differences in risk taking behaviors, as well as an interaction effect between companion and gender.\nConclusions: This information would be useful when developing preventive interventions for college students. Implementing interventions which are specific to certain populations might generate greater success in reducing risk-taking behavior.",
