        "Description/Abstract": "Background: Approximately 91% of children ages 2 to 17 in the United States play screen-based games. Adolescents spend 4 to 7 hours a day on screen-based entertainment including playing video games. One genre of video games, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG), have become a cultural phenomenon drawing in players, many of them adolescents, at an alarming rate. This is concerning because some people experience negative effects from gaming.\nPurpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to provide an overview of the current evidence on the predisposing factors and effects of problematic gaming in children and adolescents.\nMethods: Three databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Academic Search Premier) were searched using keywords individually and in combination. PRISMA methodology was used to guide this review. Sixteen eligible studies were included for review.\nResults: The quality of evidence was medium to high (Mean = 0.92, Range = 0.7-1.0). Time spent gaming and age of the child were not found to be predictors of problematic gaming. The following variables predicted problematic gaming: being male, playing online versus offline, playing alone or with virtual teammates, and getting less sleep due to game-playing or nighttime waking to game. Protective factors included positive family cohesiveness, high academic achievement, and satisfactory social relationships with family, friends, and teachers.\nConclusions: Predicting the development of problematic gaming remains challenging due to a lack of standardized criteria to study or diagnose problematic gaming. Health care providers, however, should educate parents on how to look for problematic gaming behaviors.\nKeywords: video games, problematic gaming behaviors, internet gaming disorder\n",
