        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from wastewater using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (via Novogene).\u00a0 Bioinformatic analysis included filtering reads containing adapters and those with low data quality. Further assembly, gene prediction, and species annotation were performed. Results showcased species abundance in a sample of Boise\u2019s sewage ecosystem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the utility and efficiency of wastewater surveillance. We have been measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Boise\u2019s wastewater for 2 years. In order to investigate unexplained fluctuations in viral counts, we initiated metagenomic analysis. We identified the abundant species and viruses represented in this sample, laying the groundwork to correlate changes in metagenomics with specific pathogen detection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
