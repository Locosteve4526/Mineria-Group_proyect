        "Description/Abstract": "Entrepreneurial ecosystems have emerged as a focal point in the strategic agendas of\u00a0national and regional governmental bodies, driven by the goal of stimulating economic growth.\u00a0The overarching objective of these ecosystems is to act as a facilitative milieu for high-growth\u00a0ventures. Within the United States, there exists a pronounced emphasis on advancing\u00a0entrepreneurial initiatives in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\u00a0(STEM), as these ventures are more likely to result in companies that grow beyond their\u00a0entrepreneur (Schumpeter, 1934). Universities, in concert with governmental support structures,\u00a0occupy a pivotal role in the orchestration and evolution of EEs. Noteworthy in this regard is the\u00a0proactive involvement of the National Science Foundation (NSF), which has championed a\u00a0program specifically designed to support nascent entrepreneurs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This session will be of interest to any faculty member involved with innovation, entrepreneurs, or entrepreneurship. As academics, we don\u2019t always have the time to reflect on\u00a0our role and place within the larger environment. This session will give participants the\u00a0opportunity to share with and learn from their peers. This session will introduce and discuss the\u00a0entrepreneur ecosystem framework and then use examples to illustrate its application, which will\u00a0also include the I-Corps training program and its training outcomes. I-Corps is an NSF-funded\u00a0program aimed at supporting University-led innovation commercialization. Results from I-Corps-supported research will be discussed, and two (or more) members of the national I-Corps\u00a0program will discuss their experiences.",
