        "Description/Abstract": "This study uses interviews with 64 Canadian and 65 United States  scientists to compare and contrast their perspectives with respect to  environmental policy making across borders, both geographic (Canada  versus United States) and disciplinary (natural versus social science).  The findings indicate that important imbalances remain between Canadian  and United States scientists' perceptions about cross-border pollution.  There appears to be a great divergence between the responses of natural  and social scientists in the United States and a robust similarity  between the responses of natural and social scientists in Canada. In the  end, the results support the view that issues centered on the  Canada-United States environmental borderlands remain firmly linked to  national differences and issues centered on the science-policy linkage  remain substantially linked to disciplinary differences.",
