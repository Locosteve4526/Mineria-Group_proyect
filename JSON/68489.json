        "Description/Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare, neurodegenerative motor neuron disease that affects voluntary muscle movement. Often, difficulty in coughing, breathing, and swallowing are sequela associated with the condition, and the presence of bulbar muscle predominant weakness results in deleterious effects on airway clearance and secretion management. This narrative review will provide practical guidance for clinicians treating this population. Cough insufficiency in this population typically manifests as a prolonged, slow, weak cough effort that impedes the clearability of secretions and airway protection. Dystussia and dysphagia frequently occur simultaneously in bulbar dysfunction, subsequently impacting respiratory health. Measures of respiratory strength should be obtained and monitored every 3\u20136 months, preferably in a multidisciplinary clinic setting. Cough augmentation, whether manual or mechanical techniques, should be sought as early in the disease progression as possible to adequately control secretions in the proximal airways. This airway clearance strategy can aid in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections (RTIs), which can pose a significant clinical hurdle to those with ALS. The use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation may be complicated by severe bulbar dysfunction rendering this technique ineffective. Though peripheral airway clearance strategies, such as high-frequency chest-wall compression, have the advantage of being less impacted by bulbar dysfunction, it is only recommended this modality be used in conjunction with, versus in lieu of, proximal strategies. Salivary secretion management includes the use of anticholinergics, botulinum toxin, and radiation therapy depending on severity and desire for relief.",
