        "Description/Abstract": "In the  mid-1970s a Clovis point was collected from the surface of an  archaeological site along a small creek east of Big Springs Creek in  southcentral Owyhee County by Mr. Wayne Welch (see Figure 1). The Big Springs Creek area is within the southcentral  portion of the Owyhee Uplands which is characterized by a  sagebrush-juniper steppe and crosscut by numerous small streams at  elevations between 5500 and 5700 feet. The  point is reported to have been collected near an archaeological site  characterized by rather extensive tools and debris. If the artifact was collected from a site with extensive  cultural remains the find is especially notable as most other Clovis  discoveries in southwest Idaho have been isolated surface finds. Archaeological sites have been described in the Big  Springs area (see Plew 1980)  but dale primarily within the Late Archaic period. While Clovis points have been found in southwestern Idaho  they are rare finds and have not been previously reported from the  central Owyhee Uplands.",
