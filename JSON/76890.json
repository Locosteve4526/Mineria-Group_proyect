        "Description/Abstract": "This paper considers why it is that academic election forecasts have not been broadly applied to democracies around the world, with the vast majority of forecasts taking place in North America and Western Europe. Data considerations, lack of democratic stability, and a fairly narrow band of election forecasters all play a role in the small number of forecasts. I consider what might expand the &quot;N&quot; of academic election forecasting, focusing on data and theoretical concerns.",
