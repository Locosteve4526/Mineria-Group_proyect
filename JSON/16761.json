        "Description/Abstract": "The thermodynamic properties of a model infrared heat reflective helmet were evaluated using an advanced thermal manikin technology. The aluminized model helmet was tested for infrared (IR) radiation attenuation properties. Total manikin heat gain and changes in surface temperature were documented for controlled IR radiation exposure levels. The results illustrate the benefits offered by an aluminized reflective surface in attenuating IR radiation and the advantages of using a spacer harness system to minimize radiant heat transfer from the helmet to the head",
