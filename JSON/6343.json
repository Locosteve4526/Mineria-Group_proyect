        "Description/Abstract": "As part of an NSF-funded Course Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement  (CCLI) project that seeks, in part, to increase student exposure to  scientific instrumentation, a gas chromatography experiment has been  integrated into the second-semester general chemistry laboratory  curriculum. The experiment uses affordable, commercially available  equipment and materials. It also parallels the corresponding lecture  topics, reinforcing the concept of intermolecular forces (and exposing  the structural basis of these forces) through the drawing of Lewis  structures, microscale distillation, and gas chromatography. Group  presentations end the laboratory session, exposing all students to the  entirety of analytical data obtained by their peers. Students respond  favorably to the exercise, citing use of the gas chromatograph as  interesting and the group presentations as highly beneficial to their  understanding of the material.",
