        "Description/Abstract": "&quot;Sacred Seeds&quot; is an interdisciplinary study of England\u2019s material and textual appropriation of the New World environment and culture in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It considers how the Amerindian culture and environment stretched across national and international boundaries, and more importantly, how, and by whom, this culture was consumed in early modern England. While primarily a literary study, focusing on the works of writers such as Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and Thomas More, this project also intersects with ethnographic studies of Latin American culture, the history of science, and transatlantic and environmental studies. This book is as much about Amerindian culture as it is about England. The encounter with the Americas, writes Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, the secretary to conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, was \u201cthe greatest event since the creation of the world.\u201d More than four-hundred years later, present-day writers still use the justifiably hyperbolic echoes of G\u00f3mara to describe the significance of this world-changing event. For instance, in The Conquest of America, Tzvetan Todorov acknowledges that \u201cthe discovery of America, or of the Americans, is certainly the most astonishing encounter of our history.\u201d Although England did not make the initial discovery or partake in American colonization for several decades after Columbus, its literary myths and commercial markets were quickly transformed by this remarkable encounter with the New World\nRole:  Principal",
