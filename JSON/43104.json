        "Description/Abstract": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a model of inflammatory demyelinating diseases associated with neutrophil infiltration and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We recently reported that IL-1\u03b2-mediated loss of claudin-5 (CLDN5) from brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) is dependent on non-muscle MLCK (nmMLCK), a known inflammatory rheostat that mediates endothelial hyperpermeability and neutrophil (PMN) transendothelial migration (TEM). In this study we tested whether loss of nmMLCK expression rescues EAE-induced BBB dysfunction and CNS injury. Indeed, severity of EAE-induced demyelination and paralysis in nmmlck-/- mice was reduced. Accordingly, mice exhibit attenuated PMN extravasation, BBB dysfunction and CLDN5 loss during the preclinical stage of EAE. Using BMVECs from nmmlck+/+ or nmmlck-/- mice, we found that stimulation with cell-free media from activated PMNs led to a biphasic loss in barrier integrity, as opposed to nmmlck-/- monolayers which exhibited a blunted barrier dysfunction and were resistant to PMN-TEM. The first \u2018rapid-phase\u2019 was associated with junctional remodeling and increased PMN-TEM, whereas the second \u2018sustained-phase\u2019 was associated with CLDN5 downregulation and exhibited significantly faster rates of PMN-TEM. Loss-of-function/gain-of-function studies also revealed CLDN5 expression as a major determinant for the extent of PMN-TEM and barrier integrity. Finally, in vitro and in vivo Cldn5 knockdown abrogated the protective effects of nmMLCK deficiency. These results suggest PMNs can trigger CLDN5 downregulation through nmMLCK-dependent signaling in BBB-ECs, a necessary step for increased trafficking of PMNs into the parenchyma and EAE-induced CNS injury. \n",
