        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Identity formation has long been theorized as an outcome of back-and-forth processes individuals have with other social actors and the social environments in which they live. This study seeks to understand identity formation in relation to racial patterns and the role of social experiences in shaping how native-born Americans \u201cfeel American.\u201d Does race pattern differences among individuals in their self-identification as American? What do these patterns look like when observing the degree to which native-born Americans perceive they are recognized as American by others? How might social experiences involving challenges to one\u2019s American identity illuminate these racial patterns? This study employs a mixed methods design using primary data from the Race- Ascription, Assertion, and Contextual Experiences Study (RAACES), for both the survey sample (n= 1,894) and nested sample of interviewees (n = 94). Race patterns both self-identity and reflected dimensions of American identity, with White respondents consistently \u201cfeeling\u201d and \u201cfeel being seen as\u201d more American relative to Asian and Latinx Americans. The follow-up interviews reveal that those who have experienced &lt;em&gt;challenged Americanness, &lt;/em&gt;are overwhelmingly persons of color. Moreover, those who have had their American identity questioned by others tend to perceive these as racialized events. Thus, by delving into individuals\u2019 experiences of &lt;em&gt;challenged Americanness&lt;/em&gt; we gain insight to the internalization of messaging from social interactions that shapes how American one \u201cfeels\u201d and how Americans perceive recognition as American by others.&lt;/p&gt;",
