        "Description/Abstract": "This study explored how Mexican immigrant and first-generation Mexican youth resist, conform to, and persist in schooling. Using Latino Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) as a framework, evidence of the \u201csticky mess\u201d of racial inequalities (Espinoza &amp; Harris, 1997 Espinoza, L. and Harris, A. P. 1997. Afterword: Embracing the tar-baby: LatCrit theory and the sticky mess of race. California Law Review, 10(1): 499\u2013559. ) was shown to impact the lives of all participants. However, the strength of community cultural wealth (Yosso, 2005 Yosso, T. J. 2005. Whose culture has capital? A critical race theory discussion of community cultural wealth. Race, Ethnicity and Education, 8(1): 69\u201391. [Taylor &amp; Francis Online], 2006 Yosso, T. J. 2006. Critical race counterstories along the Chicana/Chicano educational pipeline, New York, NY: Routledge Press. ) mitigated the youths' negative school experiences. Analysis of the dialogic semistructured focal group interviews that comprise the data set focused on the students' family, life in Mexico, and schooling experiences both in Mexico and the U.S.",
