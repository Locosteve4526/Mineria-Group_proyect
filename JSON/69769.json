        "Description/Abstract": "This presentation considers what happens when your city becomes the \u201cit\u201d city to which all of America seems to be migrating. Focusing on Boise, Idaho, and its growth in the early 2020s, I discuss how longtime residents perceive increasing (positive) public notoriety and accompanying growth, particularly when this means that housing prices also increase. Following a discussion of the roots of Boise's boom and impacts on housing prices, I relate findings regarding how residents understand changes in neighborhood life, such as concerns regarding direct and symbolic displacement, shifts in the quality of neighborhood life, and the need to utilize connections to place, or sophisticated concepts from urban studies and planning, to resist neighborhood-level changes.",
