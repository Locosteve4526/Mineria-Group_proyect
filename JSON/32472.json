        "Description/Abstract": "Energy efficiency has become a growing concern due to the negative effects associated with burning fossil fuels and wasting natural resources. Buildings contribute to a large portion of the world\u2019s energy use, and the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems are usually one of the largest consumers of energy in buildings. Building design, including HVAC systems, is essential to manipulating heat exchange and promoting energy efficiency. This project reviews some of the currently available methods of building heating and cooling, focusing on the overall systems and implementation. Energy efficiency simulation tools available today can help identify HVAC systems most suitable for any given building type and geographic location. OpenStudio, SketchUp, and EnergyPlus are used in this project to simulate certain HVAC systems in standardized apartments in Boise, Idaho, in order to determine the relative efficiency of each system in a local setting.
