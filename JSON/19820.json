        "Description/Abstract": "Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter can help employees enhance a company\u2019s marketing, recruiting, security, and safety.  However, employees\u2019 use of social networking sites and employers\u2019 access of those sites can result in illegal and unethical behavior, such as discrimination and privacy invasions.  Companies must gauge whether and how to rely upon employees\u2019 use of personal social networking sites and how much freedom employees should have in using networks inside and outside of the companies.  This research summarizes the latest legal and ethical issues associated with employee use of social networks and provides recommended corporate policies.  ",
