        "Description/Abstract": "Alcohol is the most widely used drug among athletes and its misuse with  this population is well documented (O'Brien &amp; Lyons, 2000). However,  underlying emotional causes for its misuse have not been identified,  nor has the interaction of gender and athletic status been examined. We  hypothesized that coping styles used by athletes would relate to their  drinking behaviors and this pattern would differ based on gender and  athletic status. Female non-athletes consumed the least amount of  alcohol and male non-athletes were the least likely to become  intoxicated, whereas male athletes drank the greatest amount and were  the most likely to become intoxicated. Drinking to cope had the highest  correlation to drinking behaviors, but there were differences in the  relation between coping tactics and drinking behaviors dependent upon  gender and athletic status.",
