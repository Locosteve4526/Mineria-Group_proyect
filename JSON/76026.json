        "Description/Abstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants have continued to evolve to accommodate new understandings of knee mechanics. The medial-pivot implant is a newer design, which is intended to limit anterior-posterior translation in the medial compartment while allowing lateral compartment translation. However, evidence for a generalized medial-pivot characteristic across all activities is limited. The purpose of the study was to quantify and compare in\u00a0vivo knee joint kinematics using high-speed stereo radiography during activities of daily living in patients who have undergone a TKA with a cruciate sacrificing medial-pivot implant to age-matched and sex-matched native controls.",
