        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Applicative constructions in Northern Uto-Aztecan (NUA) languages, although dissimilar in form, share many functional-semantic features and similar historical developments. All NUA languages carry a verb suffix signaling the addition of a bene- factive argument to the organic valence. In most cases, they represent the only means for expressing a beneficiary as a core argument. Applicative suffixes in NUA appear in most cases to originate from a \u2018give\u2019 verb. Although not always noted as such in the available grammatical descriptions, NUA applicative constructions show causative-ben- efactive syncretism associated with semantic verb type. The benefactive function is quite consistent with transitive and active (agentive) intransitives, whereas with stative (or patientive) intransitive verbs, the suffix functions as a causative. In languages that have distinct applicative forms and morphological causatives, their frequency of use still follows this pattern. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
