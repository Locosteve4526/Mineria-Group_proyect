        "Description/Abstract": "In the western United States, the mountain snowpack is an important  natural reservoir that extends spring and summer water delivery to  downstream users and ecosystems. The importance of winter snow  accumulation to upland ecosystems is not as clearly defined. This study  investigates the relative contribution of winter precipitation to upland  spring and summer soil moisture storage and availability in a semi-arid  mountainous watershed. At this site, coarse soil textures and shallow  soil depths limit soil storage capacity to 6\u201316?cm. Winter precipitation  exceeds soil storage capacity by 2.5 times. Accordingly, soil moisture  profiles at most locations in the watershed reach field capacity in  early winter. With soil storage near capacity, water released by  snowmelt primarily contributes to deep drainage and makes a limited  contribution to the soil moisture reservoir. Water that is retained by  the soil after the snowpack melts is lost to evapotranspiration in as  little as 10?days. In contrast, spring precipitation extends moist soil  conditions by up to 90?days into the warm season, when ecological water  demand is highest. These field observations suggest that changes in  spring precipitation, not winter snowpack, may have the greater impact  on upland ecosystems in this environment. Furthermore, because winter  precipitation is in excess compared to the soil storage capacity, soil  moisture availability may be fairly insensitive to climate  change-induced transitions from snow to rain.",
