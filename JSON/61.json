        "Description/Abstract": "Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) programs are designed to integrate management of risks from a wide variety of sources. ERM improves risk management by promoting awareness of all sources of risk, and by aligning strategic and operational decision making across the entity with the company's risk appetite (e.g., COSO 2004; Nocco and Stulz 2006). As such, ERM is a corporate governance mechanism that constrains and coordinates managers' behavior. While potential benefits to firm performance and value (e.g., through improving efficiency and reducing volatility) have been espoused (Beasley, Pagach, and Warr 2008; Hoyt and Liebenberg 2011), there is little available archival evidence on these benefits. Our investigation concentrates on two principle questions. First, what factors are associated with high-quality ERM programs as measured by ratings produced by Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P)? Second, are the anticipated benefits of high-quality ERM for performance realized, and do the markets recognize those benefits by rewarding program quality and valuing the reduction in uncertainty that better risk management brings?",
