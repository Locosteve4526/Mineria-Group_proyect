        "Description/Abstract": "In technical communication, discussions on how to best prepare\ngraduates to meet workplace challenges range from responding\nto changing technology and occupational needs to focusing on\ncreating flexible workers. Part of this conversation centers on\nexpertise: what kinds of expertise are most valued and how can\ngraduates be trained to be experts? In this article, we explore our\nfi eld\u2019s understandings of expertise by focusing on a recent master\u2019s\ngraduate and practitioner, Megan. As first an intern then a fulltime\nemployee at HP Inc, Megan experienced clashes between\nthe classroom and workplace, which she sought to reconcile. In\naddition, she also had to learn to assert herself as a subject matter\nexpert (SME) while working alongside SMEs. This navigation was\nnot something her education necessarily prepared her for, and when\ncompared to surveyed graduates\u2019 experiences, may be something\nprograms could emphasize. We conclude with recommendations\nfor how academic programs can incorporate conversations about\nexpertise and equip students to assert themselves as communication\nSMEs and build on that expertise after graduation.",
