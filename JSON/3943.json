        "Description/Abstract": "Titanite grains from ~ 800 \u00b0C gneisses of the c. 6-km thick Greater Himalayan Sequence of central Nepal were analyzed for Zr-in-titanite temperatures and U\u2013Pb ages to investigate the formation and evolution of a former weak mid-crustal channel in the Himalaya. Laser-ablation ICP-MS depth profiles and spot analyses of titanite Zr and U\u2013Pb isotopic compositions are inconsistent with diffusional reequilibration on scales greater than 1\u20132 ?m, and instead data appear to faithfully record both temperature and age. Titanite records protracted heating from 700\u2013750 \u00b0C at ~ 37 Ma to 775 \u00b0C at ~ 24 Ma, and possibly slight cooling to 765 \u00b0C at ~ 20 Ma. Such temperatures exceed partial melting reactions in associated metapelites and imply profoundly weak rheologies (i.e. a hot channel), yet predate initiation of the bounding Main Central Thrust and South Tibetan Detachment systems by as much as 15 Myr. Evidently, thick but weak crustal channels may remain stationary with respect to the convergence direction for &gt;10 Myr, even during one of Earth's biggest continent\u2013continent collisions.",
