        "Description/Abstract": "\u201cAn Impotent Veracity for Desultory Information\u201d:Reading Moore\u2019s Miscellaneous Notebook, 1930-1943\nJeff Westover\nSeveral passages in a reading notebook Marianne Moore maintained from 1930 to 1943 (VII.2.2) attest to Moore\u2019s focus on the limitations on human knowledge, limitations based on the complexity and scale of the cosmos, theological ideas about human nature, and perhaps even the contingent nature of taxonomies. For example, in an article about Roger and Francis Bacon in Scientific Monthly by Sanford Fernando, a physicist who taught at Stanford, Moore singles out the following passage about the medieval scholar Roger Bacon\u2019s view of \u201cthe fallibility of human reason\u201d:\nit is certain that never, before God is seen face to face, shall a man know anything with final certainty. It is impossible therefore for a man to attain perfect knowledge in this life, &amp; it is exceedingly difficult for him to attain perfect truth, &amp; he is very prone &amp; disposed toward whatever is false &amp; empty; wherefore man ought not to boast of his knowledge. (image 00220 verso and recto)\nThis excerpt squares with a traditional Christian emphasis on humility as a virtue. But it appears in a popular article by a professional scientist who singles out Bacon for his emphasis on the importance of evidence-based reasoning. At the same time that Moore demonstrates her appetite for learning about a variety of topics, she testifies to her belief about the limits to human knowledge in such passages. This conflicting attitude toward knowing things seems in keeping with Moore\u2019s poetic values of intensive detail, energetic syntax, and restraint. In the poems of the thirties (the ones most relevant to the notebook), as in the earlier poems \u201cThe Octopus\u201d and \u201cMarriage,\u201d she sometimes offers a bewildering array of images and ideas. This can arouse a kind of exhilaration in the reader, but it also points to the challenges of sorting out significance. It may also caution readers to acknowledge the complexity, diversity, and contradictory aspects of experience in order to avoid oversimplifying them. The notebook\u2019s diversity of subjects, together with such caution about the limits of knowledge, provides a model for considering the central tension in her poems between a voracious \u201ccapacity for fact\u201d (as Moore puts it in \u201cThe Octopus\u201d) and a reverent restraint in the face of imperfect human wisdom. \n",
