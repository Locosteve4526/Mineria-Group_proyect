        "Description/Abstract": "The election forecasting industry has been aggressively criticized for getting the final result wrong in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In this systematic assessment of the forecasts, I find these criticisms to be less than meets the eye, in three respects. First, the majority of the forecasts focused on the two-party popular vote outcome, not the electoral vote outcome. In this respect, the majority of the forecasts were correct in predicting the winner of the popular vote, Hillary Clinton. Second, the single-point forecasts made by academic teams performed as well if not better than the highly publicized polling aggregator forecasters, such as FiveThirtyEight and The New York Times Upshot. Third, a comparison of the model performance over the decades reveals the marked improvement in their performance. In short, the forecasts were very accurate and well within the margin of error of a very close election.",
