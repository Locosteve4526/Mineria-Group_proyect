        "Description/Abstract": "For D=43, the least x for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 59. The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 59, but the smallest x in this case is 23, which is less than 59. The next prime, D, after 59 for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 67 and the least x for which it has a solution is 221, which is larger than 59, so it is a new record value. 67 is a term for this sequence and 221 qualifies for membership to A336791, but 59 does not qualify because the least x for which x^2-47*y^2=-2 has a solution is not a record value.",
