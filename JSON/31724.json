        "Description/Abstract": "Most close-in gas giant exoplanets are unstable against tidal decay, and as these gas giants spiral inward and shed their atmospheres, their rocky and icy cores are stranded in orbits with periods as short as a few hours. Such fossil cores have been outside the main Kepler mission search parameters, but recently a few planets and a number more candidates with periods less than 1 day have been identified by different groups. We present the latest results from Superpig (the Short Period Planet Group) on identifying and characterizing such planets in the Kepler archive, combined with ground-based follow-up observations (RV and AO).
