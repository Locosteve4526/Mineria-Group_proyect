        "Description/Abstract": "Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used as a cleanup method for the analysis of organophosphorus pesticides in household and vehicle dusts. The pesticides investigated were diazinon, methyl parathion, chlorpyrifos, malathion, phosmet, and azinphosmethyl. These compounds are of interest due to their use in agricultural tree fruit production and/or urban pest control. Pesticides were determined via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring and cool on-column injection. The lower limit of method validation was 0.20 microg/g. Method limits of detection in dust ranged from 0.012-0.055 microg/g. Dust samples were collected with vacuums from the homes and vehicles of people living and working in a rural agricultural region in the central part of Washington State. The analytes were extracted from the dust by sonication in acetone. The extracts were solvent-exchanged to cyclohexane, frozen, thawed, and centrifuged prior to SEC injection. Following SEC, the eluent was split into 2 fractions, concentrated, and injected on-column into the gas chromatograph. This method represents the first complete publication describing the SEC cleanup of organophosphorus pesticides in dusts. Recoveries of pesticides in dusts ranged from 63.5-110.8 +/- 4.9-19.6% over a fortification range of 0.20-10.00 microg/g. This optimized, automated, and reproducible SEC method does not require further treatment or cleanup for trace determination of these organophosphorus pesticides.",
