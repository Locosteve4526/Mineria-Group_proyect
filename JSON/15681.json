        "Description/Abstract": "Regularized solutions of ill-posed inverse problems can be viewed as solutions of the original problem when the problem is regularized by adding statistical information to it. The discrepancy principle finds a regularization parameter by applying a chi-square test, and we extend and improve the approach to estimate a regularization matrix. This regularization matrix can be viewed as an estimate of an error covariance matrix. Results will be shown from an event reconstruction problem. ",
