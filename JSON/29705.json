        "Description/Abstract": "In this article, we note that mediation is an effective method for resolving conflicts and has been utilized worldwide. Despite extensive research on the process, scholars do not understand why mediators employ the techniques that they do. To address this deficiency, we draw upon the control model as an organizing theoretical framework and present predictions for the effects of eight factors (disputant aspirations, stage of the mediation, inadequate progress, previous use of pressing, mediator\u2019s power, disputants\u2019 flexibility, culture, and dispute type) upon one set of techniques\u2014mediators\u2019 pressing. Subsequently, we discuss the practical and theoretical implications of our predictions.",
