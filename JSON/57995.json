        "Description/Abstract": "Why translate in education? English-language educational research provides little evidence to suggest that translation is important or beneficial. If the object of such research is empirical and quantitative as it so often is then it is not even necessarily dependent on any single set of linguistic representations or language. It instead speaks through numbers, graphs and charts. In this context, translation appears as an exception, as a way of making contributions of uncommon figures like Paulo Freire or Jean Piaget accessible from Portuguese or French. This chapter argues, however, that the potential value of translation in education is not a matter of access or even of cross-cultural communication. Instead, it is arguably nothing less than a question of finding a language for education that is itself explicitly educational rather than one that is primarily psychological, sociological, philosophical or historical in nature.",
