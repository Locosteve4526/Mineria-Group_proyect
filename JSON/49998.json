        "Description/Abstract": "Dr. Snelson and Dr. Hsu did a presentation for EDTECH doctoral students as part of their seminar course. They talked about their &quot;online first&quot; TechTrends article on the topic of 360 degree video and virtual reality (VR). 360 degree videos are now common on sites like YouTube with options for viewing alone or in VR mode. 360 degree video offers a greater field of view and potential for interactivity beyond what we have with traditional video. A scoping review of the literature was conducted to map the emerging research literature about educational applications of this newer form of video.  Research on 360 video has been conducted in various disciplines including business, marine biology, psychology, religious studies, sports, surgical education, teacher education, and writing. Potential benefits and challenges will be discussed.",
