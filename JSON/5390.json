        "Description/Abstract": "Using the thermodynamic expression for the Soret coefficient for diluted  mixtures, expressed through the temperature derivative of the molecule  chemical potential at the constant pressure, statistical mechanics is  applied to relate this expression to the microscopic molecular  parameters. When the contribution of the internal degrees of freedom in  molecules is accounted for in the calculations, the results are  equivalent to previous approaches, adding new terms to the Soret  coefficient. These terms are related to the differences in molecular  vibration and rotation between the solute and solvent molecules. These &quot;internal&quot; contributions to molecular thermodiffusion explain the  isotopic effect observed in molecular systems. The theory describes most  of the experimental data on the thermodiffusion of isolated molecules  placed in non-electrolyte liquids. The approach also reveals a strong  dependence of molecular thermodiffusion on molecular symmetry.",
