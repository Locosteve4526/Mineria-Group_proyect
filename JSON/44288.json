        "Description/Abstract": "Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury, especially among young children, teenagers, and young adults, is a significant problem in Ada County, Idaho, and the United States. Although much has been learned about concussion, considerable controversy and gaps in knowledge still exist in many areas of research, leading to variation in concussion assessment, treatment, and management protocols. Health systems can positively impact concussion outcomes through community education and outreach, and provision of timely, coordinated, evidence-based clinical care. Collectively, these measures serve to reduce concussion incidence (primary prevention), enable more timely recognition of concussion by parents, coaches, and teachers of youth athletes (secondary prevention), and improve treatment of concussion after it has occurred (tertiary prevention). Using the concussion prevention and clinical care coordination activities of St. Luke's Health System in Idaho as a benchmark, this analysis estimates the economic value of these preventive measures, in particular those preventive measures that target the pediatric population, for Ada County and the state of Idaho, and includes both year of injury and long-term costs of concussion. This study adopts a societal perspective, incorporating savings in direct medical, indirect, and quality of life costs.",
