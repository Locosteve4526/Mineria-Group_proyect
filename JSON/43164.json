        "Description/Abstract": "Advanced austenitic steels (SSs) with excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance are desired to improve the safety margin and thermal efficiency of nuclear power plants. NF709 (20Cr-25Ni-MoTiNb) and D9 (14Cr-15Ni-MoTiMn) are two variants of SSs showing satisfactory high-temperature mechanical properties, which are being developed for advanced nuclear power applications. This work presents a systematic study of the neutron-irradiation-induced microstructural evolution in the two SSs and the resultant mechanical property changes. The irradiation was conducted at the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) within a nominal temperature range of 430 \u2013 680 oC and a dose range of 3.22 \u2013 9.16 displacements per atom (dpa). Advanced analytical transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize radiation-induced boundary segregation, dislocation loops, void formation, and changes in precipitation, which are then correlated with mechanical properties probed using nanoindentation technique. Both alloys showed a positive correlation between the material hardness and radiation dose, as a result of defect accumulation. While the NF709 samples showed more significant hardening at lower temperatures, the peak hardening for the D9 sample occurred at its highest irradiation temperature, 680 oC, which is attributable to the heterogeneous precipitation of Ni/Si-rich clusters. To the authors\u2019 best knowledge, this observation has not been reported before. Besides the efforts to quantitatively correlate the irradiation hardening with the microstructural development, the influence of temperature and materials composition on their radiation responses will also be discussed. The outcome of this study not only provides new understanding to the microstructural evolution of advanced SSs under neutron irradiation, but also paves the way to an improved predictive capability of the degradation of SSs in nuclear reactors.",
