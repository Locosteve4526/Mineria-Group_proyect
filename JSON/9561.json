This paper makes some preliminary comments on animals in Freud\u2019s writings and the practicality of incorporating Lacan\u2019s concept of the objet petit a for resolving a longstanding debate within nonhuman philosophy regarding Heidegger\u2019s conception of the Thing and Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s claim regarding the productive agency (allure) of things.
