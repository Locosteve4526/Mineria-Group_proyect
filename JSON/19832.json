        "Description/Abstract": "A survey of 163 human resource (HR) professionals from eight Society for Human Resource Management chapters in Texas revealed high security and reliability were the leading human resource information system (HRIS) capabilities in their organizations.  Integration with other information systems was the lowest ranked capability and the highest ranked problem.  Other highly ranked problems include user complaints, bugs, and difficult upgrade cycles.  Three quarters of respondents had an HRIS and about sixty percent of them had commercial systems.  Based on a factor analysis of HRIS capability variables, quality and cost appeared to be two major factors.",
