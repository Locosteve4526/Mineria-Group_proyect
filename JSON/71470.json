        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;This study examines technology transfer (TT) as a mechanism for firms to obtain the capabilities they need to thrive; especially when firms are unable to develop the technologies organically. Despite its importance, extant literature does not provide a clear account of how such transfers unfold. Notably missing is an understanding of how firm-, industry-, or regulatory-level path dependencies hinder or foster TT. Following an abductive research design referencing three renewable energy firms, we draw on the dynamic capability (DC) view to elucidate how DCs enable TT and how firm-, industry- and regulatory-level path dependencies influence this process. We contribute insights into how firms either break from existing paths at these three levels by deploying TT-specific DCs in an explorative fashion or leverage them by deploying these DCs in exploitative ways.&lt;/p&gt;",
