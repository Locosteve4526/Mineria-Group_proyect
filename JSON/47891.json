        "Description/Abstract": "M. Randall Holmes\n\nBoise State University\n\nNF is consistent\n\nIn two successive one hour talks, I will give a brief account of the NF consistency problem, explain why consistency of NF follows from the existence of something called\na &quot;tangled web of cardinals&quot; in a model of ZFA, then give the barest hint of a Frankel-Mostowski construction of a model of ZFA in which there is a tangled web.  The third goal is difficult and the degree of success to be expected should not be overrated.",
