        "Description/Abstract": "f we have a different and generalisable post \u2013 or hyper \u2013 modern conjuncture of these flows called body, then, as media researchers interested in how this generalisable experience is imbricated with media, we would like to turn to a media theory account of modernity to gain purchase on the present \u2013 and suggest that the work of Friedrich Kittler on literature, together with theories of the pre-modern, gothic body, provide an opportunity to outline a generalisable mediatised body of the present.",
