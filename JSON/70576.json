        "Description/Abstract": "Your Family, Friends, and Neighbors was an umbrella organization dedicated to raising LGBTQ+ visibility in Idaho in the 1990s, and Boise State's Albertsons Library Special Collection holds the papers for the group. One subsidiary, Idaho for Human Diginity, worked to defeat Idaho's Proposition 1 (1994) that sought to prevent extending minority status to gay and lesbian individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This archival research project sheds light on this effort and examines the rhetorical strategies employed in the campaign to defeat Proposition 1.",
