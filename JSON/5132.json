        "Description/Abstract": "Norms that do exist, such as those published in the &quot;Essentials of Strength and Conditioning,&quot; are from small studies, and there is a need for continual updating. *We also need more research about using service-learning projects to give students practical experience working with clients to develop sport-enhancing fitness programs. Since there are very few training studies being conducted with males or females, service-learning provides a great opportunity for students to design, implement, and evaluate strength and conditioning projects. *According to Kraemer (2009), there is a &quot;lack of research that delineates downstream mechanisms&quot; (p. 1 ).",
