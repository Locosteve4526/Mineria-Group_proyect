        "Description/Abstract": "Audio/video discussion has been increasingly used in online courses due to its affordances to enhance online communication. However, whether learners of different characteristics can all benefit from this type discussion format has not been studied extensively. In this study, we examined whether gender plays a role in learners\u2019 preferences and perceptions on audio/video discussion. 36 graduate students in an Educational Technology program participated and their perceptions have been collected after they experienced an audio/video discussion activity. The findings show that females preferred audio/video discussion more than males did, and more females felt that audio/video discussion connected them better with their peers. The findings in this study could provide implications for sound pedagogical decisions that meet students\u2019 preferences. ",
