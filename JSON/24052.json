        "Description/Abstract": "An ion thruster for small satellites is under development. The thruster uses an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) generated by a flat spiral antenna for the ion source. The antenna is fabricated using the Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC) materials system. The antenna has been modeled using COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae simulation software. The antenna operating frequency range (600 MHz to 1 GHz) in LTCC (?r=7.8) results in a wavelength on the same order of magnitude as the total length of conductor in the antenna. An analysis of the antenna's behavior is presented",
