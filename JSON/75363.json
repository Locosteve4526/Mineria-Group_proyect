        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;BACKGROUND: The recent AACN Essentials revision emphasizes direct clinical experiences across 4 spheres of care in RN-B education, creating challenges for online, asynchronous programs. Differentiating between prelicensure and post-licensure education complicates the integration of these requirements. Understanding RN-B faculty needs is crucial for curricular transformation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;PURPOSE: This needs assessment examines challenges faced by RN-Baccalaureate (RN-B) faculty in integrating the updated American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) Essentials into nursing curricula and provides resources critical for the transition to the 2021 Essentials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;METHODS: A web-based needs assessment was conducted with RN-B faculty across the United States. It included 5 quantitative questions, a demographic questionnaire, and 3 qualitative items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;RESULTS: The assessment revealed a need for enhanced academic support, resources, communication, and collaboration to facilitate implementation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;CONCLUSION: This article offers insights, recommendations, and resources for RN-B faculty engaged in curricular transformation, emphasizing targeted support for adopting the AACN Essentials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;KEYWORDS: Curricular change, nursing education, NCLEX crosswalk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
