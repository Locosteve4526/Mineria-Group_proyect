        "Description/Abstract": "Scarlet the paint tube is born in a world fraught with sectarian violence and blames its fellow colors for the death of its parents. Scarlet sets off on a path of revenge and leads an army of Reds into battle with one goal in mind: Cleanse the world of other colors. As the Reds vanquish their enemies and celebrate their conquest, they become aware of the different shades that exist within their own community. A civil war ensues. The Maroons attack the Vermilions and the Burgundies kill the Crimsons. As the conflict reaches its bloody conclusion, Scarlet becomes the sole survivor of the war. Standing alone on the battlefield, surrounded by dead paint tubes, Scarlet finally grasps the true cost of revenge.",
