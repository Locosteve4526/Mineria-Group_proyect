In nursing programs at all levels of education and practice, there is a gap in education courses to introduce the history, philosophy, theories of Holistic nursing utilizing a combination of on-ground and online program.     Upper level course electives in Holistic Nursing may increase awareness of holistic health practices within the academic and practice settings within nursing programs globally. An interactive presentation of the content and design of the Holistic Nursing Care elective course will be presented, discussed and demonstrated. \n",
