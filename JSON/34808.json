        "Description/Abstract": "To reach faculty that don\u2019t regularly engage in professional development around teaching, we developed the \u201cSparkshop\u201d, a 15 minute, active-learning based workshop that can be facilitated in a department meeting. Each Sparkshop asks faculty members to look at data supporting the use of a certain evidence-based instructional practice (EBIP), has them try out the teaching practice, and then allows them to discuss with disciplinary colleagues how to integrate that approach into their courses. This session is structured to mirror the format of the Sparkshop, giving attendees opportunities to both participate in a Sparkshop and develop one for their own institution.  ",
