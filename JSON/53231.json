        "Description/Abstract": "Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a most common source of concrete deterioration\nworldwide. Global warming (GW) has anticipated frequent climate change and caused global extreme weather events recent years. These events convey potential threats to infrastructure made by concrete due to ASR. That\u2019s why complex mechanisms of ASR under seasonal change and dynamic global warming impacts require a precise quantitative assessment to guide the durable infrastructure materials design practices. Given the set of facts, this work captures the concrete meso-structure and develops a simplified ASR model that integrates chemo-physio-mechanical damage under stochastic weather impact. The results from the validated model elucidate that ASR\nkinetics and evolution of ASR expansion can be more destructive under the influence of global warming and stochastic weather change. Thus, this proposed model can support precise long-term degradation forecasts of concrete infrastructure damage subject to alkali-silica reaction due to global warming and climate change impacts. ",
