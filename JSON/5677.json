        "Description/Abstract": "Cyrtandra comprises at least 600 species distributed throughout  Malesia, where it is known for many local endemics and in Polynesia and Micronesia, where it is present on most  island groups, and is among the most successfully dispersing genera of  the Pacific.                         To ascertain the origin of the oceanic Pacific  island species of Cyrtandra, we sequenced the internal  transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA of samples from throughout  its geographical range.                         Because all oceanic Pacific island species form a  well-supported clade, these species apparently result from a single  initial                         colonization into the Pacific, possibly by a  species from the eastern rim of SE Asia via a NW-to-SE stepping stone  migration.                         Hawaiian species form a monophyletic group,  probably as a result of a single colonization. The Pacific island clade  of Cyrtandra dispersed across huge distances, in contrast to  the apparent localization of the SE Asian clades. Although highly  vagile,                         the Pacific clade is restricted to oceanic  islands. Individual species are often endemic to a single island,  characteristic                         of the &quot;supertramp&quot; life form sensu Diamond  (1974, Science 184: 803\u2013806). The evolution of fleshy fruit within Cyrtandra provided an adaptation for colonization throughout the oceanic Pacific via bird dispersal from a single common ancestor.",
