        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0The size and severity of wildfires around the world have been on the rise since the 1980s. In the USA alone, over 66,000 wildland fires occurred in 2022. Thousands of firefighters were employed to control these fires. The occupational health and safety risks associated with wildland firefighting are significant and numerous. The most common are physical injury, exposure to smoke and other particulates, and heat stress. This project was undertaken to develop a prototype technology that will be able to protect wildland firefighters from excessive exposure to smoke and particulates in the air while also reducing heat stress. A portable, lightweight air filtration system for use by wildland firefighters has been developed. The system consists of a battery-powered variable-speed air filter system that supplies air to a firefighter\u2019s helmet. Multiple air ducts channel filtered air into the firefighter\u2019s helmet. Two ducts provide air to the breathing zone while the other two direct filtered air inside the helmet in the space between the suspension system and the shell. This air flow promotes sweat evaporation from the head. The two air supply systems are operated independently of each other. The system provides a comfortable, unobtrusive, and simple solution for reducing occupational exposure to smoke and other particulates while also reducing firefighter heat stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keywords: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Wildland firefighter health, Respiratory protection, Heat stress reduction, Prototype technology.&lt;/p&gt;",
