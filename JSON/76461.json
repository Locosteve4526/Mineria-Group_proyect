        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Play, though often regarded as insignificant or infantile, can be a powerful way to approach the serious work we do as instructors. How can we harness the power of play to support student learning and to (perhaps) re-engage as instructors post-Covid? An exploration of the rhetorical significance of play offers a foundation from which to understand that although play is often dismissed as superficial, play is serious work. Play is misinterpreted as wish-fulfillment, as a fiction, as competitive, as the direct opposite of seriousness, and chaos. However, examining Huzinga\u2019s (2014) theories of play reveals how play has generative power that constructs knowledge.Through examples of active classroom practices including service learning, examining the complications of play in sports stories, through experiential learning, play-based classroom activities, and applications of Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi\u2019s concept of flow (1996) in reflective multimodal composing, this panel invites a discussion of \u201cplayful\u201d ideas, issues, engagement, and approaches in the classroom, our institutions, our communities, and beyond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
