        "Description/Abstract": "Lysenin, a 297 amino acid pore-forming protein extracted from the coelomic fluid of the earthworm E. foetida,  inserts constitutively open large conductance channels in natural and  artificial lipid membranes containing sphingomyelin. The inserted  channels show voltage regulation and slowly close at positive applied  voltages. We report on the consequences of slow voltage-induced gating  of lysenin channels inserted into a planar Bilayer Lipid Membrane (BLM),  and demonstrate that these pore-forming proteins constitute memory  elements that manifest gating bi-stability in response to variable  external voltages. The hysteresis in macroscopic currents dynamically  changes when the time scale of the voltage variation is smaller or  comparable to the characteristic conformational equilibration time, and  unexpectedly persists for extremely slow-changing external voltage  stimuli. The assay performed on a single lysenin channel reveals that  hysteresis is a fundamental feature of the individual channel unit and  an intrinsic component of the gating mechanism. The investigation  conducted at different temperatures reveals a thermally stable reopening  process, suggesting that major changes in the energy landscape and  kinetics diagram accompany the conformational transitions of the  channels. Our work offers new insights on the dynamics of pore-forming  proteins and provides an understanding of how channel proteins may form  an immediate record of the molecular history which then determines their  future response to various stimuli. Such new functionalities may  uncover a link between molecular events and macroscopic processing and  transmission of information in cells, and may lead to applications such  as high density biologically-compatible memories and learning networks.",
