        "Description/Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease with no cure. An interdisciplinary care model is the treatment standard for patients with ALS (PALS). An interprofessional ALS clinic provides PALS and their families with evidence-based care that focuses on improved quality of life and optimization of medical services. This lightening talk will highlight how an interprofessional group of providers serving in an out-patient ALS clinic shifted their practice during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure patients and their families received the care and guidance needed to navigate their disease process. The clinic team is composed of professionals from neurology, speech language pathology, respiratory care, nutrition, occupational therapy, physical therapy, social work, pharmacy, equipment specialist, and nursing (representing the ALS Association). Our discussion will provide the audience with a modified telehealth model that could be replicated within their own interprofessional clinic setting. This IP team was able to maintain continuity of care and meaningful connections with our PALS during an unprecedented time, through interviewing, screening, remote assessment, debriefing, and follow ups with patients and primary caregivers. As vaccinations became available to healthcare providers and specific patient populations, we responded by shifting to a hybrid model. Many PALS and their caregivers expressed gratitude for the telehealth option as they were fearful to attend an in-person visit, but hesitant to miss a clinical appointment due to their multifaceted needs. Additionally, as the condition progresses, traveling to an office, pandemic or not, becomes a significant burden for PALS and their caregivers. As things return to a new-normal, modified telehealth should be considered as a viable option for those taking care of PALS in order to maintain the delivery of services, obtain the essential equipment in this patient population, and provide caregiver support.",
