        "Description/Abstract": "The study of regionalism has long been an important element of scholarly work in both Canada and the United States. This point is made clear by James Bickerton's observation that regionalism &quot;is a pervasive feature of Canadian society and politics&quot; (1999, 209) and Daniel Elazar's assertion that the study of regionalism and political culture in the United States is meaningful because the very expression of social, economic, and political differences along geographic lines is considered to be &quot;part and parcel of American political life&quot; (1998, xix). And while it is true that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to definitively locate regions as cultural or political spaces (Bickerton 1999, 218), it is also true-as noted by Carlos Schwantes-that at some point those studying regionalism must decide where to draw the boundaries (1996, 2).",
