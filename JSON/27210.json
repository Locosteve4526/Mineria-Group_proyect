        "Description/Abstract": "Two constructions in Northern Paiute (Western Numic; Uto-Aztecan)\u2014the secondary verb construction and the instrumental prefix construction\u2014are described in detail with regard to their place within a typology of multi-verb constructions. Both are compositionally asymmetrical\u2014that is, the defining member of the construction is from a restricted set.  Converbs and verb-verb compounding are both, in theory, symmetrical in composition\u2014that is, there is no restriction on which verbs may enter into them.  However, we find, upon closer inspection, that predicates of a particular type are most likely to be interpretable as part of a monoclausal versus biclausal converb construction, and that there are also some clear frequency restrictions on which verbs most often appear as part of verb-verb compounds. It is proposed that these restrictions shed further light on the possible historical relationships holding among all four multi-verb construction types.",
