        "Description/Abstract": "Implicit memory is evidenced when a subject benefits from a previous experience without making a conscious effort to recollect that prior experience. In the present study, I examined the sensitivity of implicit memory to two variables: type of input processing and the temporal placement of the implicit memory test. Results indicated that although implicit memory occurred in all conditions, its magnitude was sensitive to both variables. The results are discussed in terms of the underlying nature of implicit memory, including the role of transfer-appropriate processing.",
