        "Description/Abstract": "Exhibition curatorial, catalog/brochure project with Fonda Portales, University Art Curator and Collections Manager, and Gwyn Hervochon, Librarian and Archivist, to design an exihibition originally entitled, Curators in Common: Tom Trusky and James Castle to be displayed in the Albertsons Library in Spring 2018 and coinciding with the opening of the Boise State Tom Trusky Research Papers Collection, as well as the City of Boise\u2019s James Castle House. We intially worked toward grouping four full length essays as content in a fully designed color catalog, but had to scale back these efforts due to changes in the Campus Operations budget for the project, and challenges with permissions and our curatorial concept with the Idaho run James Castle Collection &amp; Archive.",
