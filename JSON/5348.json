        "Description/Abstract": "Some of the covering properties of spaces as defined in Parts I and II are here characterized by games. These results, applied to function spaces Cp(X) of countable tightness, give new characterizations of countable fan tightness and countable strong fan tightness. In particular, each of these properties is characterized by a Ramseyan theorem.",
