        "Description/Abstract": "This article contributes to the literature on corporate governance and corporate sustainability by examining South Africa\u2019s experiment in aligning corporate law with constitutional principles.  South Africa has built legal infrastructure in the form of its Constitution and Companies Act that could leverage corporate governance, specifically the duties of directors, as a force to serve societal interests.  However, the state of South Africa\u2019s statutory and common law holds uncertainties that could derail the country\u2019s attempt to align corporate law with constitutional law.  We assess the current state of South Africa\u2019s constitutional and company law and identify potential interpretive streams open to the South African judiciary as it builds the nation\u2019s common law.  We conclude that, while South Africa has created much of the necessary legal infrastructure for alignment, it faces major challenges to interpreting company law in a manner that fulfills the promise of aligning it with the Constitution.",
