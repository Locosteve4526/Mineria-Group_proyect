        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Person-centered language (PCL) has become a well-known approach to reducing stigmatizing labels among marginalized groups. However, little research has explored PCL's impact in criminal justice classrooms. Utilizing a mixed method, quasi-experimental design, this study examined PCL's effect on students\u2019 thoughts and perceptions of individuals convicted of sex offenses. The study used two-course sections of an online, asynchronous class focused on sex offenses and individuals who have committed these offenses. The two-course sections were identical, except for the language used; the control group section did not utilize PCL, while the treatment group section utilized PCL throughout all course materials. Quantitative data was collected from students completing the Perceptions of Sex Offenders Scale at the beginning and end of the semester. Students\u2019 end-of-the-semester reflection papers served as the qualitative component. Findings from both the quantitative and qualitative data sources are integrated to provide a holistic understanding of how language impacted students' views towards this highly stigmatized population. Practical recommendations, limitations, and suggestions for future directions are discussed.&lt;/span&gt;",
