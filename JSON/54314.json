        "Description/Abstract": "In this article the authors use the current surge of populist fervor in many parts of the world as an occasion to rethink some dominant views in contemporary Critical Theory about populism and the structure of society.  Engaging Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, Hegelian and Husserlian phenomenology, and debates between Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj Zizek, the authors argue for a more fundamental role for agonal acts of desire and enjoyment over contracts of reason in the prevailing theories of society and populism.  Focusing on the subject of desire in this way helps understand the play of ideologies in our times as heavily marked by signs of embodiment and temporality and arranged around unconscious enjoyment or jouissance.",
