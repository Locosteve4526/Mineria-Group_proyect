        "Description/Abstract": "A primary consideration of service provision is that it meets the needs of those utilizing the services. Assessing the availability of, and satisfaction with, crime victim services is important to service development, implementation, and funding recommendations. Through a contract funded by the Idaho Council on Domestic Violence and Victim Assistance, a team of faculty and graduate students from Boise State University\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice is in the process of completing a statewide victim services needs assessment. One important component of this needs assessment has been site visits with service providers across the state in order to provide them an opportunity to share their successes, frustrations, and needs. In this roundtable we will be discussing these qualitative findings and their implications for victim services in a rural state.",
