        "Description/Abstract": "John Keats famously praised Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cnegative capability.\u201d Herman Melville lauded his \u201cshort, quick probings at the very axis of reality.\u201d Many marked passages in their surviving copies of Shakespeare\u2019s Dramatic Works hint of these formative conceptions, which significantly influenced their own creative achievements. Study of marginalia is complicated by the fragmentary character of the evidence, which physically marks and conceptually focuses on selected portions of a larger, integrated text. Since the experience of examining marginalia typically lacks the coherence and sequential unity that characterizes study of a work in its totality, methods of computation and data visualization produced from encoded text offer enhanced approaches to evidence. With examples from Keats\u2019s and Melville\u2019s marginalia to Shakespeare\u2019s plays in sets housed at Harvard University\u2019s Houghton Library, this talk will demonstrate some of the ways digital text analysis enriches our understanding of how these two great writers responded to their towering predecessor, and of literary reading and creativity generally.",
