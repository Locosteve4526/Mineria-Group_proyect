        "Description/Abstract": "Introduction\nEarly diagnosis of autism is a public health priority in order to\nprovide a child with intervention options that may help overcome disabling behaviors later. Allowing families to access autism diagnostic services more quickly and conveniently, a research program was conducted to evaluate the convenience and time-saving advantages provided by the smartphone-based NODA telehealth assessment service. Findings of this study will be presented.\n\nMethods\nThree autism centers serving various urban and rural regions of\nthe United States recruited families from surrounding communities\nseeking autism evaluations for their children. Based on random\nassignment after informed consent, a child was evaluated using\neither the traditional In-person Assessment (IPA) method or using\nthe telehealth-based NODA assessment tool. A total of 57 families\nwere included in this study, of which 11 were from rural communities. Families provided social validity data immediately after the assessment period and 3-months after receiving a diagnostic report. \n\nResults\nThe average time required to obtain an autism diagnosis using the In-person Assessment (IPA) method was 118 days. Using the NODA telehealth method, 59 days were required. The difference between the two methods was more pronounced for rural families. Regarding the family social validity associated with the two assessment methods, no significant difference between the NODA telehealth program and the IPA method was experienced, although NODA did experience a higher drop-out rate.\n\nDiscussion\nThe ability of the NODA telehealth system to greatly accelerate an autism assessment provides both the users (caregivers) and the providers (clinicians) with new benefits. While the normal wait-time associated for an in-person assessment (IPA) can be 6 to 9 months\nin the United States, families using the telehealth system are now able to obtain an evaluation much earlier. In addition, the ability by clinicians to review their patients\u2019 recordings multiple times can improve diagnostic consensus. The benefits of telehealth documented in this study confirm the value of remote autism diagnostic services.\n\nKeywords: Childhood, Diagnostic, New Technologies\n\n\n",
