        "Description/Abstract": "UX design infiltrates the practice of technical and professional (TPC) communication because its\u00a0principles align with the goal of TPC to prioritize the needs of the user. UX goals ask the&lt;br&gt;designer to not only consider if the product is usable but also to consider the experience of that\u00a0use through innovative thinking (Tham, 2022). This type of design process requires a hyper\u00a0collaborative relationship with the user and demands the designer relinquish the role of expert to\u00a0center the user in the design space. Accessibility, the process of ensuring equal access to\u00a0technologies and information (Oswal, n.d.), aligns with these UX goals. Both UX and\u00a0accessibility design require the designer to think outside of their own experiences and beyond\u00a0traditional design, which is why the process begins with empathy. UX invites the designer to\u00a0emerge in the perspective of the user with a truly open mind attempting to understand how users\u00a0live in their daily lives (Kelley with Littman, 2005). Using a graduate student technical\u00a0communication course as a backdrop, this chapter offers methods and benefits for instructors to\u00a0place UX principles, accessibility practices, and service learning in concert within the technical\u00a0communication to teach future practitioners the benefit of dispersed power and hyper\u00a0collaboration.&lt;br&gt;In the course, students are challenged to develop accessible designs with a variety of community\u00a0partners with disabilities. Students practice user research methods, including interviewing and\u00a0observation, to understand the access needs these users face in an area of daily living. Students\u00a0use this data and flexible interaction with their users to inform how they define the need, design\u00a0the product, and then evaluate, iterate, and implement their designs. As part of this process,\u00a0students keep reflection journals to capture their own experiences in the UX design space.&lt;br&gt;Students also conference with the instructor at regular intervals.&lt;br&gt;Although there are challenges such as managing community partners, logistics, and scheduling,\u00a0overwhelmingly, the greatest challenge students encountered was the inability to let go of their\u00a0own assumptions regarding access solutions and let the user\u2019s experience guide the design\u00a0process. Students often \u201csolved\u201d the user\u2019s need from their own perspective rather than the lived\u00a0experience of access for the user. The restructuring of the expert/novice relationship is not an\u00a0easy transition for students to accomplish in the classroom environment. The dynamics of the\u00a0classroom typically demand students illustrate their expertise by knowing the \u201cright\u201d method and\u00a0skill to use to design the \u201ccorrect\u201d product. The process of centering the user and asking the&lt;br&gt;student to relinquish the role of expert felt disorienting at times. And yet this dynamic,&lt;br&gt;interactive but sometimes uncomfortable relationship is invaluable to accessible, usable&lt;br&gt;designing.&lt;br&gt;In order to facilitate students\u2019 ability to value and practice their dual role of expert and novice\u00a0requires high-touch guidance from the instructor, which might take the shape of frequent student\u00a0interviews. The goals of these interactions include students recognizing missteps and forming\u00a0pathways to revisit their empathy work, which often meant new research, defining, evaluating\u00a0and iterating. More importantly, these sessions guide students to trust the UX design process and\u00a0to view accessibility as an experience of the user rather than a list of guidelines. With intentional\u00a0guidance, students learn UX is not a clean, formulaic process. It is beautifully messy because it\u00a0engages with the infinite, dynamic diversity of the human experience.",
