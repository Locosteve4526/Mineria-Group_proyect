        "Description/Abstract": "Preschool teachers report children's challenging behavior as their greatest concern (Alkon, Ramler, &amp; MacLennan, 2003; Joseph &amp; Strain, 2003), but estimates show that fewer than 10% of young children who show early signs of problem behavior receive services (Kazdin &amp; Kendall, 1998). These data suggest that preschool teachers do not have the training or resources to implement research-based strategies. The need for effective and efficient behavior support in early childhood is apparent, particularly in light of the long-term negative effects of early problem behavior.",
