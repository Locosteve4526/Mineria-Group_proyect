        "Description/Abstract": "I focus on the notion of \u2018the self\u2019 in educational psychology. The term Bildung is central to this psychology, particularly as it is articulated in Dewey\u2019s early textbook  titled simply \u201cpsychology.\u201d Bildung has been variously translated as edification, formation or growth, and it refers on the one hand to the \u2018developmental formation of an individual\u2019s unique potential through participation in the social practices and institutions of culture\u2019 (Good &amp; Garrison 2007: 44). On the other hand, it also includes the \u201ccultivation of inner life,\u201d the development of subjectivity, as a kind of quality of selfhood, and as a manifestation of its freedom.",
