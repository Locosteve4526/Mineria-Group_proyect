        "Description/Abstract": "Purpose: Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin\nand daunorubicin, continue to be widely used in the treatment of cancer, although they share the adverse e?ect of chronic, cumulative dose-related cardiotoxicity. The only approved treatment in prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity is dexrazoxane, a putative iron chelator. Previous in vitro studies have shown that disorders of iron metabolism, including altered IRP1\u2013IRE binding, may be an important mechanism of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Methods: This study examined the role of IRP1\u2013IRE binding ex vivo in a chronic model of daunorubicin cardiotoxicity in the Fischer 344 rat and whether dexrazoxane could prevent any daunorubicin-induced changes in IRP1 binding. Young adult (5\u20136 months) Fischer 344 rats received daunorubicin (2.5 mg/kg iv once per week for 6 weeks) with and without pretreatment with dexrazoxane (50 mg/kg ip). Other groups received saline (controls) or dexrazoxane alone. Rats were killed either 4 h or 2 weeks after the last dose of daunorubicin to assess IRP1\u2013IRE binding. Results: Contractility (dF/dt) of atrial tissue, obtained from rats 2 weeks after the last dose of daunorubicin, was signi?cantly reduced in daunorubicin-treated compared to control rats. Dexrazoxane pretreatment protected against the daunorubicin-induced decrease in atrial dF/dt. However, left ventricular IRP1/IRE binding was not affected by daunorubicin treatment either 4 h or 2 weeks after the last dose of daunorubicin. Conclusions: IRP1 binding may not be altered in the rat model of chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity.",
