Literature that is beautifully written, with multidimensional characters who invite the reader into their lives to laugh, cry, and dream with them, should line the shelves of every classroom library. For this themed issue of Language Arts, Locating Standards, we have compiled a list of award- winning children's literature that exceeds curriculum standards and embodies characteristics that raise the literary imagination.",
