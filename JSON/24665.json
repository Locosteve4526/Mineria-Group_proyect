        "Description/Abstract": "&quot;The term \u201copenness,\u201d however, can be understood in a wide variety of ways. \nIn the context of open software and content in particular, openness has been \ncharacterised and defined in different ways. As early as 1986, Richard Stallman, \nfounder of the Free Software Foundation, emphasised the importance of being \nable to have the ability to \u201ccopy,\u201d \u201cdistribute\u201d and \u201cimprove\u201d software, and to \nbe able to \u201cexchange the changes with others\u201d (Stallman 1986, p. 8). These four \nabilities, or \u201cfreedoms\u201d (copying, distribution, changing and distribution of \nchanges), have become a central part of the notion of openness in connection \nwith content generally and Open Educational Resources (OER) in particular.&quot;",
