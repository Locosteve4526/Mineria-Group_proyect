        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\nMethylthioadenosine (MTA) is released as a by-product\nof S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent reactions\ncentral to ethylene, polyamine, or phytosiderophore\nbiosynthesis. MTA is hydrolysed by methylthioadenosine\nnucleosidase (MTN; EC 3.2.2.16) into adenine\nand methylthioribose which is processed through the\nmethionine (Met) cycle to produce a new molecule of\nAdoMet. In deepwater rice, submergence enhances\nethylene biosynthesis, and ethylene in turn influences\nthe methionine cycle through positive feedback regulation\nof the acireductone dioxygenase gene OsARD1.\nIn rice, MTN is encoded by a single gene designated\nOsMTN. Recombinant OsMTN enzyme had a KM for\nMTA of 2.1 mM and accepted a wide array of 5# substitutions\nof the substrate. OsMTN also metabolized\nS-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) with 15.9% the rate\nof MTA. OsMTN transcripts and OsMTN-specific activity\nincreased slowly and in parallel upon submergence,\nindicating that regulation occurred mainly at\nthe transcriptional level. Neither ethylene, MTA, nor\nMet regulated OsMTN expression. Analysis of steadystate\nmetabolite levels showed that MTN activity was\nsufficiently high to prevent Met and AdoMet depletion\nduring long-term ethylene biosynthesis.",
