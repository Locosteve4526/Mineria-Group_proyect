        "Description/Abstract": "The use of incentives by buyers to promote supplier performance is a generally understudied aspect of the buyer-supplier relationship. In this study we attempt to narrow this gap by exploring two alternative approaches available to buyers: cooperative supplier incentives and competitive supplier incentives. We use empirical data to analyze the effect of each approach on different measures of supplier performance and consider the influence of various moderating variables.",
