        "Description/Abstract": "Monitoring and evaluating classroom behavior in early childhood for the purpose of improving teaching and learning is critical. There is a clear link between social behavior and academic learning. Classrooms where students are following expectations, engaging academically, and transitioning effectively between activities are classrooms where students spend more time accessing instruction. In order to make efficient and effective decisions for class-wide supports, data should be collected on the class as a whole. With accurate data, interventions can be implemented for the whole group that will increase instructional time.\n\nIn this paper we propose quick and efficient data collection methods for three key behaviors: following expectations, engagement, and transitions. With minimal disruption and effort, teachers can collect data that will enable them to support appropriate behaviors, ensure that students understand behavioral expectations, maintain an organized environment, improve positive interactions, and decrease the number of students needing intensive, individualized supports.",
