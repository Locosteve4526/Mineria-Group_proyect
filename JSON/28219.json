        "Description/Abstract": "Instant messaging, chat rooms and other forms of synchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) are increasing in use in the business, military, and consumer world. The language action perspective provides methods for analyzing and modelling repeated business conversations including synchronous CMC. This paper describes a method for creating a profiles for large amounts of synchronous CMC conversation after it has occurred. Called a speech act profile, it is based on speech act theory. The profiles can be used either as patterns for classifying conversations or for creating visual maps of the conversations themselves. Application of the profiles in information retrieval and deception detection are discussed. ",
