        "Description/Abstract": "Pedagogical tact has been a topic of significant international interest since it was initially defined by J.F. Herbart in 1802\u2014specifically as a \u201cquick judgment and decision\u201d able to address \u201cthe true requirements of the individual case.\u201d This paper connects such early definitions with more recent accounts, particularly those that stress importance of reserve, of holding back for the sake of the student\u2019s independence. It then explores manifestations of this at once active and passive character of tact in terms of body\u2019s own aporias\u2014its simultaneity as physical and lived (Leib and K\u00f6rper), as a \u201cvisible seer,\u201d as \u201chearing and heard, touching and touched, moving and moved.\u201d By reflecting on an example of pedagogical engagement as shown in a short video clip, this paper develops the conclusion that this dual corporeal character is mirrored in the \u201creserved action\u201d characteristic of pedagogical tact.",
