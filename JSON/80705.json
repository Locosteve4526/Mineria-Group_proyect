        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Navigating the intricate landscape of U.S. higher education\u00a0can be profoundly challenging for international students. This\u00a0groundbreaking work offers a vital, dual perspective, interweaving\u00a0deeply personal lived experiences with rigorous academic&lt;br&gt;research to illuminate the multifaceted journey of cultural and&lt;br&gt;academic adaptation.\u00a0Beyond the author\u2019s compelling narrative in the preface, the book&lt;br&gt;shares personal stories, making complex challenges tangible and\u00a0relatable. From dissecting the nuances of U.S. grading systems\u00a0and academic culture to exploring complex social integration,\u00a0language proficiency hurdles, and the pervasive challenges of\u00a0\u201cothering\u201d and discrimination, this book provides an honest and\u00a0comprehensive account. A unique focus is placed on the distinct\u00a0barriers faced by female students from conservative cultural\u00a0backgrounds, offering empathetic insight into their unique\u00a0struggles with participation, social norms, and mental well-being.\u00a0Distinguished by its blend of personal narrative and evidence-based solutions, this book transcends mere description. It\u00a0critically examines the role of institutional support, advocating\u00a0for culturally sensitive mentorship, inclusive classroom practices,\u00a0tailored mental health services, and essential cultural competency\u00a0training for faculty and staff.&lt;br&gt;\u2018Cultural Influences and International Students\u2019 is an\u00a0indispensable resource for current and prospective international\u00a0students seeking to understand and prepare for their journey.\u00a0It is also an essential guide for higher education professionals,&lt;br&gt;including faculty, advisors, administrators, and policymakers,&lt;br&gt;providing actionable strategies to foster truly inclusive\u00a0environments. This work stands as a powerful call to action for\u00a0transforming U.S. campuses into spaces where every international\u00a0student can thrive academically and personally.&lt;/p&gt;",
