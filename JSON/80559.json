        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Join us at The Art Museum of Eastern Idaho (TAM) for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gathering: Unity, Dissonance, and the Spaces Between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u2014an exhibition in collaboration with Fonda Portales, University Art Curator and Collections Manager at Boise State University, exploring the many facets of gathering, from community and connection to isolation and division. This dynamic collection brings together works from the Boise State University permanent collection that reflect the ways people, ideas, and natural elements come together\u2014or remain apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The exhibition offers a space for reflection on belonging, community, and the rhythms of gathering, both in human relationships and in the natural world. Through thought-provoking pieces visitors are invited to consider what it means to gather and the spaces that exist between unity and solitude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than just a visual experience, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gathering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; encourages community members to connect and engage in meaningful dialogue. Interactive tours prompt discussion, inviting visitors to actively participate in lieu of passive observation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
