        "Description/Abstract": "In Summer and Fall of 2021, we surveyed over 600 individuals in the Treasure Valley area about their attitudes towards &quot;niceness&quot; and used the Prosocial Tendencies Measures (PTM) survey to begin a historical process of gaging the perceived niceness in the Treasure Valley and motivations for it. The survey was approved by the IRB and conducted in conjunction with the Boise Nice Project (www.boisenice.org) ",
