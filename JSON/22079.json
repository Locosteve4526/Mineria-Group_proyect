        "Description/Abstract": "Location monitoring, the use of devices by firms to determine the location of employees, is becoming more pervasive. Coincident with the increased use of location monitoring is the rapidly growing importance of examining the legal and ethical dimensions of the use of these technologies as well as the growing significance of research on these topics. This study provides an overview of the characteristics and technologies, legal, and ethical issues of location monitoring.  Some legal issues include the compatibility of the use of location monitoring with existing United States laws, including the Electronic Monitoring Communications Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the Age Discrimination Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This study concludes with a discussion of recommended policies regarding employee location monitoring. These are aimed at providing guidance to firms interested in increasing efficiency and profitability through the use of location sensing techniques while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with existing legal protections for employees and conformity of accepted norms of corporate social responsibility. \nRole:  Co-Principal",
