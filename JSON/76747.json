        "Description/Abstract": "The degree distribution of a real world network \u2014 the number of links per node&lt;br&gt;\u2014 often follows a power law, so some hubs have many more links than traditional&lt;br&gt;graph generation methods predict. For years, preferential attachment and growth&lt;br&gt;have been the proposed mechanisms that lead to these scale free networks. How-&lt;br&gt;ever, when two sides of bipartite graphs like collaboration networks are not scale&lt;br&gt;free, they are not well-explained by these processes. Here we develop a bipar-&lt;br&gt;tite extension to the Randomly Stopped Linking Model for generating networks&lt;br&gt;and show that mixtures of geometric distributions can lead to power laws, an&lt;br&gt;intuition suggested by the Central Limit Theorem for distributions with infinite&lt;br&gt;variance. We show that the two halves of the actor-movie network are not scale&lt;br&gt;free and can be represented by just 6 geometric distributions, but they combine&lt;br&gt;to form a scale free actor-actor unipartite projection without preferential attach-&lt;br&gt;ment or growth. This result supports our claim that scale free networks are the&lt;br&gt;natural result of many Bernoulli trials with high variance of which preferential&lt;br&gt;attachment and growth are only one example.",
