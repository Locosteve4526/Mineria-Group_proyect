        "Description/Abstract": "From the early days of internet research, scholars have examined women\u2019s experiences online (e.g., Haas; Hawisher and Sullivan; Jack; Queen; Selfe and Hawisher). One specific concern has been women\u2019s safety, including studies on trolling (Herring, Job-Sluder, Scheckler, and Barab; Rentschler), and safe spaces (Clark-Parsons; Lewis, Sharp, and Remnant). However, less attention has been paid to women\u2019s rhetorical practices for avoiding danger while simultaneously performing politeness. This presentation focuses on such practices for navigating the danger-politeness double bind in social media posts from fans of My Favorite Murder, the true-crime comedy podcast hosted by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark. Since its debut on iTunes in October 2017, the podcast has led to a joint memoir by Kilgariff and Hardstark and a line of merchandise, both of which prominently feature the show\u2019s tagline, Stay Sexy and Don\u2019t Get Murdered (SSDGM). I use Burke\u2019s perspective by incongruity to examine SSDGM and the attendant hashtag as strategies of resistance and solidarity adopted by My Favorite Murder\u2019s creators and fans. Perspective by incongruity is \u201corganized bad taste\u201d (PC 133) that allows audiences to imagine alternatives to the current order of things. I argue that the incongruous pairing of stay sexy with don\u2019t get murdered provides a step toward rejection of the danger-politeness double bind.\u00a0 In particular, #SSDGM serves as shorthand for a constellation of women\u2019s rhetorical practices for resisting dominant discourses about personal safety that inform how women choose to engage with others, online and off.",
