        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fabric flammability is influenced by factors such as composition of the fiber material, the manufacturing process and additional chemical treatments that are applied. These variables make it difficult to predict the nature and intensity of a clothing fire and the risk of injury associated with an exposure to the flames. The severity of an injury will depend on the duration of the exposure and the temperature of the flames. The objective of this investigation was to identify the flaming characteristics of multi-layered fabric samples which has not been reported in literature before. Ninety fabric samples were used in this study including cotton, wool, polyester, nylon and silk. The tests were conducted inside a controlled laboratory environment. The results revealed that fabric flame temperatures, as well as fabric burn-times for wool, polyester, nylon and silk, decreased significantly with the addition of one and two fabric layers. This represents a \u201cprotective factor\u201d against burn injuries. However, the cotton samples exhibited the opposite. An increase in the maximum flame temperature and combustion times were seen when additional layers were applied. Therefore, it is essential to perform flammability tests that inlcude multiple layers of fabric material when assessing the fire injury potenetial of clothing.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key words:&lt;/strong&gt; Clothing fire; fabric layers; injury potential; protective factor&lt;/p&gt;",
