        "Description/Abstract": "This book-length project investigates a key transatlantic metaphor in the long eighteenth-century: the \u201cBook of Nature,\u201d or the idea that the physical landscape can be \u201cread\u201d as a book of spiritual meaning or alternative Scripture in revealing God. While the term is in continuous use from late Antiquity onwards, the term undergoes a crucial transformation from the seventeenth century to the Romantic period, as changes in theology, literature and science radically change the concept of nature and its relation to the individual self.",
