        "Description/Abstract": "This paper puts forth a description of collective learning as an alternative phrase to replace &quot;education&quot; since education is so typically conflated with schooling. Explores the notion of &quot;radical&quot; in its original meaning as that which gets to the core of an issue. And it puts forth the argument that everything done in the name of collective learning needs to be held sacred.\u00a0",
