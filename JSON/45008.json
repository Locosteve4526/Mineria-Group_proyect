        "Description/Abstract": "Decades of research demonstrate that roads impact wildlife and\nsuggest traffic noise as a primary cause of population declines near\nroads. We created a \u201cphantom road\u201d using an array of speakers to\napply traffic noise to a roadless landscape, directly testing the effect\nof noise alone on an entire songbird community during autumn migration.\nThirty-one percent of the bird community avoided the phantom\nroad. For individuals that stayed despite the noise, overall body\ncondition decreased by a full SD and some species showed a change\nin ability to gain body condition when exposed to traffic noise during\nmigratory stopover. We conducted complementary laboratory experiments\nthat implicate foraging-vigilance behavior as one mechanism\ndriving this pattern. Our results suggest that noise degrades habitat\nthat is otherwise suitable, and that the presence of a species does not\nindicate the absence of an impact.",
