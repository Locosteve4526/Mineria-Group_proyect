        "Description/Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of an abstinence education curriculum series on student outcomes. METHODS: The series was taught at upper elementary, junior high, and high school levels. A questionnaire was administered to all intervention and comparison students before and after implementation of the curriculum. RESULTS: At the upper elementary level, the curriculum group had better outcomes on knowledge, self-efficacy, and a more hopeful outlook; at the middle school level no differences; at the high school level, findings favored the curriculum group on attitude, behavioral intent, and sexual behavior variables. CONCLUSION: Results are encouraging and should be considered by those interested in helping young people postpone sexual involvement.",
