        "Description/Abstract": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been particularly challenging for nursing home staff and residents. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services regulation waivers are burdening staff and affecting how care is delivered. Residents are experiencing social isolation, which can result in physical and behavioral health issues, particularly for persons with dementia. These challenges can be addressed in part through technology adaptations. Full integration of electronic health record systems can improve workflow and care quality. Telehealth can improve access to outside providers, provide remote monitoring, and improve social connectedness. Electronic and audiovisual programs can be used for end-of-life planning and information sharing between nursing home staff and families. Online learning systems and other online resources provide flexible options for staff education and training. Investing in and adapting technology can help mitigate workforce stress and improve the quality of nursing home care during and after the COVID-19 crisis.",
