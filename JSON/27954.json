        "Description/Abstract": "\u201cIn this paper, we study a two level method based on Newton\u2019s iteration for the nonlinear system arising from the Galerkin finite element approximation to the equations of motion described by the Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic fluid flow model. The two-grid algorithm is based on three steps. In the first step, the nonlinear system is solved on a coarse mesh TH to obtain an approximate solution uH . In the second step, the nonlinear system is linearized around uH based on Newton\u2019s iteration and the linear system is solved on a finer mesh Th. Finally, in the third step, a correction to the results obtained in the second step is achieved by solving a linear problem with a different right hand side on Th. Optimal error estimates in L?(L2)-norm, when h = O(H2??) and in L?(H1)-norm, when h = O(H5?2?) for velocity and in L?(L2)-norm, when h = O(H5?2?) for pressure are established, where ? &gt; 0 is arbitrarily small for two dimensions and\r\n? = 1/2 for three dimensions.\u201d \r\nExplanation of Other:  Mathematical Reviews",
