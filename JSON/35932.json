        "Description/Abstract": "The overall goal of this workshop will be to develop a full IODP proposal for drilling and related experiments at Axial Seamount. The workshop will bring together a multidisciplinary group of scientists and engineers across a broad spectrum of ocean sciences and engineering to discuss recent engineering advances and practical issues related to drilling into zero-age oceanic crust, and to identify high priority science objectives and research opportunities that can only be achieved with ocean drilling at Axial Seamount.",
