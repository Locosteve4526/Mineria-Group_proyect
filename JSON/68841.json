        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Approximately 97,000 km of wadable streams exist in Idaho\u202falone, with their associated riparian and instream habitat. Most of these\u202fareas are in some stage of degradation\u202facross western North America, but when healthy,\u202fthey disproportionately\u202fcontribute to biodiversity, forage production, and water availability. Enhancing these riparian and mesic habitats through low-tech process base restoration techniques, beaver translocation, and beaver mimicry have gained considerable momentum during the past 5 years, but this approach is still in its infancy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;This one-day meeting aims to build a diverse network of experienced stream restoration practitioners. Desired outcomes of this meeting include: 1: Growing a network in Idaho\u202fand beyond\u202fto better deliver mesic and riparian restoration across jurisdictional boundaries at meaningful scales, 2: Identify the biggest gaps in science and monitoring related to the applicability and implementation of this approach, and 3: Develop a collective path moving forward and follow-up action items for small stream restoration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
