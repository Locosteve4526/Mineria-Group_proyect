        "Description/Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate systems of nonlinear delay differential equations modeling a continuous-time neural network with a time delay. We introduce an iterative scheme, derive convergence estimates and investigate the corresponding solutions for the model equations.\n\nFunctional differential equations applied in neuroscience as well as numerous other areas such as mathematical biology, population dynamics and disease dynamics has been the subject of a breadth of research involving its many different forms, including delay differential equations, neutral differential equations, Volterra integro-differential equations and delay partial differential equations. Examples include higher order functional differential equations, second order impulsive functional differential equations, and infinite systems of functional differential equations.",
