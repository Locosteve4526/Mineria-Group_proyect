        "Description/Abstract": "Henrikson et al. (1998) propose that freshwater shrimp were an important spring resource for aboriginal peoples who moved widely to harvest shrimp that in some instances were taken in lieu of fish. This paper evaluates their arguments and presents findings of an experimental freshwater shrimp harvest and nutritional analysis that suggests that the use of freshwater shrimp was less optimal than proposed.",
