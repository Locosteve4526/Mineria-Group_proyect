        "Description/Abstract": "n The Folding Cliffs, a narrative poem with a novelistic scope, W.S. Merwin reflects on poetic thinking by availing himself of the tools of narrative. He not only depicts historic injustice against indigenous Hawaiians but also tropes the form of his storytelling in order to assess the history it relates and its ethical implications. To promote this assessment, Merwin inculcates a judicious self-questioning in his readers by means of his narrative structure, which emphasizes the discrepancy between plot (discourse) and story (chronology).  In The Folding Cliffs, Merwin pricks his readers\u2019 consciences most effectively by making them aware of the difference between the plot of his protagonist\u2019s story and the sequence of events that compose that plot. By making readers keenly aware of the mechanics of his storytelling, Merwin offers a model of narrative ethics which respects the individual\u2019s alterity.",
