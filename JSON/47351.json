        "Description/Abstract": "Himalayan caterpillar fungus (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) has become one of the world\u2019s most valuable biological commodities due to its use as an ingredient in traditional medicine. Here we provide a dataset of caterpillar fungus locations used in the publication &quot;The demise of caterpillar fungus in the Himalayan region due to climate change and overharvesting.&quot; It includes coordinates for 400 caterpillar fungus locations that we compiled from a systematic literature review and supplemented with new GPS records collected in the field. We used these data to map the current suitable habitat for O. sinensis in order to assess how environmental conditions relate to its production, and how these are affected by climate change.",
