        "Description/Abstract": "Living and working in an increasingly globalized society, university students in the United States need to develop greater cultural awareness and competencies for interacting with people from other countries, including a growing population of refugees settling in their midst (U.S. Department of State, 2008). In an effort to help students develop global perspectives within the borders of the U.S., two education professors from Health Promotion and Bilingual Education have developed and taught Personal Health and Cultural Diversity courses, respectively, incorporating service-learning (SL) projects with local refugee agencies. This paper, designed for faculty interested in developing cultural competencies in students, discusses strategies and techniques for developing SL projects with highly diverse refugee populations.",
