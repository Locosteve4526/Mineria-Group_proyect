        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background: Peripheral air leakage affects the ability of a facemask to protect a wearer from exposure to airborne contaminants. Leakage occurs when air bypasses a mask\u2019s filter material and enters or exits the mask through gaps between the mask and the face. A wearer creates a negative pressure inside the mask during inhalation and a positive pressure during exhalation. These pressure differentials draw air in, or push air out of the mask reducing the effectiveness of a facemask. The goal of this research was to quantify the amount of peripheral leakage associated with four commonly used facemasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods: An air-pressure measurement chamber was developed to simplify mask air leakage assessments. Changes in air pressure and airflow were recorded using a differential manometer and a digital thermoanemometer. Differences between mask airflow and airflow through an open configuration (control) determined the airflow deficit driving peripheral leakage. Four facemask types were tested including a surgical mask, a covid mask, a cotton mask and a N95 mask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results: The data showed leakage similarities among the four mask types tested. The surgical mask exhibited 50% leakage. The covid mask exhibited 67% leakage while the cotton mask exhibited 63%. The N95 mask exhibited a leakage of 72%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions: The results of this study confirm previous studies that show high levels of peripheral leakage associated with most facemasks currently in use. The assessment method described in this study provides a new and simplified method to determine such leakages. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
