        "Description/Abstract": "Multidrug resistant bacteria frequently possess the ability to use a population dependent quorum-sensing (QS) system to regulate gene expression that leads to the expression of virulence factors, toxins and biofilm formation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes two major acyl homoserine lactone QS systems known as RhlI/R and LasI/R.  RhlI and LasI are involved in the bisubstrate conjugation of N-Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), which are converted to the products acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), Holo-ACP and 5-Methylthioadenosine (MTA). We aim to measure the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of LasI synthase substrate analogs to determine what specific LasI-substrate interactions are vital for AHL synthesis.  ",
