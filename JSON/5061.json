        "Description/Abstract": "This work reports the results of an extensive search for ferromagnetism in SnO2 doped with a wide range of transition metal cations (M = V,  Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). By varying the dopant concentration in the  0\u201312% range, signatures of ferromagnetic behavior in varying degrees  were observed with most dopants. The room temperature magnetic moments  per dopant ion were low in all the systems and Co (0.13?B/ion), Fe (0.014?B/ion), and Cr (0.06?B/ion)  showed relatively the strongest ferromagnetic behavior. In these  systems, the observed ferromagnetism initially increased reaching a  maximum in the 1\u201312% range and then gradually weakened and eventually  disappeared at higher concentration. The limiting dopant concentration xL at which ferromagnetic behavior reaches a maximum varies with dopant  type and has a strong relation to structural changes revealed from  detailed x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The XRD data indicated that  the lattice volume for every Sn1?xMxO2 system decreased with increasing x in the 0 ? xL range. However, for x&gt;xL,  the lattice volume increased dramatically indicating a significant  interstitial doping which destroys the ferromagnetic behavior.",
