        "Description/Abstract": "This talk will demonstrate how in situ transmission electron microscopic (TEM) mechanical testing provides deeper insight into deformation mechanisms of irradiated alloys. Ion irradiation produces a dense network of dislocation loops, solute clusters, and other nano/microstructural features in metallic alloys. The resultant nano/microstructure has a sufficiently low characteristic length that the specimen size effect is overcome for TEM-scale specimens. Hence, in situ TEM mechanical testing techniques can simultaneously couple quantitative load-displacement data with qualitative observations of deformation, leading to tremendous advancements in our fundamental understanding of plastic phenomena in irradiated alloys. We will present results from in situ TEM indentation, compression pillars, cantilevers, and 4-point bend tests. The talk will compare and contrast these testing configurations, and demonstrate how each can be leveraged to improve one\u2019s understanding of the irradiation evolution of structure-mechanical property relationships. Work will focus primarily on ion irradiated Fe-9Cr oxide dispersion strengthened steel and Cu-10Ta. ",
