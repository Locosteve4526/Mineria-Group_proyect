        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\nPalliative care is defined by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) as\ntreatment that enhances comfort to improve quality of life (https://www.nhpco.org/about-nhpco/). No\nspecific therapy is excluded from consideration. Palliative care focuses on the needs of the whole\nperson throughout the illness trajectory, rather than focusing only on the disease. Palliative care aims\nto provide the best possible quality of life for patients and their families. As a leading organization\nrepresenting hospice and palliative care providers, NHPCO works to expand access to a proven\nperson-centered model for healthcare. Providing quality care for older patients is one of our biggest\nchallenges in the post-COVID-19 era (Lapid et al., 2020). The World Health Assembly (WHA)\nrecognizes that palliative care, when indicated, is fundamental to improving quality of life, overall\nwell-being, and human dignity for individuals (WHA, 2020). In this paper, we review the literature on\ncaring for the frail elderly and present a case study of an 80-year-old military widow. Then, we\naddress conclusions and implications for best practices in palliative care from an interdisciplinary\napproach.\nKey Words: Palliative care, frailty, elderly, biopsychosocial emotional support, spiritual care,\ninterdisciplinary approach\n",
