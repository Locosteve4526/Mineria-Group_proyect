        "Description/Abstract": "   The pedagogical relation is given its canonical description in a text from 1933 by Herman Nohl, who drew inspiration from Friedrich Schleiermacher. Nohl\u2019s text describes this relation as first of all taken on by the adult for the sake of the child; it is informed by what is best for the child both now and in the future. This relation demands a tactfulness that can be protective of both educator and educand (i.e. child or young person). However, it comes without the expectation that it is to be reciprocated. Finally, it is marked by an asymmetrical pathos, Nohl says that this consists in the child\u2019s loyalty to the adult, and the adult\u2019s love for the child, and is oriented to the child\u2019s present reality and future possibility.\n   \n   I extend Nohl\u2019s account by turning to a contemporary discussion of the child as \u201calien.\u201d The alterity and heterogeneity of this \u201calienness\u201d that children confront us with, I argue, is not characterized by the broad symmetry of the self and other (perhaps familiar from Levinas). Instead, it constituted through an act of exclusion and disappearance that is intrinsically involved in what Husserl calls our \u201csphere of ownness\u201d (1960, p. 92) Our relation to this alien is thus not characterized by a logic or language that both share. Instead, it is manifest through pathos that is lived in an immanent indexical field of experience. It is here where we are addressed by the child or young person, and it is here where we respond to that which withdraws when we would try to assimilate them to our own selves and understandings.",
