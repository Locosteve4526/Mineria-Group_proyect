        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Decision making is an important skill that can be developed through well-designed learning experiences. Expert decision makers rely on an extensive content knowledge base and use different strategies from novice decision makers. People make systematic errors in their decision-making process. Normative decision-making approaches are helpful for novices, while naturalistic approaches are regularly used by experts. Effective decision-making training involves access to strong mental models, deliberate practice, quality feedback, and appropriately challenging tasks. In this chapter, the authors review key ideas related to effective human decision making.&lt;/span&gt;",
