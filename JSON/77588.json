        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Background: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarettes are the most common form of nicotine consumption among youth in the United &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;States. There is a lack of research focusing on e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarette use among multiracial youth, yet the sparse literature points &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;toward the adverse consequences of e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarettes on multiracial youth. Multiracial youth tend to have higher addiction &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and prevalence rates of e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarette use compared to other racial/ethnic groups. The current research focuses on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;analyzing e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarette use based on parental factors, school factors, prosocial behavior, ease of access, risk behaviors, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;perception of harm, and sociodemographic differences among multiracial youth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Methods:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A secondary data analysis of the 2020 Student Drug Use Survey (N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;048) was performed. Of these, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;3340 self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;identified as multiracial. Descriptive analysis, univariate logistic regression, and logistic regression were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;performed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results indicate that the odds of using e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarettes among multiracial youth increase 2 times when not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;perceived as harmful, 2 times if one is employed, 18 times if involved in high&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;risk behaviors, and 2 times if in 9th through &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;12th grade. Additionally, logistic regression demonstrates that parental factors may not be significant in e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarette use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;among multiracial youth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is crucial to investigate the association between e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarette use and multiracial youth, as they may &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;be disproportionately affected by chronic conditions and fatal diseases linked to tobacco use. Understanding the specific &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;risk and protective factors influencing e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cigarette use within this demographic can help design targeted interventions, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;particularly for multiracial youth in the Greater Cincinnati region.&lt;/span&gt;",
