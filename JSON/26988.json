        "Description/Abstract": "The demographic transition is the change from a high-mortality, high-fertility population to one with low-mortality and low-fertility, which tends to accompany industrialization.  Evolutionary anthropologists are particularly interested in studying the demographic transition because low levels of fertility, as experienced around the world today, appear inconsistent with the expectation of fitness maximization, and researchers seek to understand the factors influencing people\u2019s fertility behavior.  The demographic transition began in Western Europe and has spread to the entire world. While Demographic Transition Theory has the power to explain mortality and fertility change, it is yet unable to predict the timing or duration of transition.   ",
