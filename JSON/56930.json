The design of the study was mixed methods descriptive survey research. Components of the Academic Motivations Scale (AMS)- College Version were used to assess the construct, as well as open-ended questions that allowed for narrative student responses related to pressures of the pandemic, regulation of motivation, and faculty support. One-hundred twenty-three students completed components of the survey. Respondents were both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated to continue to pursue their advanced degree despite the pandemic. Students self-identified as being determined to achieve their goals; support from family, friends, colleagues and faculty helped them achieve their goals; and flexibility of instructors helped to ensure student success during the pandemic. Despite the pandemic, Respiratory Therapy (RT) students pursuing an advanced degree are self-determined and have a genuine love of learning, which helps to regulate their motivation to continue. DA students in Respiratory Care appreciated instructors who were flexible and supportive in meeting their academic needs. ",
