        "Description/Abstract": "Hypothermia on intensive care unit (ICU) admission after cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass is common. It contributes to postoperative complications including shivering, coagulopathy, increased blood loss and transfusion requirements, morbid cardiac events, metabolic acidosis, increased wound infections, and prolonged hospital length of stay. The current standard of care for rewarming ICU patients is forced air warming blankets. However, high-quality evidence on additional benefit rendered by other warming methods, such as heated humidified breathing circuits (HHBC), is lacking. Therefore, the authors conducted a pilot study to examine whether the addition of HHBC to standard forced air warming blankets in hypothermic patients (\u226435\u00b0C) admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass reduced time to normothermia.",
