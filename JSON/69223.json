        "Description/Abstract": "Often, small businesses do not possess the resources to have an HR department. In fact, &lt;br&gt;small businesses are often led by busy managers from whom HR tasks drain time and &lt;br&gt;energy. Therefore, small businesses need to understand how engagement in HR practices &lt;br&gt;may impact firm performance. In this paper we add to existing knowledge by examining &lt;br&gt;how higher performing small businesses differ from lower performing small businesses in &lt;br&gt;terms of breadth (the number of HR practices engaged) and depth (engagement in active &lt;br&gt;recruitment strategies) of HR practices. Our findings indicate that higher-performing &lt;br&gt;small businesses tend to apply more breadth and depth in their HR approach than &lt;br&gt;lower-performing small businesses.",
