        "Description/Abstract": "The first speaker will outline the history and current context of the technical communication service course and how the program navigated the challenges of changing institutional requirements. When the course was under review by the general education program, the course\u2019s administrators had to decide whether to revise it substantially away from a writing-focused technical communication course and more toward an introduction to writing studies course. Because we recognized that this shift would no longer serve the students who might be required to take it, nor the students in the rhetoric/technical communication BA, we opted to maintain the course and thus be removed from the general education program. This removal created challenges for enrollment but also presented new opportunities. This presentation will focus on explaining the context and highlighting the challenges and opportunities that will be further explored by the other five speakers on the panel.",
