        "Description/Abstract": "The last couple of decades have seen the rapid advancement of genomic technologies (GT) and their equally rapid adoption into clinical testing. Regardless of specialty, all genetic counselors are unified by the fundamental goal to aid in diagnosing patient's genetic disease underscoring the importance for genetic counselors to maintain an in-depth understanding of GT. The National Society of Genetic Counselors' (NSGC) GT Special Interest Group conducted an online survey of NSGC members to assess current genomic technologies knowledge gaps. A total of 171 individuals from a variety of primary work settings completed the survey sufficiently to be included in the analysis. The majority of respondents received their degree in genetic counseling in more recent years (2000-2015). On average across all technologies, &gt;70% of respondents deemed knowledge of GTs as important for successful job performance, 55% responded that additional job training in GTs is needed to successfully perform job functions, and only 28% responded that graduate training in GTs was good. Overall, the data show that participating genetic counselors perceive that their knowledge of GTs is inadequate while it is a key component of their jobs. These results have implications both for training programs and for continuing education efforts. These data can be used as a starting point for additional research into GT educational needs of genetic counselors.",
