        "Description/Abstract": "BSU Librarians developed a mobile game to make library orientation highly interactive and exciting. \u201cResearch Race\u201d is easy to implement, relies on a mobile environment, and meets the objectives to familiarize and introduce students to library services, including the physical and virtual spaces, and showcases the library\u2019s mobile initiatives. The game has been repurposed to serve students in specific courses, living in the dorms, and has led to collaborations with other faculty and campus departments. UC San Diego Libraries piloted SCVNGR to offer a virtual orientation to the libraries, core services, and orientations. SCVNGR is a social, location-based mobile gaming platform used by enterprises and educational institutions with 1 to 2 million users. Learn from the experiences and data shared by these libraries.",
