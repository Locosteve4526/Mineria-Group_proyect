        "Description/Abstract": "Attitudes and Educational Needs of Nurses Caring for Patients Using Cannabis:\nA Multi-State Investigation\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground:  As the number of states legalizing cannabis use increases both medicinally and recreationally, the likelihood of nurses encountering patients who use this drug also increases.  It is anticipated that many have not received formal education regarding care of the patient who uses cannabis.  This can lead to confusion as nurses try to navigate their ethical and legal obligations in caring for these patients.   \n\nPurpose:  The aim of this study was to examine the attitudes of nurses towards their patients who use cannabis and determine if there is a need in nursing for formal education regarding patient cannabis use.  \n\nMethods:   Participants were solicited via social media to participate in an online 20 question Likert-style Nursing Attitudes Questionnaire.   A convenience sample of 1133 nurses currently practicing across the United States responded to the survey.  \n\nResults:  Results of this study indicate that nursing attitudes toward patient cannabis use are overwhelmingly positive (or nonjudgmental) based on the mean attitudinal score (M = 29.04, SD 7.762).  Additionally, a clear majority of participants, 77.3%, had not received any formal education regarding caring for patients who use cannabis.  Of those who had received formal education only 3.5% received employer offered education and 8.3% received information during nursing school.  The remaining 10.9% received their cannabis education from another source.\nImplications:  With the increase in use and legalization of cannabis across the country, specific education for both student nurses and licensed nurses is warranted to increase knowledge and confidence in caring for this population of patients.\n\nKeywords: cannabis, nurse*, legal*, attitude, education,  marijuana\n",
