        "Description/Abstract": "Objective\n&lt;p&gt;Adolescent alcohol use is a significant public health problem. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of parenting behaviors on adolescent alcohol use based on sex of the adolescent. More specifically, do certain types of parenting behaviors affect male and female adolescents differently.&lt;/p&gt;\nMethods\n&lt;p&gt;A national sample of adolescents aged 12\u201317\u2009years (n\u2009=\u20095,723 adolescents) completed the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to assess past-year (past 12\u2009months) and current (past 30\u2009days) alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;\nResults\n&lt;p&gt;Findings indicated that 19.9% drank alcohol in the past 12\u2009months and 8.6% drank alcohol in the past 30\u2009days. Females were significantly more likely than males to engage in past-year [OR\u2009=\u20091.285 (95% CI\u2009=\u2009(1.128, 1.464)] and current alcohol use [OR\u2009=\u20091.432 (95% CI\u2009=\u2009(1.188, 1.725)]. Adolescents at highest risk for alcohol use had parents who never/seldom helped with homework or limited television viewing, and who fought with them greater than ten times in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;\nConclusions\n&lt;p&gt;Parent involvement is critical to decreasing adolescent alcohol use. Based on these findings, parenting strategies should be incorporated into efforts aimed at preventing youth alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;",
