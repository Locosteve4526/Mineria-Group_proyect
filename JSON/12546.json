        "Description/Abstract": "Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an invasive plant species that contributes to degradation of native sage-steppe ecosystems by increasing fuel loads and the occurrence of wild fires, and by decreasing soil nutrients and moisture. \nAttempts to restore native sage steppe ecosystems frequently have not yielded the desired results.\nManipulative experiments that apply a variety of restoration treatments will enable a better understanding of successful restoration practices.\nImpacts of land management options on soil microbial activity will feedback to native plant reestablishment, as plant-soil feedbacks drive successional trajectories in ecosystems.\nThe USGS (United States Geological Survey) and BLM (Bureau of Land Management) have established a manipulative field experiment that assesses how fuel load reduction treatments (i.e. grazing, herbicide applications and mowing) affect reestablishment of native vegetation.\n",
