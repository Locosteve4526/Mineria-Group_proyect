        "Description/Abstract": "In this paper I examine how job seekers weigh and value their levels of passion for location-dependent, unique non-work natural and cultural amenities (hereafter called Location-Based Passions or LBPs) compared to traditional job rewards (salary, benefits, and prestige) when given a choice. Theoretically, this adds to the debate about whether talent and jobs follow amenities or whether amenities follow jobs and talent by taking a resource-based view of cluster formation and labor dynamics. Empirically, I analyze surveys and experiments conducted on job seekers and find that respondents will tradeoff a definite amount of job-based reward and compensation in proportion to their interest and level of passion in specific Location-Based Passions based on hypothetical job offers.",
