        "Description/Abstract": "This article examines the question of the &quot;polonization&quot; of the Lithuanian nobility. The author refutes the notion that Lithuanian nobles lacked a perception of themselves as a separate nation; instead asserting that they identified the state interests of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with the interests of their own noble house. She employs a dual focus: first analyzing the myth of Roman descent of the Lithuanian nobility and second engaging in content analysis of Radziwi?? family writings. Sources for this study are published articles as well as manuscript sources from the Main Archive of Ancient Documents in Warsaw, Poland.",
