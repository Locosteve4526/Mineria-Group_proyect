        "Description/Abstract": "The focus of this paper is on the use of multimedia representations in the online lesson. The information presented here may be of interest to online instructors with varied levels of experience, yet it is geared more toward those who are new to online teaching. A central feature of this paper is the importance of the lesson plan, which can include identification of how multimedia will be used to create instructional messages for the lesson. The potential exists to increase the quality of instruction through the careful use of static and dynamic multimedia representations. Support for the use of multiple representations is documented in the research literature.",
