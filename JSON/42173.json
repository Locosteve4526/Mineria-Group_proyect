        "Description/Abstract": "Long-billed Curlew populations have declined in many portions of their range and curlews are recognized as a species of concern by many federal, state, and provincial agencies.  Though we can identify many threats in breeding or wintering areas, it\u2019s also critical to know where curlews spend the rest of their annual cycle - including understanding the connectivity of wintering, stopover, and breeding grounds and potential threats throughout the year.  We are examining limitations to breeding success in a variety of grassland and agricultural habitats in the Intermountain West.  In addition, multiple partners are collaborating to describe the migratory connectivity patterns of Long-billed Curlews using satellite telemetry.  We will present movement details, compare results to prior work, consider threats to curlew populations, and discuss future objectives.",
