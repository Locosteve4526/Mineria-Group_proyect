        "Description/Abstract": "\u03b1-Crystallin (\u03b1ABc) is a major protein comprised of \u03b1A-crystallin (\u03b1Ac) and \u03b1B-crystallin (\u03b1Bc) that is found in the human eye lens and works as a molecular chaperone by preventing the aggregation of proteins and providing tolerance to stress. However, with age and cataract formation, the concentration of \u03b1ABc in the eye lens cytoplasm decreases, with a corresponding increase in the membrane-bound \u03b1ABc. This study uses the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-labeling method to investigate the role of cholesterol (Chol) and Chol bilayer domains (CBDs) in the binding of \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc to the Chol/model of human lens-lipid (Chol/MHLL) membranes. The maximum percentage of membrane surface occupied (MMSO) by \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc to Chol/MHLL membranes at a mixing ratio of 0 followed the trends: MMSO (\u03b1Ac) &gt; MMSO (\u03b1Bc) \u2248 MMSO (\u03b1ABc), indicating that a higher amount of \u03b1Ac binds to these membranes compared to \u03b1Bc and \u03b1ABc. However, with an increase in the Chol concentration in the Chol/MHLL membranes, the MMSO by \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc decreases until it is completely diminished at a mixing ratio of 1.5. The K of \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc to Chol/MHLL membranes at a mixing ratio of 0 followed the trend: K (\u03b1Bc) \u2248 K (\u03b1ABc) &gt; K (\u03b1Ac), but it was close to zero with the diminished binding at a Chol/MHLL mixing ratio of 1.5. The mobility near the membrane headgroup regions decreased with \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc binding, and the Chol antagonized the capacity of the \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc to decrease mobility near the headgroup regions. No significant change in membrane order near the headgroup regions was observed, with an increase in \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc concentrations. Our results show that \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc bind differently with Chol/MHLL membranes at mixing ratios of 0 and 0.5, decreasing the mobility and increasing hydrophobicity near the membrane headgroup region, likely forming the hydrophobic barrier for the passage of polar and ionic molecules, including antioxidants (glutathione), creating an oxidative environment inside the lens, leading to the development of cataracts. However, all binding was completely diminished at a mixing ratio of 1.5, indicating that high Chol and CBDs inhibit the binding of \u03b1Ac, \u03b1Bc, and \u03b1ABc to membranes, preventing the formation of hydrophobic barriers and likely protecting against cataract formation.",
