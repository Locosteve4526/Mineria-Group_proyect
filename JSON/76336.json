        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Ninety percent of higher education institutions in the US offer concep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;tually based fitness and wellness (CBFW) courses to improve students\u2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;knowledge and behavior relative to physical and mental health. This&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;literature review investigated CBFW course content, structure, and the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;effectiveness of courses or programs that sought to improve knowledge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;(K), perceived health/fitness (PHF), physical health (PH), and mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;health (MH). Twenty-three articles, published in English between 2003&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;and 2023 with 8059 subjects, met our inclusion criteria. The majority of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;research (65%) focused on courses addressing PHF, K, and PH outcomes;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;some offered physical activity (PA) labs and reported positive physical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;outcomes such as increased PA. The remainder (35%) focused on MH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;strategies and improved MH outcomes (e.g. reduced perceived stress).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the variety of positive benefits reported in these studies, higher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;education institutions should continue to examine ways in which CBFW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;courses can be used to improve physical and mental health.&lt;/span&gt;",
