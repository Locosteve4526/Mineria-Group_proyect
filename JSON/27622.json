        "Description/Abstract": "My old middle school pal Bobby Fisher e-mailed me the other day. I hadn't heard from him in probably thirty years. We were in Webelos and Boy Scouts together; played on the same Little League team (morbidly enough, the Burmeister Funeral Home Bears); and shared many adventures like bike trips, building forts, and playing middle school sports. He'd found a script about a Hardy Boys adventure that we had written and performed in fifth grade as a kind of dress-up book report. Then he'd found my contact information on the Internet and gotten in touch.",
