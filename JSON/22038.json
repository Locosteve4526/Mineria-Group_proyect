        "Description/Abstract": "Prior literature documents economically significant costs in equity trading that result from informational asymmetry. Asymmetries lead to adverse selection costs being reflected in the price patterns and trading behavior of market participants in the secondary markets for equity. Mechanisms which reduce asymmetries then reduce the costs of transacting by ameliorating the costs to doing so. In this study, we use a sample of credit rating initiations, the first-time a firm obtains a long-term issuer rating from Standard and Poor\u2019s, to examine the effects that becoming rated has on secondary market equity liquidity. We find that the firms who decide to become rated see an improvement in secondary market liquidity regardless of the specific measure we use to measure liquidity. Measures of changes in Amihud (2002) liquidity and volume show an improvement over a match set of control firms of 10.82% and 7.4% in the period 90-days before the rating to 90-days after. Ask-bid spread, the costs to transacting, falls by 3.56% more for newly-rated firms than for control firms. Finally, we show how managers take advantage of the increased liquidity through the issuance of seasoned equity offerings. Relative to the control group, newly-rated firms are more likely to issue and suffer less in terms of valuation for doing so. Role: Principal",
