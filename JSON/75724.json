        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;This exploratory study investigates educators\u2019 attitudes towards and perspectives on the impacts of Generative AI (GenAI). While there is some research focused on understanding the student perspective on GenAI, less is known about the instructor perspective \u2013 particularly in regard to programming education and the implementation of these new tools. We propose using a qualitative survey to explore educators\u2019 uses, concerns, and perceived impacts of GenAI; the survey will also include measures to capture attitudes and mindfulness to determine how these factors may relate to adoption decisions. The results of this study may enable us to identify opportunities and challenges with the adoption and implementation of GenAI in programming education, leading to improved integration with coursework and learning outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;",
