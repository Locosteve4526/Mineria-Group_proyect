        "Description/Abstract": "Aptamers with fluorogenic ligands are emerging as useful tools to quantify and track RNA molecules. The RNA Mango family of aptamers have a useful combination of tight ligand binding, bright fluorescence, and small size. However, the simple structure of these aptamers, with a single base-paired stem capped by a G-quadruplex, can limit the sequence and structural modifications needed for many use-inspired designs. Here we report new structural variants of RNA Mango that have two base-paired stems attached to the quadruplex. Fluorescence saturation analysis of one of the double-stemmed constructs showed a maximum fluorescence that is \u223c75% brighter than the original single-stemmed Mango I. A small number of mutations to nucleotides in the tetraloop-like linker of the second stem were subsequently analyzed. The effect of these mutations on the affinity and fluorescence suggested that the nucleobases of the second linker do not directly interact with the fluorogenic ligand (TO1-biotin), but may instead induce higher fluorescence by indirectly altering the ligand properties in the bound state. The effects of the mutations in this second tetraloop-like linker indicate the potential of this second stem for rational design and reselection experiments. Additionally, we demonstrated that a bimolecular mango designed by splitting the double-stemmed Mango can function when two RNA molecules are cotranscribed from different DNA templates in a single in vitro transcription. This bimolecular Mango has potential application in detecting RNA-RNA interactions. Together, these constructs expand the designability of the Mango aptamers to facilitate future applications of RNA imaging.",
