        "Description/Abstract": "The ability to quantify soil-atmosphere water and energy exchange is  important in understanding agricultural and natural ecosystems, as well  as the earth's climate. We developed a one-dimensional vertical model  that calculates solar radiation, canopy energy balance, surface energy  balance, snowpack dynamics, soil water flow, and snow\u2013soil\u2013bedrock heat  exchange, including soil water freezing. The processes are loosely  coupled (solved sequentially) to limit the computational burden. The  model was applied to describe water and energy dynamics for a  northeast-facing mountain slope in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed  near Boise, ID. Calibration was achieved by optimizing the saturated  soil hydraulic conductivity. Validation results showed that the model  can successfully calculate seasonal dynamics in snow height, soil water  content, and soil temperature. Both the calibration and validation years  confirmed earlier results that evapotranspiration on the  northeast-facing slope consumes approximately 60% of yearly  precipitation, while deep percolation from the soil profile constitutes  about 40% of yearly precipitation.",
