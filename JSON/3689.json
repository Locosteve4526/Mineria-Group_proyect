        "Description/Abstract": "Background\n\nTumor cell lines that can be tracked in vivo during tumorigenesis and metastasis provide vital tools for studying the specific cellular mechanisms that mediate these processes as well as investigating therapeutic targets to inhibit them. The goal of this study was to engineer imageable mouse mammary tumor cell lines with discrete propensities to metastasize to bone in vivo. Two novel luciferase expressing cell lines were developed and characterized for use in the study of breast cancer metastasis to bone in a syngeneic mouse model.\n\nResults \n\nThe 4T1.2 luc3 and 66c14 luc2 cell lines were shown to have high levels of bioluminescence intensity in vitro and in vivo after orthotopic injection into mouse mammary fat pads. The 4T1.2 luc3 cell line was found to closely model the sites of metastases seen in human patients including lung, liver, and bone. Specifically, 4T1.2 luc3 cells demonstrated a high incidence of metastasis to spine, with an ex-vivo BLI intensity three orders of magnitude above the commercially available 4T1 luc2 cells. 66c14 luc2 cells also demonstrated metastasis to spine, which was lower than that of 4T1.2 luc3 cells but higher than 4T1 luc2 cells, in addition to previously unreported metastases in the liver. High osteolytic activity of the 4T1.2 luc3 cells in vivo in the bone microenvironment was also detected.\n\nConclusions \n\nThe engineered 4T1.2 luc3 and 66c14 luc2 cell lines described in this study are valuable tools for studying the cellular events moderating the metastasis of breast tumor cells to bone.\n\n",
