        "Description/Abstract": "Focus, also known as specialization, has been hypothesized to reduce the cost of care while simultaneously improving outcomes of patients. While focused (specialized) hospitals range from standalone specialty hospitals to hospitals choosing to emphasize on certain condition(s), authors have noted that there are limitations in the conceptualization and measurement to evaluate the concept of \u201cfocus as an emphasis\u201d within a hospital. Given the importance of gaining economies of scale to implement a focus strategy, the size of a hospital and the basis of patients it serves has implications for the effectiveness of the strategy. This study attempts tolook at the implications of hospital size to assess the hospital\u2019s ability to reduce costs and address patient needs while also evaluating the impacts of a \u201cfocus as an emphasis\u201d strategy.",
