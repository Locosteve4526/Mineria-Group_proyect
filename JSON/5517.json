        "Description/Abstract": "X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) have been measured at the chloride K-edge for a series of complexes containing chloride ligands bound to open shell d{sup 9} copper ions in order to probe ligand-metal bonding. The intensity of the pre-edge feature in these spectra reflects the covalency in the half-occupied d{sub x}{sup 2-}{sub y}{sup 2-} derived molecular orbital (HOMO) of the complex. The energy of the pre-edge feature as well as the energy of the rising absorption edge provides quantitative information about the covalency of the ligand-metal interaction, the charge donated by the chloride, and the energy of the copper d-manifold. The results demonstrate that ligand K-edge XAS features can be used to obtain information about ligand-metal bonding. The results also identify the chemical basis for trends in the XAS data for the following complexes: D{sub 4h} CuCl{sub 4}{sup 2-}, D{sub 2d} CuCl{sub 4}{sup 2-}, planar trans-CuCl{sub 2-} (pdmp){sub 2} (pdmp = N-phenyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazole), square pyramidal CuCl{sub 5}{sup 3-}, the planar dimer KCuCl{sub 3}, the distorted tetrahedral dimer (Ph{sub 4}P)CuCl{sub 3}, and two dimers with mixed ligation, one containing a bridging chloride, and the other, containing terminally bound chloride. Several of these results are supported by independent spectral data or by basic ligand field concepts. A geometric distortion from square planar to distorted tetrahedral results in a decrease in the chloride-copper HOMO covalency but an increase in the total charge donation by the chlorides. While the geometry can maximize the overlap for a highly covalent HOMO, this does not necessarily reflect the overall charge donation.",
