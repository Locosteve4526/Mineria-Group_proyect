        "Description/Abstract": "As an area of practice, study, and research, education is often conceptualized as a loose collection of phenomena and concerns to be investigated and theorized by methods and disciplines external to it. Could education be defined constitutively as a domain and theorized in a way that is itself educational? This paper, which is part of the special issue on \u201cTheoretical Research in Education,\u201d considers a common, general way of accomplishing this. It follows the example of Hannah Arendt, who, in her 1958 \u2018The Crisis in Education,\u2019 takes \u201cthe relation between grown-ups and children in general\u201d as her starting initial premise. She develops this claim variously, but at one point compares a child\u2019s \u201cprocess of becoming\u201d to that of a kitten\u2014with the first being a question of historicity and natality, and the second, of biology. John Dewey\u2019s \u2018Democracy and Education,\u2019 and two texts central to German-language canon\u2014Siegfried Bernfeld\u2019s 1925 \u2018Sisyphus, or the Limits of Education,\u2019 and F.D.E. Schleiermacher\u2019s 1826 \u2018Outlines of the Art of Education\u2019\u2014also offer analogous intergenerational definitions and also develop them in a broadly speculative manner. Framing these as ways of engaging in theoretical research. These ways of theorizing, this paper concludes that investigations of this kind, allow for a constitutive understanding of education, one established from an educational perspective, and one suited specifically to the way that education, as Schleiermacher himself noted, is \u201cnot self-contained, and always presupposes something that it can\u2019t decide on its own.\u201d",
