        "Description/Abstract": "PURPOSE: Healthy Habits, Healthy U (HHHU) is a two-day school-based primary prevention cancer\r\neducation program that uses interactive classroom presentations designed to help students learn how to\r\nreduce their cancer risks. HHHU is a collaboration between a local cancer hospital, school district and\r\nuniversity. HHHU incorporates real cancerous and non-cancerous specimens to help students see\r\ncancer\u2019s impact on the body. The purpose of this formative evaluation was to revise the program based\r\non feedback from the students, teachers, facilitators and research assistants. METHODS: Two studies,\r\nfall and spring, were conducted to assess the efficacy of the HHHU junior high cancer prevention\r\nprogram. Eight hundred thirteen students participated in Study 1 and eight hundred twenty participated in\r\nStudy 2. RESULTS: The results indicated that students learned how lifestyle choices affect the body,\r\nwhat cancer is and how it develops. Students could identify three of their unhealthy habits that might\r\nincrease their risk for cancer as well as how they could make changes to these unhealthy habits in the\r\nnext 30 days to decrease their risk of cancer. Feedback from students, teachers and the HHHU team was\r\nused to make program improvements for Study 2. CONCLUSIONS: The results of Study 1 and Study 2\r\nsuggest that students\u2019 knowledge of cancer, how cancer develops, and ways everyday lifestyle choices\r\naffect the risk of developing cancer have improved following program implementation. Incorporating\r\nparticipant feedback improved program delivery and student worksheets. RECOMMENDATIONS: Ask\r\nstudents to create a plan to improve an unhealthy habit and conduct a follow-up with students at the end\r\nof the semester. Continue to refine the program and expand to additional urban and rural schools. Add an\r\nelementary school version of the program.",
