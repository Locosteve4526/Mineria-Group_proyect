        "Description/Abstract": "To speak of a general Canadian school of media theory is to use a specifically German label, one that can be traced to Kittler\u2019s Optical Media: Berlin Lectures 1999, where he inaccurately attributes the term to Arthur Kroker\u2019s Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant. \u2026A Canadian school of media theory and Toronto school of communication both refer to the same general intellectual output, but differences in each name\u201d and frames this output is significant. To speak of the \u201cToronto school\u201d is to see this work as a local approach to communication, suggesting that it was a faction within the larger, contemporaneous and mainly empirical study of communication. To speak of a \u201cCanadian school\u201d suggests something much more substantial, namely the founding, as Dieter Mersch describes, of a \u201cgeneral theory of media\u201d or of the original introduction of \u201cthe term \u2018media\u2019 as it is used in cultural theory today.\u201d",
