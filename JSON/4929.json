        "Description/Abstract": "The use of improved recovery techniques during the past two decades has resulted in the more consistent recovery of fish remains from archaeological sites. The evidence to date suggests that fishing activity spans several millennia though it appears it may have been relatively more common during the past fifteen hundred years. Archaeological evidence suggests that salmon, trout and other species were utilized. This paper briefly reviews the status and interpretations of the archaeological data base and describes the results of recent osteological analyses of fish remains from three sites (10-EL-22, 10- EL-1367 and 1O-EL-392) in southwestern Idaho.",
