        "Description/Abstract": "The Narrative TV Initiative is an intensive four-semester creative collaboration between students and faculty in the development, writing, production, and distribution of an original serial TV narrative. \n\nI spearheaded the initiative, finding partners in other departments and disciplines -- including Theatre, Creative Writing, and Music -- raising funds, and implementing the four-semester course rollout. We completed the first NTVI show, &quot;And Beyond,&quot; in Fall 2017. The show will premiere at the Egyptian Theatre in downtown Boise on March 13, 2018. \n\nThe show was selected to screen at 72nd University Film and Video Association Conference, July 2018, at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico. \n\nIn addition to serving as the executive producer for the show, I co-directed the pilot episode with undergraduate Theatre and Media Production student, Josh Schneider.
