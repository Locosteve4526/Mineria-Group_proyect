        "Description/Abstract": "360-degree video (or 360\u00b0 video) is recorded in an omnidirectional form so that viewers can look in any direction while the video plays. Interest in the application of 360\u00b0 video has been emerging along with the advancement of lower cost technologies and increase in online video content. Little is known about trends in the emerging research for 360\u00b0 video. A scoping review was conducted through a systematic process to identify trends in peer-reviewed research journal articles. A sample of 12 articles were identified as meeting the research criteria. Findings illuminate the extent and nature of research on educational 360\u00b0 video along with the benefits and drawbacks for learning. The results show how 360\u00b0 video was used in nine different content areas to promote immersive learning through virtual reality. Learners indicated enjoyment with the experience of learning with 360\u00b0 VR video, but the results were mixed regarding the impact on learning.\n",
