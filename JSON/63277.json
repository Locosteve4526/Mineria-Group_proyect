        "Description/Abstract": "Theory and empirical research suggest organizational climate for evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation may be an important and malleable target to improve clinician use of EBPs in healthcare; however, this work has been criticized for overreliance on self-report measures of implementation outcomes and cross-sectional designs. This study combines data from two studies spanning 7 years to test the hypothesis that higher levels of organizational EBP implementation climate prospectively predicts improved clinician adherence to an EBP, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as rated by expert observers.",
