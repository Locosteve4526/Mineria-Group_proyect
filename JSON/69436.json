        "Description/Abstract": "This report presents the Gateway Scholars Program, an NSF-S-STEM supported program that recruited academically talented undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need. The objectives of our program included establishing a mentored cohort program, implementing enhanced risk-based advising, integrating evidence-based instructional practices in the curriculum, engaging students in co-curricular experiences, and generating new knowledge about the effect of activities on retention, student success, and degree attainment. Knowledge about broadening participation and effectiveness of evidence-based practices in STEM curricular and co-curricular activities and systems developed through this program have the potential to impact all STEM departments.",
