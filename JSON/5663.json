        "Description/Abstract": "Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) uses specially designed activities and cooperative learning to teach content and to \nactively engage students in inquiry, analytical thinking and teamwork. It has been used extensively in Chemistry education, but the use of POGIL is not well documented in other physical and biological sciences. This is a descriptive account of the initial implementation of POGIL in a university biomechanics course and includes the benefits,  challenges and recommendations for teachers interested in using this effective instructional strategy.",
