        "Description/Abstract": "Heidegger asserts that Stimmungen, sustained moods or attunements, are the fundamental mode or medium of our being and being\u2010together. In this sense Stimmungen can be said to fundamentally atmospheric. It is a shared mood or atmosphere that determines the way that the world is disclosed to us\u2014meaning that atmospheres possess a deeply epistemic, hermeneutic dimension. If every atmosphere brings with it a shared interpretation of the world, then one needs to share or participate in this atmosphere in order to share in knowledge or learning. Only when a Stimmung suitable to such disclosure has been cultivated or encountered will the sought\u2010after knowledge \u201cdawn\u201d on one, as Bollnow puts it (2017, p. 1414; 1956, p. 57). It goes without saying that Bollnow\u2019s statement has significant implications for pedagogy, for teaching and learning as fundamentally atmospheric experiences, and these are explored in this paper. But I begin by discussing the elusive epistemology of the atmospheric itself\u2014what we are able to know about how we know, what access we have to the atmospheric, to the mode of our being and knowing. Then, through an illustrative video example, I go on to discuss what can be seen to make an atmosphere, a shared way of knowing, specifically pedagogical.",
