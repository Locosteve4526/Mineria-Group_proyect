        "Description/Abstract": "In response to the dynamically changing workplace environment for learning and development (L&amp;D) professionals, there is a pressing need to engage in lifelong learning and support learning opportunities that inspire inclusive, responsible, and sustainable behavior within the modern workforce. The challenge is encouraging a thirst for learning within individuals and teams that develops greater self-awareness and empowers individuals to challenge the status quo. Accordingly, our experience as graduate students and L&amp;D professionals inspired this research into ways metacognitive strategies can help exponentially improve learning outcomes. After reviewing the literature, the team found the topic appears to have received very little attention. This inspired our call to action. To better understand the topic, we initiated a collaborative autoethnographic analysis during the summer of 2021. The team interviewed each other to triangulate qualitative data and identify themes. This systematic approach helped us develop a conceptual framework for the Metacognitive Learning and Growth (MLG) model that emphasizes metacognition, mindset, and external factors such as organizational safety on personal growth. Our analysis of metacognitive experiences suggests L&amp;D professionals can use the five-step MLG model to develop requisite skills that transform learning barriers into opportunities for investigation and professional growth. This can be a recursive model applicable at individual or group level and contributes to self-realization and enhancement of the learning experience. As learners become more aware of how their thought processes impact their learning ability, they become more knowledgeable and better positioned to transfer what they learn into their workplace behavior.",
