        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, salmon and steelhead are a significant ecological, social, and economic resource. Many of these species are listed as endangered or threatened on the U.S. Endangered Species List. Efforts to restore their populations have largely failed. Recent efforts have called to renew efforts, including dam removal. Public support for these programs is imperative. There are a range of factors, including geography, that can influence public support. This study aims to assess the self-identified rural and urban distinctions of support for salmon recovery efforts. In October 2022, 750 Idaho residents completed an electronic survey, with 47% identifying a \u201crural\u201d resident. Of the nine factors listed as a risk to salmon, both groups identified salmon hatcheries as the greatest risk to salmon, and urban development as the lowest risk. Both groups support or greatly support dam removal. These findings can assist policy makers and fish and wildlife managers with respect to recognizing the preferences of the public in different geographies of residence.&lt;/p&gt;",
