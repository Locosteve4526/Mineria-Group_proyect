        "Description/Abstract": "As libraries struggle to recruit and retain staff members from underrepresented ethnic and cultural groups, alternative strategies must be advanced to more competently assess and meet the needs of the increasingly diverse American population in all aspects of librarianship. Training in cross cultural competency for all library staff may help libraries become more adept at serving their multiethnic patrons.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will examine concepts in cross cultural awareness and how they can apply to libraries. Through cross cultural training we may gain the knowledge, understanding, attitudes and skills to overcome a variety of biases and assumptions. Overcoming these obstacles could engender broader vision of the value and usability of materials, a reassessment of programming and outreach, and a renewed commitment to public service with an informed sensitivity to the varied populations served.",
