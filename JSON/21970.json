        "Description/Abstract": "Senator Barry Goldwater and his partisans held the news media partially responsible for his landslide loss to President Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and historical accounts of the campaign have reinforced the narrative of an unfair and biased press. Despite the significance attributed to the media, no analysis of coverage across the entire campaign exists. This study analyzed the work of three prominent columnists \u2013 Walter Lippmann, Joseph Alsop, and James Reston \u2013 who represented the \u201cEstablishment\u201d media targeted for criticism. The study concluded that although none of these columnists supported Goldwater, their work was consistent with the professional norms under which they operated. At times, however, they fell short of their professional obligations, which may have fed a politically motivated narrative that formed about coverage of Goldwater and nourished the idea of a liberal media bias that conservative publications developed beginning in the 1950s.",
