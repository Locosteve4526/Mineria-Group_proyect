        "Description/Abstract": "The evolution of high-crowned cheek teeth (hypsodonty) in herbivorous mammals during the late Cenozoic is classically regarded as an adaptive response to the near-global spread of grass-dominated habitats. In turn, precocious hypsodonty in middle Eocene (~38 million years ago [Ma]) faunas from Patagonia, South America, is thought to signal Earth\u2019s first grasslands, 20 million years earlier than elsewhere. Using a high-resolution, 43-18 Ma record of plant silica (phytoliths) from Patagonia, we show that although open-habitat grasses existed in southern South America since the middle Eocene (~40 Ma), they were minor floral components in overall forested habitats between 43 and 18 Ma. Thus, distinctly different, continent-specific environmental conditions (arid grasslands vs. ash-laden forests) triggered convergent cheek tooth evolution in Cenozoic herbivores. The evolution of hypsodonty is an important example where the present is an insufficient key to the past, and contextual information from fossils is vital for understanding processes of adaptation.",
