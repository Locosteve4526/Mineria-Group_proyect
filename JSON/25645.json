        "Description/Abstract": "Landrum/Davis provides strategies for success that will allow students to achieve their career goals, whatever they may be. The authors provide fundamental tips and advice that can be useful to all students, but especially useful for psychology majors.\nThe approach of this book is applied\u2014to provide students with practical, timely, up-to-date information. This text standardizes and catalogs much of the practical advice that professors often give to students\u2014providing tips on how to do well in all classes, how to find research ideas, and how to write papers in general APA format. Also, the book contains up-to-date career information that faculty might not normally have at their fingertips, including the latest salary figures for a number of psychology-related jobs and occupations. Other benefits include the coverage of ethics for undergraduate students, sections on self-reflection, and an overview of disciplines related to psychology.",
