        "Description/Abstract": "My research partner, Dr. Cheryl Maddalena, and I are investigating how expressive writing techniques influence measures of physical and emotional health. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of writing interventions targeted to participants\u2019 emotional processing level (EP) compared to a control writing condition. Undergraduates (N=64) were divided into high-EP and low-EP groups, then randomly assigned to complete three 20 minute writing interventions (\u201cemotional disclosure\u201d for high-EP, \u201cbest possible self\u201d for low-EP) or control writing assignments. At four weeks post-intervention, \u201cbest possible self\u201d and \u201cemotional disclosure\u201d conditions resulted in decreased need-based medical visits (Prob &gt; F = 0.0127) and health symptoms (Prob &gt; F = 0.0397) compared to controls. This pilot study indicates that using EP level to target writing interventions to preferred emotional processing style is a viable alternative to indiscriminant application of emotional disclosure interventions.\nPartners:  Dr. Cheryl Maddalena\nDescription of Partner:  Research partners\nRole:  Co-Principal",
