        "Description/Abstract": "Plants use electrochemical components and devices that they inherit by nature to establish intercellular, intracellular, and extracellular communication. They communicate by sending electrical signals through the different types of electrical networks in response to environmental stresses and make decisions by cell computing system like neuromorphic system. To control their decision-making process, we can use electrostimulation process instead of environmental stress. In this work, we are going to generate the specific action potential by using a memristor-based circuit to control the movement of the Mimosa pudica plant.\r\n",
