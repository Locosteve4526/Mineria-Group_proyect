        "Description/Abstract": "In goals of care conversations and through the care trajectory, to avoid insensitive or discriminatory care, it is vital clinicians recognize lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer+ patients' values and wishes. In clinical settings, implicit bias operating within unconscious awareness may challenge the commitment to equitable care, negatively affecting patient outcomes. In this composite case, during a conversation with a social worker/nurse team, a cisgender woman repeatedly expressed her wishes for her female partner to be her decision maker instead of her biological family. The conversation stalled during the patient's attempts to identify her partner as her most valued and trusted person. Interviewer follow-up responses based on motivational interviewing techniques, which do not include strategies for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer+ interactions, inaccurately reflected the patient's needs. Two ethical issues emerged, (1) autonomy and (2) beneficence. Clinicians should approach all patients using nongendered language, and allow patients to self-identify and decide which people are in their support system. Lack of inclusivity training has significant potential to affect the patient experience and decrease clinician/patient trust. Clinicians should not assume the decision maker is a cisgender, heterosexual partner or a biological family member. When patients speak about their partners, it is imperative clinicians use the patient's language and not avoid or redirect responses.",
