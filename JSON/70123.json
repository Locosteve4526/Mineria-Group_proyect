        "Description/Abstract": "Human actions, both legal and illegal, affect wildlife in many ways. Inaccurate&lt;br&gt;diagnosis of cause of death undermines law enforcement, management, threat&lt;br&gt;assessment, and mitigation. We found 410 dead birds collected along 196 km of&lt;br&gt;power lines in four western USA states during 2019\u20132022. We necropsied these&lt;br&gt;carcasses to test conventional wisdom suggesting that electrocution is the leading cause of death of birds at electrical infrastructure. Of 175 birds with a&lt;br&gt;known cause of death, 66% died from gunshot. Both raptors and corvids&lt;br&gt;were more likely to die from gunshot than from other causes, along both transmission and distribution lines. Past mitigation to reduce avian deaths along&lt;br&gt;power lines has focused almost exclusively on reducing electrocutions or collisions. Our work suggests that, although electrocution and collision remain&lt;br&gt;important, addressing illegal shooting now may have greater relevance for&lt;br&gt;avian conservation.",
