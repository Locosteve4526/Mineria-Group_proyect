        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virtual healthcare technologies are becoming increasingly acceptable and available to patients and providers to deliver care. Although common in practice settings, many nursing schools have not integrated virtual care concepts into the curriculum. One reason may be because faculty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;are not prepared to teach these concepts. The purpose of this study was to assess the virtual healthcare learning needs of faculty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;An exploratory, descriptive study design was used to evaluate faculty receptiveness and readiness to teach virtual nursing care concepts. Thirty-seven full time faculty members were asked to complete an anonymous survey consisting of demographic, open-ended, and Likert scale items based on the technology acceptance model, the Virtual Clinical Practicum Attitude Survey, and the Evidence-Based Practice Beliefs scale. Quantitative data was evaluated using descriptive statistics and qualitative data with a thematic analysis process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0Twenty-two\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;faculties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0completed a survey regarding their beliefs about virtual healthcare technologies. Most respondents believe that virtual care improves access for patients and that students should have training in these technologies. However, few had used virtual technology in their own clinical practices and wanted further education about them. Faculty was receptive to integrating virtual care into the curriculum and reported their learning needs could be met through didactic content and simulation activities with faculty as learners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;An opportunity exists to prepare faculty to teach virtual healthcare concepts. Addressing faculty learning needs could aid in the successful integration of virtual healthcare concepts into the curriculum, thus, better preparing students to deliver virtual care to their future patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keywords:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;irtual healthcare, telehealth, nursing education, faculty development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
