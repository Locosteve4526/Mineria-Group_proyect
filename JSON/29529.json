        "Description/Abstract": "Do you ever get the feeling a service your library offers could be improved? Do you notice users struggle with the same challenges over and over? You might not need more funding to fix it, just a change in perspective. In this workshop you will acquire real skills and design a persona for your library. Personas are fictional people, but based on data and observations. Using personas will help you make user centered decisions. This workshop will walk participants through the process of creating personas they can apply to specific services their library offers.",
