        "Description/Abstract": "In Poetry and Its Others Jahan Ramazani compares poetry to other forms of language-use, including the  law, news, prayer, and song, to show how poetry synthesizes other discourses but significantly differs from them.  Ramazani (the author of A Transnational Poetics and Poetry of Mourning and editor of the Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry) adapts Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s intertextual model of the novel to explore how poetry interacts with non-poetic discourses, drawing on their varied resources but also competing with them for longevity and depth.  For example, he draws on Auden\u2019s definition of poetry as \u201cmemorable speech\u201d to mark it off from the ephemerality of news reports, but he also explores how poetry by Carribean and other writers represents valuable information about the world\u2014thereby living up to Pound\u2019s definition of literature as \u201cnews that stays news.\u201d  Similarly, he shows how poetry, like law, commits itself to the particulars of specific cases.  But where law derives its power from the state, poetry achieves its authority by using linguistic and figurative resources to enliven the imagination and defend human dignity.  Ramazani justifies his approach through  illuminating analyses of a diverse set of poems. Recommended.",
