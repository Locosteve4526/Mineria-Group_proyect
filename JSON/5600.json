A situated account of her work as a tenure-track faculty  member in a university English department is provided. Suggestions that  writing program administrators might consider in developing or modifying  programs for the linguistically diverse students are offered. Issues  regarding the creation of additional administrative positions to address  second language writing are raised.",
