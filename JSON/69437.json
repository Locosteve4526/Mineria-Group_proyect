        "Description/Abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a highly effective chemotherapeutic used to treat many adult and pediatric cancers. However, its use is limited due to a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can lead to lethal cardiomyopathy. In contrast to the extensive research efforts on toxic effects of DOX in cardiomyocytes, its effects and mechanisms on cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis and remodeling are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the potential effects of DOX on cardiac ECM to further our mechanistic understanding of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",
