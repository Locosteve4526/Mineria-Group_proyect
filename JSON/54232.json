        "Description/Abstract": "Entomological surveillance has been a component of an ongoing, multi-year study\nof malaria transmission and its control in a high transmission area of NE Uganda.\nWe report on seasonal and locational trends among the two primary malarial\nvectors taken from 90 sentinel huts in three connected subcounties of the\nKatakwi district. As part of the study, two of three subcounties receive indoor\nresidual spraying with pirimiphos methyl, alone or in combination with a mass\ndrug administration campaign of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Mosquitoes in\nthese districts, with and without these interventions, are collected for a single\nnight at monthly intervals with CDC light traps for nearly three years. Temporal\ntrends and spatial mapping for these surveillance hut collections, and those\nsubcounty-wide, are reported. A biannual seasonal trend for sequential,\ncoordinated emergence of members of the A. gambiae s. l. complex and A.\nfunestus is observed. This is an interspecific interaction, with two sequentially\nindependent, annual vector density peaks found, each dominated by a single\nspecies. A spatially complex picture of the mosquito densities is also observed\nthough both species appear to largely share the same locales. The intervention impacts of IRS are very apparent on the mosquito densities, with percentage reductions generally around 70-80% compared to the neighboring regions without vector control. These results suggest that in Katakwi the vector control efforts have been effective, should be seasonally performed, and in such a high transmission environment may not benefit from focal targeting.",
