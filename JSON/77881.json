Through interacting with GenAI, PSTs improve their ability to prompt for tailored feedback and iteratively assess their own work. The findings highlight best practices for prioritizing essential teaching tasks while utilizing AI tools that are reshaping the future of educational technology. This research also offers insights into GenAI\u2019s role in supporting effective lesson planning and fostering professional growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
