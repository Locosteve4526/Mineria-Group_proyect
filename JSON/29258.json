        "Description/Abstract": "Being able to monitor the clinical proficiencies of students who are preparing to enter a healthcare profession is important in assuring that each student will be able to carry out their future professional functions successfully. A new smart-phone application (app) was tested to determine if the proficiency levels of nursing students carrying out a standardized seasonal influenza immunization protocol could be documented accurately. The student performance was evaluated by four instructors independently where each instructor used a standardized competency check-list. The study showed that the remote evaluation of clinical nursing student proficiencies could be accomplished quickly and accurately using the new smart-phone application.",
