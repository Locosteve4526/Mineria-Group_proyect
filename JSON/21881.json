        "Description/Abstract": " A two-day workshop focusing on all aspects of volcano acoustics will be held in conjunction with the 2013 IAVCEI Scientific Assembly. The workshop will take place on the active Sakurajima Volcano and will provide unique field opportunities to service infrasound sensors on an erupting volcano and then analyze recorded data with a group of experts. Discussion of current topics in volcano acoustics and outreach to local communities will also occur. Students are particularly encouraged to attend. Participants will have access to data collected during the workshop.\nPartners:  David Fee (University of Alaska Fairbanks), Mie Ichihara (University of Tokyo), and Akihiko Yokoo (Kyoto University)\nDescription of Partner:  Volcanology community will benefit from hands-on instruction in volcano acoustics.  This workshop is associated with the quadrennial IAVCEI general assembly meeting in Kagoshima, Japan.\nRole:  Co-Principal",
