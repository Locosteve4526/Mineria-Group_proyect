        "Description/Abstract": "This article describes the use of the Baccalaureate Educational Assessment Project (BEAP) to assist programs and faculty in meeting the challenging tasks of assessing program outcomes. The BEAP is a package of evaluation instruments that help social work programs assess student outcomes, as required by Council on Social Work Education accreditation standards. The article discusses the evolution of the BEAP model and considers its relevance in helping social work programs assess student outcomes. An overview of some of the data available to programs is provided along with a description of how these may be used for program assessment. The article concludes by describing how programs can become involved in using the BEAP and discussing future considerations.",
