        "Description/Abstract": "Nutritional analysis of camas was conducted on samples from three southern Idaho localities. Nutritional content suggests substantially lower protein values than those reported by Schrimsher (1967) but greater than reported by Yanovsky and Kingsbury (1938). Caloric value was high for all samples. Analysis of sediments from the sample localities supports Statham's (1982) hypothesis that poor soil drainage, specifically high clay fraction, may impede colonization. The latter may be a factor in the aboriginal use of camas fields.",
