This body of work is a collaborative series of handwoven shrouds by Lily and site-specific photography by Carrie Quinney. The Great Basin Murders are a loose grouping of homicides spanning the 1970\u2019s to 1990\u2019s in which women were found killed and dumped in remote areas, often along the region\u2019s highways. Most of these cases are unsolved today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lee will speak in the first hour and then join guests for an informal in-gallery conversation&lt;/p&gt;",
