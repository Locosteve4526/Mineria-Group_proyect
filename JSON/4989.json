        "Description/Abstract": "College academic success and retention have traditionally been predicted using demographic and academic variables. This study investigated the influence of student health on GPA and intent to drop out of college. A longitudinal survey of 242 freshmen revealed that emotional and social factors (e.g., stress, living in the dorm, being in a study group) predicted second semester GPA and intentions to drop out (e.g., perfectionism, fatigue). Implications for intervention strategies are discussed.",
