        "Description/Abstract": "Population health improvements can be achieved through work made possible by government spending on health care, public health, and social services. The extent to which spending allocations across these sectors is synergistic with or trade-off against one another is unknown. Achieving a balanced portfolio with multi-sector contributions is key to improving health outcomes. This study tested competing hypotheses regarding achievement of balanced multi-sector resources for health. County-level U.S. Census Bureau data on all local governmental spending measured each county's average per capita local government spending for public hospitals, public health, social services, and education. American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey data on hospital community health service provision were used to calculate an index of hospital community service provision aggregated to county level by year. County Health Rankings data measured each county's health outcomes and health factors. Longitudinal mixed-effects regression models (n = 1877 counties) predicted changes in spending for each government spending category based on two sets of predictors ( vs ) from current and prior year. Models account for average spending in each category and county-, state-, and time-trends. Models showed that spending increases in each of the four spending categories examined (public hospitals, public health, social services, and education) were not associated with changes in spending across other categories in current or prior years. For all categories, an increase from baseline spending levels in Year 1 was always significantly associated with an increase from baseline spending level in that same category in Year 2 (ie, spending stayed above baseline in Year 2). Multi-sector initiatives to health outcomes require funding across sectors, yet there was little evidence to suggest that communities that invest in public hospitals, public health, or other social services see commensurate increases in other areas. Underlying funding decisions may reflect strategic decisions within a community to scale up single sectors, constrained resources for multi-sector scale up, or a host of additional factors not measured here.",
