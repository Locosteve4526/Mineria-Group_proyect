        "Description/Abstract": "There is significant overlap in the distribution of the 9 vulture species found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. Niche-partitioning and ecological interactions among these species have long been a point of interest for researchers studying these important birds. Many studies have focused on observations in the field, but movement data provide us with another means of quantifying behavioral differences among African vultures. We focused on four trajectory characteristics to explore differences in movement ecology of White-headed Vulture (&lt;em&gt;Trigonoceps occipitalis&lt;/em&gt;) and White-backed Vulture (&lt;em&gt;Gyps africanus&lt;/em&gt;) in and around Gorongosa National Park in central Mozambique. We found that White-headed Vultures flew at lower altitudes and slower speeds, and initiated short-distance flight earlier in the day than did White-backed Vultures. White-headed Vultures were also more active throughout the day than White-backed Vultures, e.g., the proportion of locations coded as active vs. stationary was slightly higher for White-headed Vultures than White-backed Vultures during all daylight hours. These findings suggest White-headed Vulture flight requires less intense thermal uplift than does that of White-backed Vultures. They also support the hypothesis that the White-headed Vulture is a more efficient searcher and thus a pioneer in the African avian scavenger guild.",
