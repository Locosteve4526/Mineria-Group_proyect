        "Description/Abstract": "Kneeling is required during daily living for many patients after total knee replacement (TKR), yet many patients have reported that they cannot kneel due to pain, or avoid kneeling due to discomfort, which critically impacts quality of life and perceived success of the TKR procedure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of component design on patellofemoral (PF) mechanics during a kneeling activity. A computational model to predict natural and implanted PF kinematics and bone strains after kneeling was developed and kinematics were validated with experimental cadaveric studies. PF joint kinematics and patellar bone strains were compared for implants with dome, medialized dome, and anatomic components. Due to the less conforming nature of the designs, change in sagittal plane tilt as a result of kneeling at 90\u00b0 knee flexion was approximately twice as large for the medialized-dome and dome implants as the natural case or anatomic implant, which may result in additional stretching of the quadriceps. All implanted cases resulted in substantial increases in bone strains compared with the natural knee, but increased strains in different regions. The anatomic patella demonstrated increased strains inferiorly, while the dome and medialized dome showed increases centrally. An understanding of the effect of implant design on patellar mechanics during kneeling may ultimately provide guidance to component designs that reduces the likelihood of knee pain and patellar fracture during kneeling.",
