        "Description/Abstract": "Understanding the genome and the interactions taking place on a molecular level in living cells is difficult. But it is critical for understanding gene regulation,transcription and cellular metabolism. Through 3D orbital tracking we can visualize transcription by observing the relationship between pre-mRNA synthesis and the protein-DNA binding of the transcription factor. This study establishes that we can track these molecules of interest, fluorescently labeled pre-mRNA and the transcription factor, glucocorticoid receptor during transcriptional activation. The data collected enhances our knowledge of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation and highlights previously unknown details about transcriptional activation and temporal coordination. \n\nOur research is funded by Research Corporation for Science Advancement and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through Grant GBMF5263.10 and by National Institute of General Medical Sciences through Grant 1R15GM123446.",
