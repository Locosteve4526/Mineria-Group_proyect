        "Description/Abstract": "To speak of \u201cnetworked learning\u201d (e.g., NLEC, 2021a) is to subsume a&lt;br&gt;wide range of educational questions under two overdetermined rubrics. \u201cLearning\u201d and \u201cnetworked\u201d are words that already carry a heavy semantic burden in both educational and technological discourses. First, the word \u201clearning\u201d\u2014as used in networked learning and in educational discourse generally\u2014tends to conflate the roles and responsibilities of student and teacher. Second, and again as in educational discourse broadly, the definitions provided for networked learning fail to clearly distinguish between \u201cis\u201d and \u201cought,\u201d between description and prescription. The task of carefully defining networked learning is justified as providing \u201ca concise description of a field of research and practice\u201d but relies on normative criteria that have no unambiguous descriptive corollaries. Third and finally, to speak of experi-ences as \u201cnetworked\u201d is to direct attention to structured, interconnected, or entangled manifestations of learning. This is incompatible with the ontological presuppositions of phenomenology and with phenomenological accounts of learning as \u201cnon-disponible:\u201d inaccessible, non-available, and non-controllable.",
