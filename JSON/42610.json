        "Description/Abstract": "Joseph Schwab\u2019s famous remark, that the field of curriculum is \u2018moribund\u2019\u2014no longer able \u2018to \u2026contribute significantly to the advancement of education\u2019\u2014has long echoed in curriculum studies. Although its specific meaning has certainly changed, it still rings in our ears today. It now applies as much to discussions in the US and UK as it does to those in Northern Europe\u2014where the cognate field of General Didaktik has been described as \u2018quiet\u2019 (Terhart, 2003, p. 25), or more recently, \u2018dead\u2019 (Zierer &amp; Seel 2012, p. 16). This \u2018virtual issue\u2019 of the Journal of Curriculum Studies brings together five articles of direct relevance to the contemporary \u2018crisis\u2019 in transatlantic studies of curriculum and instruction that also share a common focus on the question of curricular content. \u2018None of the many traditional American educational approaches have paid serious attention to the \u201cschool subject\u201d or \u201cinstructional content,\u201d\u2019 as Westbury and Doyle have pointed out (1992, p. 137); and others in curriculum studies see this as the underlying reason for its ongoing crisis. This introduction provides an overview of each article included and concludes by outlining a few of the possibilities and challenges presented by questions of \u2018content\u2019 and \u2018knowledge\u2019 in curriculum studies.",
