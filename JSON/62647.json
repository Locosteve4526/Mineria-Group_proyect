        "Description/Abstract": "Teaching in the unfamiliar landscape created by the COVID19 pandemic left two educators considering how to redefine rigor. Intent on bridging the divide that can separate well-intentioned teachers from students who have been marginalized in their educational experiences, we explored how to reframe our approach to teaching to make success feel possible for all students. While our endeavors were necessitated by the demanding environment created by COVID19, the ideas we generated are lasting and will remain part of our pedagogy when the pandemic is contained. At the heart of our conversation is seeking answers to the question: how do we prevent students from struggling in silence? ",
