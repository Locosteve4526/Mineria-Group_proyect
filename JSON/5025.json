        "Description/Abstract": "Stress is a common occurrence in many chronically ill patients, and researchers are calling for cost-effective stress-reduction interventions. Meditation techniques have demonstrated a host of benefits for chronically ill patients. The present study examined the effects of a 6-week Yoga Nidra meditation programme on perceived stress in multiple sclerosis and cancer patients. Overall stress was significantly reduced over the course of the programme.",
