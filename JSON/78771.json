        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;America has rapidly adopted a retirement system where most savers use the same kinds of tax-favored accounts to invest in essentially the same investments: passive index funds. Despite significant potential consequences, there is little understanding of why this happened, and it is often viewed as a chance development. I aim to better understand the causes by analyzing key events in the history of the new retirement regime. This analysis reveals consistent factors favoring the current system, including what we might call three ideologies: of ownership, individualism, and markets. Importantly, these ideologies have perfectly complemented the interests of large financial institutions.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;",
