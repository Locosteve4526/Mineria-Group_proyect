        "Description/Abstract": "I have found that that teaching required, introductory level, survey Humanities courses, meant for non-majors and generally taken by a reluctant, at best, student population, is a practice in public engagement itself. Student apprehension is high and \u201csatisfactory,\u201d if not learning, in the course is difficult to achieve. My lightning talk will address the extent to which both an examination of various Public Humanities projects as well as a deliberate exploration of the concept and field might not only help students in humanities majors recognize the practical implementations of their work, but also help the commonly doubtful (and at times annoyed) STEM and Social Science students understand the human and cultural contexts of their studies. Additionally, how do we get introductory humanities students to acknowledge what they learned from the Public Humanities, not only what they liked? And why is it important to distinguish between the two? I will provide examples from student feedback sessions and surveys for discussion, ask attendees to predict student responses using texting survey technology, and use those results to springboard into further dialogue on additional examples of successful adaptations of public humanities into Introductory Humanities courses.",
