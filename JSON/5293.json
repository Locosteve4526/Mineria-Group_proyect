        "Description/Abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are common causes of motor and cognitive deficits and are associated with the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (?-syn). This study investigated whether passive immunization with a novel monoclonal ?-syn antibody (9E4) against the C-terminus (CT) of ?-syn was able to cross into the CNS and ameliorate the deficits associated with ?-syn accumulation. In this study we demonstrate that 9E4 was effective at reducing behavioral deficits in the water maze, moreover, immunization with 9E4 reduced the accumulation of calpain-cleaved ?-syn in axons and synapses and the associated neurodegenerative deficits. In vivo studies demonstrated that 9E4 traffics into the CNS, binds to cells that display ?-syn accumulation and promotes ?-syn clearance via the lysosomal pathway. These results suggest that passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies against the CT of ?-syn may be of therapeutic relevance in patients with PD and DLB.",
