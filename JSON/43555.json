        "Description/Abstract": "Geoscience-specific professional development (PD) is expected to positively influence the teaching practices of participating faculty, but has not yet been quantified in a broad way. We used the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) to describe 236 undergraduate geoscience classes as Student-Centered (score \u226550), Transitional (score 31-49) or Teacher-Centered (score \u226430) and compared results with instructors\u2019 histories of PD participation. Instructors who attended PD (n=111) have higher average RTOP scores (44.5 vs. 34.2) and are more frequently observed teaching Student-Centered classes (33% vs. 13%) than instructors with no PD (p &lt; 0.001). Instructors who participate in PD that is topically-aligned with content taught during the classroom observation are likely to have RTOP scores that are higher by 13.5 points (p&lt;0.0001), and are 5.6 times more likely to teach a Student-Centered class than instructors who did not have topically-aligned PD. Comparable odds of teaching Student-Centered classes (5.8x) occur for instructors who attended two topical PD events but were observed teaching a different topic. Models suggest that instructors with at least 24 hours of PD are significantly more likely to teach a Student-Centered class than instructors with fewer PD hours. \n",
