        "Description/Abstract": "By Stuebner, S with Shallat, T. Chapter 8: Gut Fungi and Arthropods Share Intimate Symbiosis. In: \u201cIdaho Microbes: How tiny single-celled organisms can harm, or save, our world\u201d. Chapter 8 is with focus on some of the research on Gut Fungi (Trichomycetes) in my Boise State laboratory, with lots of stories including quotes from interviews with my students and a blending with fungal stories in general. Todd Shallat, at Boise State, Center for Idaho History and Politics has helped craft a popular writing book that is hoped to be used in local high schools. The original idea was to highlight \u201cmicrobe hunters\u201d in Idaho; in the end it has as much focus on the microbes themselves and how they can \u201charm or save our world\u201d but it really has blossomed into a very nice handbook/inspiration for citizens/students alike. It has been sent to the printers and I include a copy of the cover and chapter 8 herein. The book was released in Dec. 2015. ISBN 978-0-9907363-0-1. A couple press releases highlight and link to it here: Update News online; Link to Buy it online.\n",
