        "Description/Abstract": "Dimension functions for finite dimensional spaces do did not have a natural generalization to infinite dimensional spaces. We found that appropriate embedding into a topological group combined with an infinite game provides natural extensions of the finite dimensional functions. Much is to still be understood about this new approach to dimension.\nRole:  Principal",
