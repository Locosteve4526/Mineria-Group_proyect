        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;KID Newsradio's Jolyn Thomas brings to life the stories of Idaho's Cold cases. Every Friday Jolyn highlights a different\u00a0 Idaho cold case from a deck of cards called Idaho's Cold Cases. This deck of cards was designed to hand out to inmates and as they play cards they see the faces and cases of those still missing or killers yet to be caught. The hope is that this deck of cards will spark conversation and turn into new clues to the case.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;",
