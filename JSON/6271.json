        "Description/Abstract": "This study attempts to determine if various self-reported evaluations of a person's dreams can explain significant unique variance in the number of coital partners he or she has experienced. A number of gender differences were found. While promiscuous females were most ashamed of their sexual dreams, promiscuous males were least ashamed. Although males reported significantly more coital partners than females, more variance was explained in the female model than in the male model. Disinhibition was the most powerful predictor of number of partners for both sexes. As predicted by evolutionary theory, gender differences in sexual dreaming and behavior reflect gender-differentiated reproductive strategies as predicted by evolutionary theory.",
