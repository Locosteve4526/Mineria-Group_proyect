        "Description/Abstract": "This paper discusses the use of character images to\r\ndetermine the parameters of an image degradation model.\r\nThe acute angles in character images provide information\r\nused to find the model parameters. Three experiments are\r\nconducted to evaluate the use of characters. In the first\r\nexperiment, large quantities of corners from character\r\nimages are used to investigate how their contribution\r\naffects the mean and the standard deviation of the parameter\r\nestimators. In the second experiment, we focus on the\r\nrelationship between the angles of the corners used in estimation\r\nand the estimation results. In the last experiment,\r\nwe examine how likely the text in a common page would\r\noffer a reasonable estimation result compared to the\r\nresults from experiments 1 and 2.",
