        "Description/Abstract": "This study examined daytime mood, stress, and drinking-related consequences as predictors of evening alcohol use.  Twenty-four moderate to heavy drinkers completed diaries twice daily for 28 days.  Results of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses indicated daytime negative mood states predicted higher levels of evening alcohol use, whereas negative drinking-related consequences predicted lower levels of subsequent alcohol use.  Clinical implications include emphasizing negative drinking-related consequences in enhancing client motivation to change.  Results also support routine assessment of anxiety and depressed mood to help clinicians identify risk factors for drinking and provide intervention strategies targeting negative mood states to improve treatment outcomes.",
