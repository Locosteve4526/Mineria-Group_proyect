        "Description/Abstract": "Most articles written about MOOCs over the past few years have unfortunately come from the popular press and were not based on empirical research. While empirical research on MOOCs is increasing, relatively little has been written about what it is like to teach a MOOC. In this mixed methods exploratory study, we set out to capture the perceptions and experiences of instructors teaching massive open online courses. In the following paper, we present the results of our inquiry and implications for practice.",
