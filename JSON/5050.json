        "Description/Abstract": "In recent years, there have been several reports on the formation of I?III?VI2 nanoparticles through the decomposition of single-source precursors (SSPs) using thermolysis,(1-7) photolysis,(8) and microwave irradiation.(9, 10) Uses of SSPs in preparation of nanomaterials present distinct  advantages such as precise control in reaction conditions and  stoichiometry as SSPs contain all necessary elements in a single  molecule. Despite the obvious advantages of SSPs, to the best of our  knowledge, no studies have been conducted using combinations of SSPs to  form quaternary or multinary chalcopyrite nanoparticles.",
