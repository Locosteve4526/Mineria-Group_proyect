        "Description/Abstract": "Closed-loop neuromodulation systems aim to treat a variety of neurological\nconditions by dynamically delivering and adjusting therapeutic electrical\nstimulation in response to a patient's neural state, recorded in real-time.\nExisting systems are limited by low channel counts, lack of algorithmic\nflexibility, and distortion of recorded signals from large, persistent\nstimulation artifacts. Here, we describe a device that enables new research\napplications requiring high-throughput data streaming, low-latency biosignal\nprocessing, and truly simultaneous sensing and stimulation. The Wireless\nArtifact-free Neuromodulation Device (WAND) is a miniaturized, wireless neural\ninterface capable of recording and stimulating on 128 channels with on-board\nprocessing to fully cancel stimulation artifacts, detect neural biomarkers, and\nautomatically adjust stimulation parameters in a closed-loop fashion. It\ncombines custom application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), an on-board\nFPGA, and a low-power bidirectional radio. We validate wireless, long-term\nrecordings of local field potentials (LFP) and real-time cancellation of\nstimulation artifacts in a behaving nonhuman primate (NHP). We use WAND to\ndemonstrate a closed-loop stimulation paradigm to disrupt movement preparatory\nactivity during a delayed-reach task in a NHP in vivo. This wireless device,\nleveraging custom ASICs for both neural recording and electrical stimulation\nmodalities, makes possible a neural interface platform technology to\nsignificantly advance both neuroscientific discovery and preclinical\ninvestigations of stimulation-based therapeutic interventions.\n[Journal_ref: ]",
