        "Description/Abstract": "Habitat destruction and global climate change are two major threats to  the persistence of ecosystems. The probability that a species survives  such changes depends on its ability to track environmental shifts,  either by moving between patches of habitat or by rapidly adapting to  local conditions. This explains why the evolution of dispersal has  become an integrative topic of paramount importance in evolutionary and  behavioral ecology, as demonstrated by a recent conferencehttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534799017577#ref_FN1&quot;&gt;*. A wide panel of researchers,  who highlighted the recent major advances and the most promising lines  of future research, were present at this meeting.",
