        "Description/Abstract": "Instances of anterior knee pain and patellar fracture are significant complications following total knee replacement (TKR). Bone strain measured in the patella can provide an indication of patellar fracture risk and may also be related to anterior knee pain. The objective of this study was to develop subject-specific finite element models of the patellofemoral (PF) joint including density-mapped material properties to gain insight into the patellar bone strain distribution in the natural and implanted knee. In eight subjects, the volume of bone experiencing strains &gt;0.5% in the implanted condition was \u223c200% larger, on average, than the natural condition. An inverse relationship with a correlation of -0.74 was established between postoperative bone volume and strain in the implanted specimens, suggesting that patellar geometry may be a useful indicator of postoperative strain. Comparing strains between regions (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral), it was found that although highly strained bone was evenly distributed between medial and lateral regions in the natural case, the implanted specimens demonstrated significantly larger volumes of highly strained bone medially as a result of substantially lower modulus bone in the medial compartment. Understanding distributions of PF strain may aid in preoperative identification of those patients at risk for patellar fracture or anterior knee pain, guidance regarding altered component placement for at-risk patients, and design of components considering the implications of PF load transfer and patellar strain distribution.",
