        "Description/Abstract": "As more trombonists use the alto trombone on recitals, finding music from various historical periods becomes a problem. The works of the baroque and classical periods for alto trombone, such as the Albrechtsberger and Wagenseil concerti, are now performed enough to be considered &quot;warhorses&quot;! Although many contemporary composers, such as Frigyes Hidas and Thom Ritter George, have written excellent new works for the instrument, 20th-century recital music for the alto trombone is still scarce. An alternative is to transcribe works from the brass literature; one of the finest is the Sonata for Alto Horn by Paul Hindemith.",
