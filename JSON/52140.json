        "Description/Abstract": "The path towards the long-term prosperity of our species passes through the sustainability of urban environments. A transition to sustainability has to take place within socioecological complex adaptive systems. Thus, policy-making for urban sustainability in the 21st century requires that we seriously consider the relevance of a complex adaptive systems approach. This paper offers a new roadmap for policymakers operating in the space of urban sustainability. Firstly, we attempt to clarify how complexity science can have practical relevance sustainability policies through our understanding of emergent phenomena and employ a small-N comparative analysis of case studies. Secondly, we discuss various challenges that complexity places on policy-making, focusing on the concepts of predictive capacity, causal explanation, the unconscious mind and the erosion of moral sentiments; we argue that the synthesis of these ideas provides a more nuanced and useful view for policy-making in the urban sustainability context.",
