        "Description/Abstract": "Whether the nature of policing services allows for economies of scale to be realized is an important question for police departments for reasons of both cost and efficiency. Southwick (2005) estimates police production and demand in order to determine whether there are economies of scale among police departments in New York state. Southwick's (2005) method is unique in that it incorporates measures of market power to predict police efficiency. The present study replicates Southwick (2005) in a low density, low population western state. Southwick's results for New York State are markedly different from the results found for Idaho, thus questioning the external validity of Southwick's model as applied to a relatively low population state. The findings also indicate that, controlling for relevant variables, crime in Idaho is highly correlated with population, suggesting that police departments in low density/population states would not achieve efficiency gains through consolidation.",
