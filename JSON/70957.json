        "Description/Abstract": "In a growing election forecasting industry in academe, forecasts of Israeli elections are notably absent. In part, this is due to Israel's complex political space (small country, single member district, low electoral threshold, propotional representation, two dozen parties competing for Knesset seats). I propose a simple model of Israeli elections based on an accountability framework. Using data from 1973 onward, I forecast the election results three months prior to the elections. The model performs accurately, but needs more precision.",
