        "Description/Abstract": "This article attends to revealing complicated, intersecting, and symbiotic relationships of mothering, academia, and art education practice. The authors seek to articulate rhizomatic interconnections through their narratives and art, attempting to make sense of what it means to educate, nurture, and care within a location of power, in the symbiotic entanglement that ensues, through understanding the transformation that happens when the authors studied personal educational experiences within the context of motherhood. A description of practicing curricula from the perspective of m/otherwork--the intertwining of motherhood and scholarship in its various forms--is conceptualized through three distinctly different lenses encompassing various stages of experience of being mothers and art educators.",
