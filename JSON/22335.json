        "Description/Abstract": "The supply chain literature has highlighted the role of internal integration (i.e., cross-functional integration) and external integration (i.e., cross-firm integration) in coordinating operations, facilitating exchanges, and ultimately improving supply chain performance. Few studies however have considered both internal and external integration and even fewer have attempted to study the internal-external integration linkage. What is interesting is that this internal-external linkage is simply assumed to exist and to be intuitively obvious from a theoretical development standpoint. This research attempts to extend prior work by 1) studying purchasing and engineering integration and its role on integrating suppliers into new product development (NPD) ventures and, 2) positing a specific mechanism linking internal and external integration: the development of a shared vision between purchasing and engineering. To address these issues, we collected survey data from a set of 180 matched buyers and engineers dyads at a leading automotive component manufacturer.",
