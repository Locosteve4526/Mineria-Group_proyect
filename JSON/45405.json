        "Description/Abstract": "This paper in the session will provide background on research related to assessing students\u2019 cognition in mathematics (i.e., what students do and do not understand as opposed to correctness of a response) and the type of evidence necessary to support inferences related to student cognition. This will be done through an example situated in proportional reasoning. Evidence from individual cognitive interviews and the framework for analysis will be presented. Once the background and examples are presented, session attendees with engage in a discussion around (a) the realities of assessing cognition with relatively efficient items in terms of administration, scoring, and interpretation, and (b) the type of evidence educators should require from test developers, or gather for themselves, to support valid inferences related to student cognition. \n",
