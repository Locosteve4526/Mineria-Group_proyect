        "Description/Abstract": "This study quantified leg stiffness and vGRF measures for males and females using different stride lengths to run with four body borne loads (20, 25, 30, and 35\u202fkg). Thirty-six participants (20 males and 16 females) ran at 4.0\u202fm/s using either: their preferred stride length (PSL), or strides 15% longer (LSL) and shorter (SSL) than PSL. Leg stiffness and vGRF measures, including peak vGRF, impact peak and loading rate, were submitted to a RM ANOVA to test the main effect and interactions of load, stride length, and sex. Leg stiffness was greater with the 30\u202fkg (p\u202f=\u202f0.016) and 35\u202fkg (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001) compared to the 20\u202fkg load, but decreased as stride lengthened from SSL to PSL (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001) and PSL to LSL (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001). Males exhibited greater leg stiffness than females with SSL (p\u202f=\u202f0.029). Yet, males decreased leg stiffness with each increase in stride length (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001; p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001), while females only decreased leg stiffness between PSL and LSL (p\u202f=\u202f0.014). Peak vGRF was greater with the addition of body borne load (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001) and increase in stride length (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001). Both impact peak and loading rate were greater with the 30\u202fkg (p\u202f=\u202f0.034; p\u202f=\u202f0.043) and 35\u202fkg (p\u202f=\u202f0.004; p\u202f=\u202f0.015) compared to the 20\u202fkg load, and increased as stride lengthened from SSL to PSL (p\u202f=\u202f0.001; p\u202f=\u202f0.004) and PSL to LSL (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001; p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001). Running with body borne load may elevate injury risk by increasing leg stiffness and vGRFs. Injury risk may further increase when using longer strides to run with body borne load.",
