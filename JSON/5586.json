        "Description/Abstract": "The Lift-and-Raise hamstring flexibility test was developed as a field-based assessment to eliminate the effects of individual and developmental differences in arm, leg, and trunk lengths found with the commonly used Sit-and-Reach tests. This study assessed the initial reliability of the prototype instrument and its validity by comparing obtained values from a Cybex Testing and Rehabilitation System. Flexibility of the left leg was assessed on 53 college-aged participants (women, n = 28; men, n = 25) using the Lift-and-Raise test by 2 independent testers to determine initial reliability measures. The Cybex Testing and Rehabilitation System was compared with the Lift-and-Raise test when assessing the left hamstring of 39 college-aged students (women, n = 23; men, n = 16) to establish initial validity. A high intraclass correlation coefficient emerged between the 2 testers (r = 0.944) on the Lift-and-Raise instrument and between the Lift-and-Raise test and the Cybex testing protocol (r = 0.891). Based on initial results, the Lift-and-Raise test seems to be a reliable and valid test to measure hamstring flexibility.",
