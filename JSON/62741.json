This exercise will overview a\u00a0scaffolded program learning outcome focusing on personal brand development. Definitions, assignments, and rubrics will be reviewed and discussed at the assessment levels of introducing, developing, and mastering personal brands. The scaffolding technique will be demonstrated as it was applied across a MBA program, utilizing three different courses in order to achieve the desired results in student learning. Participants will be challenged to come up with a draft plan for scaffolding a relevant learning outcome within their own programs.",
