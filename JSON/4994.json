        "Description/Abstract": "The present study compared disordered eating behavior in high school and  college athletes. Results indicated significant differences between  high school and college athletes in disordered eating, body  dissatisfaction, and excessive exercise. Females were more likely to  display disordered eating behaviors and body dissatisfaction than were  males. Self-esteem correlated with body dissatisfaction, disordered  eating, and excessive exercise. Predictors of eating disordered behavior  in college athletes were body dissatisfaction and self-esteem, with  body dissatisfaction having more of an influence. For high school  athletes, the primary predictor of disordered eating was body  dissatisfaction followed by excessive exercise. Results from the present  study suggests that when athletes are dissatisfied with their bodies,  they are more likely to develop disordered eating and exercise  behaviors. There are indications that coaches and trainers need to be  aware of the possibility of disordered eating and exercise behaviors in  athletes, and watch for the identified predictors of those behaviors.",
