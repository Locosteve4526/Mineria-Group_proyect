        "Description/Abstract": "Nuclear graphite is low in atomic weight, capable of absorbing large amounts of heat, and works effectively as a moderator in nuclear reactors. The quality, microstructure, and mechanical properties of nuclear graphite partially dictate the in-service lifetime of reactor components, thus underlining the importance of simulating and understanding the microstructural changes that nuclear graphite undergoes in reactors. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), one can simulate the irradiation damage that nuclear reactor components typically experience and observe the microstructural changes in real time at the nanometer scale. A vital aspect of simulating the irradiation damage that nuclear graphite would experience in a nuclear reactor is utilizing samples that are artifact-free and do not contain irradiation damage prior to observation. This study compares several TEM sample-preparation techniques and identifies the strengths and weaknesses associated with each method. ",
