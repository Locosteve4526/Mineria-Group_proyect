        "Description/Abstract": "As the world continues to attempt to live with the COVID-19 pandemic, one major topic of conversation has been regarding the potential legal liability of businesses who, through allowing people into their facilities, unknowingly subject patrons and others to the risks of contracting the deadly disease.  At the same time, two cases decided by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the past two years\u2014Mayall v. USA Water Polo (2018) and Dent v. National Football League (NFL) (2020)\u2014have represented dramatic shifts in how the California courts are set to look at negligence, specifically the voluntary undertaking doctrine.  This Presentation will explore how these shifts in precedent affect a wide variety of health-and-safety issues, including the concussion return-to-play protocols explored in Mayall, the prescription drug abuse alleged in Dent, and various organizational attempts to continue play in the world of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
