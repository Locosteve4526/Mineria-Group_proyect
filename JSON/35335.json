        "Description/Abstract": "We analyze the representation of binary relations in general, and in partic-\nular of functions and of total antisymmetric relations, in monadic third order logic,\nthat is, the simple typed theory of sets with three types. We show that there is no\ngeneral representation of functions or of total antisymmetric relations in this theory.\nWe present partial representations of functions and of total antisymmetric relations\nwhich work for large classes of these relations, and show that there is an adequate\nrepresentation of cardinality in this theory (a result already shown in a somewhat\ndifferent way by Henrard in unpublished work, but our approach differs from his in\nproviding representations of bijections between sets in a stronger sense). The rela-\ntion of our work to similar work by Henrard (to whom we are indebted) and Allen\nHazen (who arrived at related results independently) is discussed. This work can be\nunderstood as part of a program of assessing the capabilities of (relatively) weak log-\nical frameworks: our results are applicable for example, to the framework in David\nLewis\u2019s\nParts of Classes\n.",
