        "Description/Abstract": "Students too often learn material from a textbook and lectures with the intent of regurgitation on a test and leaving nothing in their mind.  The question in class too often becomes what do I need to know for the test, and not how can I incorporate this into my life.  Many years ago, educational experts realized that students who engage in activities related to school subjects, learn more efficiently, and remember what they have learned much longer than those who do not (Tabe, 1962; Tyler, 1949).  Recently, others have agreed, saying &quot;Service, combined with learning, adds value to each and transforms both&quot; (Honnet &amp; Poulsen, 1989).  Many educational and political leaders have begun to advocate that young people become involved in their communities to enhance their classroom learning.",
