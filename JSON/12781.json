The control group received traditional nursing care (TNC), and the intervention group received HT treatment in addition to traditional nursing care. Pre and post data collection included measurement of pain, anxiety, blood pressure and pulse. \nResults: Results from this study suggest that HT treatment was at least as effective as traditional nursing care for reduction in pain and more effective in reducing anxiety. The use of narcotics was decreased with HT. No significant effects were found on blood pressure and pulse.\n",
