Experiential learning is often used to develop affective competency, which can be challenging to deliver in the virtual learning environment (VLE). A virtual synchronous role-play (VSRP) simulation was developed focusing on affective competencies and delivered in an online course. Utilizing Zoom\u2122, students recorded simulation participation and brief peer debriefing, followed by an individual reflection. Lessons learned included the need for detailed instructions and resources concerning timeframes, environmental expectations, and technology. Student feedback indicated the simulation contributed to affective competency development.&lt;br&gt;Keywords: Affective competency; Online; Role-play; Simulation; Virtual&lt;/p&gt;",
