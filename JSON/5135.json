        "Description/Abstract": "Despite impressive numbers of hockey participants, there is little research examining elite female ice hockey players. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe the physical characteristics of elite female ice hockey players who were trying out for the 2010 U.S. Women's Ice Hockey team. Twenty-three women participated in the study and were evaluated on: body mass (kg), height (cm), age (y) vertical jump (cm), standing long jump (cm), 1 RM front squat (kg), front squat/body mass (%), 1 RM bench press (kg), bench press/body mass (%), pull ups, and body composition (% body fat). Athletes in this sample were 24.7 + 3.1 years of age, and 169.7 + 6.9 cm tall; on average, they weighed 70.4 + 7.1 kg, and reported percent body fat of 15.8 + 1.9%. Mean vertical jump was 50.3 + 5.7 cm and standing long jump was 214.8 + 10.9 cm. Mean 1RM for upper body strength (bench press) was 65.3 + 12.2 kg (95.1 + 15.5% of body mass) and 1RM for lower body (front squat) was 88.6 + 11.2 kg (127.7 + 16.3% of body mass). This study is the first to report physical characteristics of elite female ice hockey players from the United States. Data should assist strength and conditioning coaches in identifying talent, testing for strengths and weaknesses, comparing future teams to these indicators, and designing programs that will enhance the performance capabilities of female ice hockey athletes.",
