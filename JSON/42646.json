        "Description/Abstract": "The language used to frame and discuss educational issues, both in scientific publication and in everyday talk, shapes broader possibilities for theory and practice. It both enables and limits ways of defining and addressing pedagogical concerns, from general policy to the minutiae of practice. For example, to speak of education as \u201ca process of living and not [as] a preparation for future living\u201d (Dewey, 1897, p. 78) has rather different implications for theory and practice than conceiving it as a form of \u201chuman control\u201d exercised through \u201cfundamental laws of change\u201d (Thorndike, 1912, pp. 95, 97).  In this paper, I inquire into the significance of educational vocabularies by focusing specifically on the history of the term \u201cself\u201d in the field of educational psychology. ",
