        "Description/Abstract": ": This study aimed to investigate the dual-task effect on conventional center of pressure (CoP) outcomes, CoP oscillations, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation between young and older adults. : Fourteen healthy older adults (age: 66.25\u2009\u00b1\u20093.43\u2009years) and another fourteen gender-matched young adults (age: 19.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75\u2009years) participated in this study. Participants completed single-task and dual-task standing trials in a fixed order. The displacement of CoP and PFC activation were recorded using a Force plate and a functional near-infrared spectroscopy system, respectively. Two-way MANOVAs were used to examine the group and task effects. Additionally, the Pearson correlation analyses were used to investigate the relationship between CoP oscillations and PFC activation. : Our results showed a worse balance performance, greater CoP oscillations of 0-0.1 (11.03\u2009\u00b1\u20098.24 vs. 23.20\u2009\u00b1\u200912.54\u2009cm) and 0.1-0.5 (13.62\u2009\u00b1\u20099.30 vs. 30.00\u2009\u00b1\u200923.12\u2009cm) Hz in the medial-lateral direction and higher right (dorsomedial: -0.0003\u2009\u00b1\u20090.021 vs. 0.021\u2009\u00b1\u20090.021 &amp; ventrolateral: 0.0087\u2009\u00b1\u20090.047 vs. 0.025\u2009\u00b1\u20090.045\u2009mol/ml) and left (dorsomedial: 0.0033\u2009\u00b1\u20090.024 vs. 0.020\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025 &amp; ventrolateral: 0.0060\u2009\u00b1\u20090.037 vs. 0.034\u2009\u00b1\u20090.037\u2009mol/ml) PFC activation in response to a secondary cognitive task in older adults (\u2009&lt;\u2009.05). Older adults also showed significant positive correlations between CoP oscillations in the anterior-posterior direction and PFC activation under the single-task standing. : These results suggest that older adults presented a loss of postural automaticity contributing to cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, heightened CoP oscillations at 0-0.5\u2009Hz in response to a secondary cognitive task could provide evidence of a loss of automaticity, which might be associated with a greater reliance on the sensory inputs.",
