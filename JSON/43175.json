        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\u2014As the number of teachers teaching computer science\ngrows, it is increasingly important to be mindful of the\ntraining they receive with respect to broadening participation in\ncomputer science. Through our program, we have trained over\n50 teachers in the greater Boise Metropolitan region, who have\nin turn taught over 1400 students computing concepts through\ncourses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and AP CS\nA. These courses have an excellent curriculum that contains\na mix of computational thinking concepts such as a focus on\ncreativity, abstraction, coding, as well as increasing awareness\nabout the cyber footprint of the students with respect to security\nand privacy. While the curriculum is excellent, we need to be\nmore mindful about incorporating pedagogical strategies that\npromote inclusive teaching especially for women and minorities\nwho are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.\nTo address the challenges associated with teaching a truly\ninclusive course, we developed a new course titled \u201cInclusive\nStrategies for Computer Science Education\u201d that draws attention\nto the strategies that have been studied over the years in\nSTEM and CS education literature. We present the contents\nof the course along with a post-hoc qualitative survey on the\napplicability and practicality of the material discussed in the\ncourse.",
