        "Description/Abstract": "Beginning in 1975, intensive archaeological investigations were conducted in the south central Owyhee Uplands of Idaho (see for summary Plew, 1980, 1985). These investigations resulted in the description of a 6,000 year chronology and settlement-subsistence pattern (see Plew 1985). In the course of the investigations large numbers of petroglyph sites were recorded. Three of these sites represent large and extensive individual panels at Big Springs, Camas, and Pole Creeks which are located within an area of roughly thirty square miles (see Figure 1). A complete inventory of these sites was completed during the 1980 field season. The present report is a descriptive synthesis of these data.",
