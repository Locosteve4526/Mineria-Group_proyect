        "Description/Abstract": "The Snake River Valley AVA in southwestern Idaho and eastern Oregon covers over 21,000 sq. km, but wine grape production is located in only a few districts. The understanding of the heterogeneity of the soil and climate elements of the Sunnyslope District, the largest area of wine grape production in the AVA, is not well understood. We developed a soil and climate study of established and developing vineyard sites in the district, and present the initial findings in this paper. In 10 vineyards sites, we installed environmental monitoring stations that measure and record meteorological and soil moisture and temperature data useful for vineyard management. We also dug 17 soil pits and measured, described, photographed, and sampled from horizons identified to depths of down to two meters. Weather station data collected at six sites between June 1, 2015 and January 31, 2016 show substantial differences in GDDs between the warmest and coolest site, yet they are separated by only two kilometers, and differences were also noted in nighttime temperatures late in the season. Most of the soils are Aridic Entisols, formed under very limited precipitation regimes. Profiles record complexity in both diversity of parent material ranging from single source to contrasting materials and depositional environments. Additionally, several pits contained restrictive layers, such as lime-cemented petrocalcic horizons. Texture analysis of the soil samples documented that about 90% of the soil horizons in the 17 soils have sandy loam, loamy sand, sand, or silt loam textures and therefore are well drained to excessively well drained. The heterogeneity of climate and soils shows the importance of collecting data at resolution high enough to best capture the diversity of soils and climate at a site so as to better inform cultivar selection.
