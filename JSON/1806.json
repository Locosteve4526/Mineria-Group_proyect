        "Description/Abstract": "This paper introduces and explicates the neologism \u201cnecroecology\u201d as a critical, philosophical approach for studying human-nonhuman relations in the context of British colonialism and its aftermath. Necroecology also names an aesthetic that originated in the mid-nineteenth century as a direct consequence of the 1857 Indian Uprising. This paper develops its hypotheses through readings of Rudyard Kipling\u2019s short story \u201cThe Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes\u201d and E. M. Forster\u2019s A Passage to India. ",
