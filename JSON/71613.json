        "Description/Abstract": "How does a nonprofit with an online presence develop a privacy policy, and are there best practice examples that could serve as models? A content analysis of nonprofit online privacy policies was conducted to determine the presence of an exemplary policy based on nonprofit rank and the pattern of provisions, policy length, reading grade level, and policy year. Findings: on average, 33 of 71 provisions appeared among the 100 policies. Except for the relationship between word count and the sum of policy provisions, there was no significant pattern between the number of provisions, policy length, reading grade level, year and the ranking of the nonprofit. While a nonprofit would be unlikely to find an exemplary policy among those listed on the 100 nonprofits websites, the authors offer insights from the study and further suggestions for developing a privacy policy.",
