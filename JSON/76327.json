        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our team worked alongside the Boise Homeless Coalition to help address the prevalent problem of homelessness. Together, we identified the problem of homeless rates related to mental health problems. Our research approach included sorting through databases, articles, academic journals, and studies on reducing homeless rates. Our literature review helped us identify practical ways to address the connection between homelessness and mental health challenges and develop four leading suggestions for the Boise Homeless Coalition. First, working together with housing groups, healthcare providers, community programs, and the justice system can make services easier to access and less stressful for everyone. Second, creating programs that meet the specific needs of different groups instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach can lead to better results. Third, giving people, especially those with mental health issues, the choice to live in integrated communities can help them feel respected and independent. Lastly, having clear goals and values for the organization can create better focus and teamwork. These ideas can help the Boise Homeless Coalition reduce homelessness and improve the lives of those they support. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
