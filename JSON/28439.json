In 2008, Albertsons Library started lending library-use-only laptops to Boise State students. In 2011, iPads were added to the collection.

We will discuss the infrastructure required to support the use of multiple mobile devices, including wireless networks, IT support, budgeting, pre-loading apps onto devices, bulk app purchasing, iPad reimaging, and patron privacy. Join us in this session to discuss technology lending, loan limits, fines and fees, and practical feedback about our experiences. We will end the session with questions and answers and group discussion to learn about others\u2019 technology lending experiences, and successes and challenges at other libraries. ",
