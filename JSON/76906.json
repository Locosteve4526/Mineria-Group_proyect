        "Description/Abstract": "This is a media studies project that I am currently working on. In it I trace the evolution of the phrase family values. I show how it began as a contested term in the early 1990s. Both Democrats and Republicans wanted voters to associate the phrase with their party. The media also ran stories that reflected this debate. There were also questions about what family values were, and if they included things like a strong economy, and a good job market, or were simply social issues like marriage and family. By 2024, the meaning of family values had shrunk to being about only social issues and it was also only associated with Republicans.",
