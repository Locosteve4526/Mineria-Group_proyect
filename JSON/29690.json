        "Description/Abstract": "The relationship between trust and task performance in virtual teams is well established. Currently, studies examine key antecedent to trust in groups, the perceived ability of other group members. While it has been shown that perceived ability of teammates contributes to trust, little is known about how the perceptions of ability are formed in virtual teams. In this study, teams performed a decision-making task in a synchronous computer-mediated communication environment. As teams were limited to verbal communication, the authors examined the relationship between participant ability and verbal communication amount, as well as team member perceptions of their partners\u2019 ability based on the amount of participation. The results show that participants who perceive themselves to have higher ability communicate more, whereas those who speak more are rated by their teammates to have lower ability. Based on the results, post hoc analysis explored the relationship between reduced participation and perceived ability.",
