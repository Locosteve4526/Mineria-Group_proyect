        "Description/Abstract": "Air sparging is a popular remediation technology for treating soil and groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the VOC removal process during air sparging is rendered ineffective because of the random formation of air channels, creating preferential paths for airflow and, in turn, limiting remediation to these channels referred to as the zone of influence (ZOI). Promising methods such as pulsation of air injection implemented to improve the effectiveness of air sparging through cyclic operation are also time-consuming. In order to better understand airflow to improve the effectiveness of air sparging, a controlled experimental research was performed. This paper presents a laboratory investigation of the effects of initial and further increases in the injected air\u2019s pressure on airflow pattern within a glass-bead medium used as an analogous medium to soil. Digital images of the airflow patterns were collected; these images show an increase in the radius of influence (ROI) and ZOI due to the initial air-pressure increase, especially when a higher overburden pressure (dry soil simulant) is available above the water-saturated zone. Further increases in the air pressure seem to have no measurable effect on the ROI and the shape of the ZOI.",
