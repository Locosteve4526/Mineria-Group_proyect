        "Description/Abstract": "How does public messaging affect public support for, or opposition to, a U.S. military presence abroad? This study focuses on Poland as a case of a frontline ally with an exceptionally high external security threat and a U.S. military presence. Using a pre-registered survey experiment, we explore how external security threats, economic gains, and the distance of a new military installation affect attitudes toward the U.S. military. Our results show that despite a substantial increase in support for the U.S. military presence since 2020, informational prompts about security threats and basing\u2019s possible economic benefits do not increase public support for a new U.S. military base. Alternatively, the distance of a proposed military base seems to matter more, with respondents having a higher probability of expressing more support for a more distant military installation. Additional robustness tests reveal that previous individual contact with U.S. military personnel somewhat moderates that effect.",
