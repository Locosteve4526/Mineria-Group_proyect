        "Description/Abstract": "Natural polymers are extensively utilized as scaffold materials in tissue engineering and 3D disease modeling due to their general features of cytocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to mimic the architecture and mechanical properties of the native tissue. A major limitation of many polymeric scaffolds is their autofluorescence under common imaging methods. This autofluorescence, a particular challenge with silk fibroin materials, can interfere with the visualization of fluorescently labeled cells and proteins grown on or in these scaffolds, limiting the assessment of outcomes. Here, Sudan Black B (SBB) was successfully used prefixation prior to cell seeding, in various silk matrices and 3D model systems to quench silk autofluorescence for live cell imaging. SBB was also trialed postfixation in silk hydrogels. We validated that multiple silk scaffolds pretreated with SBB (hexafluoro-2-propanol-silk scaffolds, salt-leached sponges, gel-spun catheters, and sponge-gel composite scaffolds) cultured with fibroblasts, adipose tissue, neural cells, and myoblasts demonstrated improved image resolution when compared to the nonpretreated scaffolds, while also maintaining normal cell behavior (attachment, growth, proliferation, differentiation). SBB pretreatment of silk scaffolds is an option for scaffold systems that require autofluorescence suppression.",
