        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Prior research has demonstrated the importance of the probation officer-client relationship for improving supervision outcomes, including reduced recidivism. Despite this emerging body of research, few studies have explored the influence of client characteristics or supervision experiences in shaping the quality of their therapeutic alliance (TA). And while past research has often divided clients into groups of low, middle, or high TA, such approaches may underestimate meaningful variations across probationers\u2019 relationship quality. Using self-reported data collected from a sample of individuals on probation in a western state (n= 185), this study uses latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify whether distinct profiles exists based on probationers\u2019 perceptions of the therapeutic alliance. Results indicated the presence of two latent profiles, distinguishing clients who reported either a relatively moderate or especially strong TA with their supervision officers. The findings from this study hold significant implications for policy and practice that will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;",
