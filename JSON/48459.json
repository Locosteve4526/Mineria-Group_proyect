        "Description/Abstract": "Article-in-progress about the origins of the Mudejar style in the Iberian peninsula, which began in the city of Sahagun in the kingdom of Leon around the 12th century. The Mudejars were Muslims who remained in Spain after the Reconquista, living under protected status. My hypothesis is that Mudejar craftsmen and artists taught their skills to local Christians (and possibly Jews), working side-by-side with them on significant architectural projects in an expression of cultural hybridity.",
