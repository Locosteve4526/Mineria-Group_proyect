        "Description/Abstract": "The COVID-19 crisis transformed the way we communicate with each other. Pre-existing theoretical frameworks can build structure out of the chaos; social-interaction theory is one of these. During our social distancing and prior to the vaccine's arrival, physical distancing was adopted as the primary strategy to 'flatten the curve' of the virus's spread. The human desire to connect, however, led to increasing reliance on social-platform outlets. Yet meaningful communication in these forums is elusive and often results in unsatisfying interactions that lack the natural cadence of in-person communications. There is a need to reflect back on how and why our various styles of social-media consumption often paradoxically increase rather than ameliorate our feelings of social isolation. Following this overview, the authors will recommend ways to recognize and change such counterproductive patterns of online activity.",
