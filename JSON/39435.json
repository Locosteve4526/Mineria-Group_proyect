        "Description/Abstract": "Following a systematic literature review of growth mindset in adult learning scholarship, we analyzed the studies focusing on implications for adult learners in workplaces or other organizations. The findings suggest that there is an interaction between individual mindset and group or organizational mindset. There are also interactions between supervisors' and employees' mindsets. Interventions in these organizations are supportive of enhancing mindsets from fixed to growth.  This presentation shares outcomes from 6 empirical studies with suggestions for growth mindset interventions that can be adopted in other settings. ",
