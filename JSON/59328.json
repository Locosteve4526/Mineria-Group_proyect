        "Description/Abstract": "We describe results of a 32-month, prospective, controlled before and after trial investigating the impact of co-timed antimalarial mass drug administration (MDA) with population-based indoor residual spraying (IRS) on malaria burden in a high transmission region of NE Uganda. The study began in November 2016, and all arms had universal campaign coverage with non-PBO nets delivered by the Ministry of Health in April 2017. The study interventions were 4 rounds of IRS with pirimiphos methyl, alone or in combination with a simultaneous MDA with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The third reference arm had nets alone. The study population was an open cohort of approximately 52,000 people in Katakwi District, Uganda. The three arms of ~16,000-18,0000 persons each were contiguous sub-counties with heavy entomological pressure. Prevalence in children under 5 measured by qPCR at baseline ranged from 48.5% to 58.4 %. All households in the study area were mapped and enumerated twice yearly. In the MDA arm, all medically screened persons over 6 months were eligible, and all households in intervention arms were eligible for IRS. MDA was directly observed day 1, and followed up after. Coverage of MDA was ~80%, and IRS coverage was ~98%. 6 cross-sectional prevalence surveys using rapid diagnostic tests, expert microscopy and qPCR were conducted during the study period, and a spatio-temporal geostatistical analysis was performed on the survey and household data for qPCR. Residence in the IRS arm was found to confer 64.7% reduced odds of infection with malaria compared with residence in the LLIN only arm, while residence in the MDA + IRS arm conferred an 80.1% reduction in the odds of being found infected. The additional protective impact of a single, co-timed round of MDA was detected via surveys performed (with one exception) more than 6 months after the MDA round. This shows that a single treatment round of antimalarials in a very high burden population, when combined with indoor spraying, can provide significant and prolonged protection from malaria infection. Limitations include non-random assignment to arm and the presence of only one cohort per arm",
