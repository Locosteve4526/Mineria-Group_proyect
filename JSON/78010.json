        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Silos are not good for our students. They distract from the large, complex landscape that our undergraduate students navigate. Silos are also inefficient, and in the face of severe budgetary constraints we must find new ways of working together across units. At institutions where silos are culturally and structurally embedded, how can we implement systems of networked student success that are designed to support our most vulnerable students? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;In this roundtable, the presenters show how they created networked student success at a decentralized university by implementing the \u201cCollective Impact\u201d framework. Collective Impact, as described by Kania and Kramer, provides a distinctive process that begins when isolated programs with similar missions and goals intentionally network their efforts. Participants will explore strategies for advancing their work through Collective Impact. &lt;/span&gt;",
