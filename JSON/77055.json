        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Glyphosate (GLY) is the active ingredient in most herbicides, including off-the-shelf weed killers such as Roundup\u00ae and Ranger Pro\u00ae. Reports have indicated that GLY crosses the blood-brain barrier, increases oxidative stress and genotoxicity, and potentially affects reproduction, but the extent of its health effects remain unclear. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; studies using human cell lines have found GLY to be uniquely capable of inducing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) compared to other herbicides and interferes with typical gene expression. Recently, a possible adaptive role for DSBs in learning and memory has been proposed. Neural stimulation &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; was shown to induce DSBs in promoter regions of immediate-early genes (IEGs), leading to up-regulation of their expression. IEGs are important for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory; dysregulation of DSBs and IEGs have both been implicated in the development of neurodegeneration, as well. However, a clear connection between GLY, DSBs, and learning and memory has yet to be made. Sex-specific sensitivity has also not been thoroughly described. Thus, we tested male and female wild-type mice in novel object recognition 24 h after they received an acute, oral dose of 0, 250, or 500 mg/kg of GLY. We hypothesized that a single dose of GLY would impair learning and memory by disrupting DSBs and IEG expression and would affect females more than males. We found that males, but not females, that received 250 mg/kg had impaired recognition memory, suggesting sex-specific sensitivity to GLY. Analysis of DSBs and IEGs in the hippocampus is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;",
