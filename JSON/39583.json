        "Description/Abstract": "Current voice detection systems involve speech enhancement algorithms and an advanced Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) circuit. In this work, a single memristor device is proposed to replace the complicated existing ADC circuitry in the  voice detection application. By applying a voice signal as an input, the memristor was used to generate a unique electrical fingerprint for each word. Characterizing the measured response is the first step towards the use of a memristor as a single element voice detector. \n",
