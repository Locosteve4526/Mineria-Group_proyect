        "Description/Abstract": "This chapter describes a university-wide initiative to develop multiple courses in both online and blended formats. The chapter provides perspectives of the project from three vantage points \u2013 administration, assessment, and teaching \u2013 and focuses on the blended courses. The administrational aspects of the project, such as how courses were selected and how faculty members were recruited, are briefly described. The assessment, which includes data on faculty and students perceptions as well as student performance and course success, is described in detail. Finally, a case study of a particularly successful course provides a detailed view of best practices for teaching in a blended environment.\n\n",
