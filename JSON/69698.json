        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The 2021 AACN &lt;em&gt;Essentials&lt;/em&gt; requires indirect and direct patient care experiences across&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the lifespan in four spheres of care, but the distinction between these experiences for&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;pre-licensure and post-licensure BSN students is unclear. Clarity regarding appropriate practice experiences which scaffold upon the previous learning of RN students while promoting professional development would be valuable information for RN faculty. The 2012 AACN White Paper, &lt;em&gt;Expectations for Practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experiences in the RN to Baccalaureate Curriculum&lt;/em&gt; describes innovative direct and&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;indirect care experiences and offers clarity to programs conducting curriculum revision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RN-Baccalaureate Faculty Forum (RNFF) recently identified a need for clarity and charged a task force with developing a position statement and providing examples of innovative practice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this presentation is to provide guidance for direct and indirect practice experiences for RN students, while reaffirming the 2012 &lt;em&gt;White Paper&lt;/em&gt; as an effective tool to provide clarity, standardization, and continued innovation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Exemplars of innovative RN student practice experiences which scaffold upon the previous&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;academic and work experience of students will be described in this presentation. This presentation will briefly share the work of the NRFF task force that is examining RN student practice experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These exemplars will fill a previous gap for RN educators by highlighting direct and indirect clinical experiences in the four spheres of care, in alignment with the 2012 &lt;em&gt;White Paper&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Limitations of RN practice experiences include: student resistance to clinical experiences, difficulty securing sites, and lack of attention to the 2012 &lt;em&gt;White Paper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Direct and indirect care experiences for RN students should scaffold on previous&lt;/p&gt;\nlearning in entry-level programs and be tailored to meet the the learning needs of this unique student population. Reaffirmation of the 2012 &lt;em&gt;White Paper&lt;/em&gt; and dissemination of examples of innovative practice experiences provides valuable guidance for RN program development.",
