        "Description/Abstract": "Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is fast becoming a losing battle. Human health is not the only concern, however. Meat and dairy industries are feeling financial, production, and ethical pressures to find alternatives to antibiotic use. Vaccines are a promising solution to this issue. S. aureus is a bacterium that causes bovine mastitis, an infection in the udders of cows. Our research focuses on utilizing highly conserved proteins in iron sequestering systems of S. aureus to create a vaccine. We hypothesize that antigenic proteins, such as IsdC, EsxA and FeoB will induce immunity to S. aureus. This will be accomplished by using a cholera toxin (CT) A2/B (CTA2/B) chimera adjuvant in concert with one or more antigenic proteins. With the toxic A2 subunit of CT removed, the A1/B subunit acts a carrier for the bacterial antigen of interest. The antigen attached to the A1 is \u201cpresented\u201d to the host immune system while the B subunit boosts the  immune response.    \n",
