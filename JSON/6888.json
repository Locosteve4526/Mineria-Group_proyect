        "Description/Abstract": "Residents across a state were asked about their opinions about a regional university. Using closed- and open-ended questions in mailed surveys, information about university image was collected. Results indicate that residents have one of two opinions about the university\u2014either they have a general, positive opinion (halo effect) or no opinion. LISREL modeling of the data point to the significant components of university image and how they influence the decision to send a son or daughter to the university, which in turn leads to a better understanding of the impact of university image. More work with varying populations and a variety of universities needs to be published to contribute to a general, overall understanding of the impact of university image.",
