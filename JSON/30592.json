        "Description/Abstract": "We study link theory in closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In this case homotopy classes of links can be represented by links\r\nembedded in tubular neighborhoods of a set of links de\fned by resolving singularities of unions of prime geodesics. Using\r\nthe hyperbolic metric we de\fne integral length invariants and other invariants, and study how these relate to oriented\r\nskein theory in the 3-manifold.",
