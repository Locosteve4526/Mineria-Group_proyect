        "Description/Abstract": "In Fall 2015, I was in working proposal stage with Boise State's Arts and Humanities Institute for Summer 2017.  Interdisciplinary exploration in which students and I will compare and contrast composition/design and creative processes between various disciplines in the arts and humanities (local visual and performing artists and composers, writers, chefs, architects, landscape designers, and more).
