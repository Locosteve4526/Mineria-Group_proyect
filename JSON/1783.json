        "Description/Abstract": "We combine sedimentological, hydraulic and geophysical information to  characterize the 3D distribution of transport properties of an  heterogeneous aquifer. We focus on the joint inversion of hydraulic head  and self-potential measurements collected during an extensive  experimental campaign performed at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research  Site (BHRS), Boise, Idaho, and involving a series of dipole tests. While  hydraulic head data obtained from piezometric readings in open wells  represent a depth-averaged value, self-potential signals provide an  estimate of the water table location. The aquifer is conceptualized as a  multiple-continuum, where the volumetric fraction of a geo-material  within a cell of the numerical flow model is calculated by Multiple  Indicator Kriging. The latter is implemented on the basis of available  sedimentological information. The functional format of the indicator  variograms and associated parameters are estimated on the basis of  formal model identification criteria. Self-potential and hydraulic head  data have been embedded jointly within a three-dimensional inverse model  of groundwater flow at the site. Each identified geo-material  (category) is assumed to be characterized by a constant hydraulic  conductivity. The latter constitute the set of model parameters. The  hydraulic conductivity associated with a numerical block is then  calculated as a weighted average of the conductivities of the  geo-materials which are collocated in the block by means of Multiple  Indicator Kriging. Model parameters are estimated by a Maximum  Likelihood fit between measured and modeled state variables, resulting  in a spatially heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity. The  latter is effectively constrained on the sedimentological data and  conditioned on both self-potential and borehole hydraulic head readings.  Minimization of the Maximum Likelihood objective function allows  estimating the relative weight of measurement errors associated with  self-potential and borehole-based head data. The procedure adopted  allowed a reconstruction of the heterogeneity of the site with a level  of details, which was not obtained in previous studies and with  relatively modest computational efforts. Further validation against  dipole tests which were not used in the inversion procedure supports the  robustness of the results.",
