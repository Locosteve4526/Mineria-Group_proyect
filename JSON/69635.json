        "Description/Abstract": "Phenomenology is the study of experience as it is concretely lived, a study that works to develop general structures or interpretations from this concrete particularity. Pedagogy, on the other hand, can be delineated through the \u201cpedagogical difference\u201d that separates the experience of the educator from the experience of those being educated. Phenomenology and pedagogy converge not just in their interest in particular experiences on either side of this divide; both imply a position or an \u201cattitude\u201d from which everyday pedagogical experience can be understood. Phenomenology is a philosophical tradition and an approach to qualitative research that has been adapted to the study of lived experience in fields as diverse as psychology, psychiatry and sociology. In both philosophy and qualitative research, phenomenology is seen as embodying a method with multiple stages or facets, known collectively as the reduction, bracketing or epoch\u00e9. Today phenomenology designates an active and varied international field of research and theory, one that continues to address urgent issues and concerns in education and in a wide variety of other domains.",
