It cites possible outcomes of an annual performance evaluation including assignment of desirable courses, computation of merit pay raises, and a record of one's teaching accomplishments. Guidelines for using the appraisal form which offered instructions for developing a self-report in each category are offered. The author stresses the need to develop evaluation procedures in response to very local conditions.",
