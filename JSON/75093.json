        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;During the 2023-2024 AY, Boise State University Assistant Vice President of Research Jana LaRosa and Interdisciplinary Studies Graduate Program Director Dr. Nicole Molumby hosted multiple faculty focus groups and identified design-thinking experts on campus to assist in developing a workshop series that will target newly appointed associate faculty across campus as they begin to envision their next phase of research and creative activity. The goal of the workshop will be to introduce faculty to a new approach through a user centered tool set and structure that invests in relationships and professional development with faculty peers across the university. It is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;at this interesting juncture in their career&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;, we strengthen their potential to swivel, expand, and ultimately converge on new ideas and solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;As newly tenured faculty, participants will now have the freedom to focus on outward looking opportunities that can further their reach of influence in research and creative activity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;To support interdisciplinary teaching, research and development, we would like to apply evidence-based,\u00a0 design-thinking methodology for diverse participants to enable convergent growth in problem identification and solving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;We will use design thinking protocols that focus on use-inspired or human centered design within a cohort of interdisciplinary faculty participants to envision next steps forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;This \u201cunsession\u201d will be designed for AIS membership to share their own collaborative strategies and structures that support and engage faculty in innovative convergent research. As non-experts in design-thinking practices, our purpose for this \u201cunsession\u201d is to learn from others, gain ideas and information to continue developing the Think Big! Workshop at Boise State, and together reimagine research methodologies through a user-centered approach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;To support this session Molumby and LaRosa will:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Provide an overview of the Think Big! Workshop where we briefly discuss where we are at in this process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Share our working bibliography of current DT literature focused on research methodology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Share a summary of the data collected during the focus group discussions at Boise State in spring 2024\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Lead a discussion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; four questions that we hope will inform our work and support others in doing this at their institutions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;What are the potential applications of design thinking in higher education research?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;How can design thinking methodologies be applied to traditional research?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;What tools, techniques and methods characterize user centered research?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;How might universities develop faculty to pivot and re-envision their research using design-thinking methodologies?\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;",
