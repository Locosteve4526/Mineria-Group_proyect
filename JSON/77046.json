The artist wove deathshrouds for some of the many deceasedwomen whose remains are found in thewestern landscape. Lee researches the publicrecord for each case and visits the site whereeach woman was found, taking a picture ofthe shroud laid in place. Each of the elevenshrouds in the exhibit is accompanied by aphoto of place and some information aboutwhat is known of the woman for whom theshroud is made. \u201cEach shroud,\u201d writes Lee,\u201cincorporates information about the women into the structure of its pattern.\u201d To those whostand and engage with the photographs, and the shrouds in this corner, the reward is a senseof the lonesome tragedy of each death, blended with admiration for the sympathetic andpoetic way in which the artist pays homage to these individual women.&quot;",
