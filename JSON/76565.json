I'll share some practical notes on the organization and structure of our Campus Conversations in the 2023\u201324 academic year, including successes and some lessons learned from the process. I'll also include feedback from conversation participants about their experience that shows the promise of this approach. For those looking to increase the sense of campus community and the felt freedom\u2014even among a naysayer or two!\u2014to converse across differences, our approach may provide a helpful model.",
