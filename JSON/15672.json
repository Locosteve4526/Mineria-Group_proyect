        "Description/Abstract": " I will begin by describing recent efforts of the Consortium for Mathematics in the Geosciences (CMG++) formed by members of the mathematical, statistical, computational and geoscience communities. The goal of the consortium is to accelerate traditional interactions between these groups of scientists. Then I will discuss a computational inverse method developed by myself and colleagues that was motivated by specific challenges in oceanographic data assimilation and geophysics.",
