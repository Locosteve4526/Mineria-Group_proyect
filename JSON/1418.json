        "Description/Abstract": "When libraries first started experimenting with web tools, it was a challenging experience because it required highly specialized skills and the assistance of expensive programmers. The last several years have seen an explosion of free and user-friendly web tools, many of which suit our needs perfectly. Even better, many of them require nothing other than a willingness to experiment and have some fun. This article describes some of our favorites and how they might be useful for libraries.",
