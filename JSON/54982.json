        "Description/Abstract": "In this paper, we share our approach and the process for qualitative analysis of online video data recorded during an after-school robotics program that emphasized computational thinking (CT). Online research strategies may be necessary for various reasons such as when working with a geographically distributed research team, when conducting research with students in an online program, or when resources are inaccessible due to campus closures like those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We followed a three-stage process during qualitative analysis of the videos that included planning and setup, online analysis of videos, and structural coding of memos to explore patterns across the data. Analysis was conducted with a combination of technologies including Google Drive for collaborative coding online and NVivo to collate and summarize findings. The methods and process we describe are readily applicable to other research studies that include video as part of the data set.",
