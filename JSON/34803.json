        "Description/Abstract": "Steroidal alkaloids are found in plants of the genus Veratrum.\nTheir toxicity manifests as gastrointestinal symptoms followed by a Bezold-\nJarisch reflex: hypopnea, hypotension and bradycardia. Some Veratrum\nsteroidal alkaloids are also teratogens interfering with the hedgehog-2\nsignaling pathway, which causes cyclopsia and holoprosencephaly. We\npresent a case of accidental poisoning from V. parviflorum mistaken for the\nedible Allium tricoccum (ramps, wild leek). Case history: A 27 year old man\nand his 25 year old wife presented to the emergency department with\nnausea, vomiting, hypotension, and bradycardia after foraging and\ningesting plants that they believed to be a local native species of wild leek.\nMethods: We collected and analyzed the implicated fresh plant material\nand both patients\u2019 serum/plasma. We used liquid chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray ionization time of flight\ntandem mass spectrometry to extract and characterize steroidal alkaloids\nfrom the foraged plant and patients\u2019 serum. Results: Our V. parviflorum\nsamples contained verazine, veratramine, veratridine, and cyclopamine.\nDiscussion: Steroidal alkaloids have been previously isolated from V. viride\nand V. album and toxicity has been reported mainly from V. album species.\nThis is the first reported case of Veratrum toxicity from V. parviflorum with\nidentified steroidal alkaloids. Conclusion: V. parviflorum toxicity manifests\nwith gastrointestinal and cardiac symptoms. Treatment is symptomatic and\nsupportive as with previous case reports of toxicity with other Veratrum\nspecies.",
