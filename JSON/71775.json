        "Description/Abstract": "Introduction Longitudinal effect of diet-induced obesity on bone is uncertain. Prior work showed both no effect versus a decrement in bone density or quality when obesity begins prior to skeletal maturity. We aimed to quantify long-term effects of obesity on bone and bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in adulthood. Methods Skeletally mature, female C57BL/6 mice (n=70) aged 12-weeks were randomly allocated to low-fat (LFD; 10%kcal fat; n=30) or high-fat (HFD; 60%kcal fat; n=30) diet, with analyses at 12,15,18 and 24-weeks (n=10/group). Tibial microarchitecture was analyzed by \u00b5CT, and volumetric BMAT was quantified via 9.4T MRI/advanced-image-analysis. Histomorphometry of adipocytes and osteoclasts, and qPCR were performed. Results Body weight and visceral white adipose tissue accumulated in response to HFD started in adulthood. Trabecular bone parameters declined with advancing experimental age. BV/TV declined 22% in LFD (p=0.0001) and 17% in HFD (p=0.0022) by 24-weeks. HFD failed to appreciably alter BV/TV and had negligible impact on other microarchitecture parameters. Both dietary intervention and age accounted for variance in BMAT, with regional differences: distal femoral BMAT was more responsive to diet, while proximal femoral BMAT was more attenuated by age. BMAT increased 60% in the distal metaphysis in HFD at 18 and 24 weeks (p=0.0011). BMAT in the proximal femoral diaphysis, unchanged by diet, decreased 45% due to age (p=0.0002). Marrow adipocyte size via histomorphometry supported MRI quantification. Osteoclast number did not differ between groups. Tibial qPCR showed attenuation of some adipose, metabolism, and bone genes. A regulator of fatty-acid \u03b2-oxidation, Cytochrome C (CYCS), was 500% more abundant in HFD-bone (p&lt;0.0001; diet effect). CYCS also increased due to age, but to a lesser extent. HFD mildly increased OCN, TRAP, and SOST. Conclusions Long-term high fat feeding after skeletal maturity, despite upregulation of visceral adiposity, body weight, and BMAT, failed to attenuate bone microarchitecture. In adulthood, we found aging to be a more potent regulator of microarchitecture than diet-induced obesity.",
