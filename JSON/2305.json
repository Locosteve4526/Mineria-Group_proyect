        "Description/Abstract": "Researchers have often investigated introductory physics students\u2019 understanding of gravity through the Newtonian \u201caction-at-a-distance\u201d model of gravitational force. This study further explores students\u2019 understanding by including the rubber sheet analogy as a physical model for Einstein\u2019s theory of gravitational fields associated with the curvature of space-time. The research data, which includes measures of N = 101 general education university students\u2019 pre- and post-instruction performance on a Gravity Concept Inventory, indicates instruction on the rubber sheet analogy can be moderately successful at reducing the prevalence of students\u2019 misconceptions about gravity, including students\u2019 beliefs that atmosphere, rotation, and magnetism affect gravity.  Results suggest typical normalized gains among students were approximately 40%, moderated by potentially educationally significant differences associated with the age and sex of students.",
