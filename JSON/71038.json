        "Description/Abstract": "Changes in soil stratigraphic-plane orientation, whether natural or artificial, show variations in hydraulic conductivity with measurement direction (Peng, 2011). Hydraulic conductivity must, hence, be considered, in this case, as a nondiagonal, full tensor to appropriately represent the effect of the orientation of soil stratigraphic planes on the seepage flow pattern. This paper introduces the derivation of the formula for the three-dimensional (3D) nondiagonal hydraulic conductivity full tensor calculation in terms of azimuth and vertical angles. Furthermore, 2D numerical simulations of the seepage flow beneath a concrete dam are presented to demonstrate the need to account for the nondiagonal elements of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in anisotropic soils of varying degrees of stratigraphic tilt with respect to the coordinate system.",
