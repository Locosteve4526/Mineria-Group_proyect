        "Description/Abstract": "Background\r\nMetacognition is thinking that enables understanding, analysis, and regulation of one\u2019s cognition when engaged in learning. Metacognitive skills and self-regulated learning are foundational to the development of clinical reasoning and self-reflective practice. \r\nMethods\r\nThis pilot qualitative study utilized observation and interview to identify metacognitive strategies utilized by a convenience sample of nursing students during simulation and debriefing. Metacognitive taxonomies were used to code the observations and interviews. \r\nResults \r\nStudents did participate is some types of metacognitive strategies in simulation and debriefing, but in both observation and interview students did not participate in the complete metacognitive trajectory. \r\nConclusion\r\nSimulation design lends itself to introduction of metacognitive strategies. Students would benefit from these strategies implemented throughout pre-briefing, simulation and debriefing. Further research is needed concerning strategies to increase metacognition in simulation and debriefing and if prior student training in metacognitive skills affect simulation and debriefing learning outcomes. \r\n\r\n",
