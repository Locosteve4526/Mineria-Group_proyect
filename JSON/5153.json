        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention (a women's book club; Women Bound to be Active) in promoting long-term physical activity (PA). Thirty-five women (26-70 years; mean age 50.6 years) completed the 8-month intervention and participated in the one-year follow-up. At follow-up, PA returned to baseline levels; however, self-worth and body mass index significantly improved. Women were more knowledgeable about PA at follow-up; however, they failed to maintain PA after the intervention. Components of the intervention were effective in improving self-worth and lowering BMI at one-year follow-up. To enhance long-term PA adherence continued research and intervention modifications are needed.",
