        "Description/Abstract": "This paper address the multiethnic and contested nature of borderlands, realms where the mixing of populations and cultures have occurred, such as the Inn.  The Inn has been a zone of peaceful coexistence and brutalizing violence. At the same time, it is a place of national indifference and identity-formation. The Inn was the center of the shtetl, and it  inspired outstanding literary works and other cultural products, both national and transnational. But what was the role of the Innkeeper's wife at the center of that Inn?",
