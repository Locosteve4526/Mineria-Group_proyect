        "Description/Abstract": "Corpus linguistics has fundamentally changed our understanding of language use, and this, in turn, has led to changes in how we approach language education.  A number of language teaching resources are now corpus-informed, and recent empirical studies suggest that students benefit from engagement with corpus-based methods of language analysis.  This article provides an introduction to key concepts in corpus linguistics that have particular relevance to classroom instruction, including word frequency lists, collocation and phraseology, register variation, and data-driven learning.",
