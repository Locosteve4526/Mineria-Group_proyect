        "Description/Abstract": "Solar heat radiation can impose significant heat loading on persons performing outdoor work in desert environments. This exposure can increase the risk for heat exhaustion or heat stroke. A prototype infrared reflecting vest was developed that offers protection against exposure to high levels of infrared radiation. The performance of the prototype vest was evaluated using a laboratory based thermal manikin exposed to controlled heat radiation intensity levels. The results showed that the vest can reduce body heat gain by 54% without imposing a significant insulation heat gain. With the use of such a vest, thermal discomfort can be reduced and worker productivity increased. Commercial development of such a technology for use in outdoor environments is proposed.",
