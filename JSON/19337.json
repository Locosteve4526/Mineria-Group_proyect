        "Description/Abstract": "People living with HIV and AIDS and their families often experience multiple and repetitive losses and grief.  There are physical, social and economic consequences of AIDS-related losses.  The unique characteristics of AIDS-related bereavement make the coping very challenging.  Development of interventions is needed to assist people to cope with AIDS-related bereavement.  Although support groups have been utilized by a variety of professionals and organizations to help people cope with losses and bereavement, there is a gap in existing studies regarding the effectiveness of support groups for AIDS-bereaved people.
