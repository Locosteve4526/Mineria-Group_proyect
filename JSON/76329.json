        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Our team conducted a literature review to present to The East Boise Community Reentry Center (EBCRC) in hopes of discovering common patterns to be seen within females that contributed to involvement with the judicial system. We looked at common intervention points, common offenses for females, and best practices within other programs or organizations. The research approach consisted of gathering relevant articles from several databases and government websites that are tailored to research intervention points. Our findings concluded that socioeconomic factors, drug and alcohol exposure, and family dynamics all contribute to women\u2019s incarceration. We believe that the best practices for programs looking to implement successful intervention points consist of collaboration with existing community intervention programs, speaking with local government officials about the importance of continued funding for these programs, and developing and implementing a mentor program with the juvenile justice system.&lt;/p&gt;",
