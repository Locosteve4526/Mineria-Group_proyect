When asked if her novel &quot;Rosalie l'Inf\u00e2me&quot; could be seen as a detective story, Trouillot answers that she has always been a passionate reader of this literary genre. Trouillot explains that the main character in her novel, Lisette, was inspired by  the young girls that she could observe in real life, like her daughters  or her nieces.",
