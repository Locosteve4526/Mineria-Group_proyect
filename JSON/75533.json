        "Description/Abstract": "Modified sports offer a strategic approach to promoting health in older adults. Light&lt;br&gt;volleyball, which uses a larger, lighter ball than traditional volleyball, is more accessible&lt;br&gt;for this population. This study investigated the effects of a 16-week light volleyball&lt;br&gt;program on the functional fitness of older adults in Hong Kong. A total of 275 participants&lt;br&gt;aged 60 years or older were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: a light&lt;br&gt;volleyball intervention group, a Tai Chi group, and a control group. Functional fitness was&lt;br&gt;assessed at the pretest, posttest, and 6-month follow-up. Results revealed that the light&lt;br&gt;volleyball group exhibited more significant improvements in lower and upper limb&lt;br&gt;strength, agility, dynamic balance, and aerobic endurance than did the Tai Chi and control&lt;br&gt;groups. This study highlights the effectiveness of light volleyball as a newly emerging,&lt;br&gt;group-based sport physical activity for promoting healthy aging in older adult women. The&lt;br&gt;use of light volleyball in future health promotion initiatives is highly recommended.",
