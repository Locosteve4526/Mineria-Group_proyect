        "Description/Abstract": "Salmonellosis is the most common bacterial foodborne illness in the U.S. Non-typhoidal strains of Salmonella can infect humans and animals to cause acute gastroenteritis. Bovines can also harbor sub-clinical infection and are a main reservoir for humans. Despite licensed Salmonella vaccines for bovines, the incidence of disease has not declined, and an improved vaccine would have a significant impact. Bacterial AB5 toxins are key virulence factors and important antigens in licensed vaccines. S. Typhimurium phage-type DT014 harbors a novel AB5-type toxin, ArtAB. The goal of this study is to determine the role of ArtAB in the context of bovine disease and as a potential Salmonella vaccine. \n\u00a0\nPCR analysis of 90 bovine S. Typhimurium type B identified 13 with artAB (14%). The artAB sequence was highly conserved among these isolates. artAB expression in vitro was confirmed by purification of toxin and qRT-PCR from bovine S. Typhimurium. artAB was previously cloned into E.coli and it was determined that ArtAB has affinity for fetuin and D-galactose. Cytotoxicity assays with ArtAB on epithelial cells indicated a slow cytotoxic response at high concentrations after more than 18 hours. Confocal microscopy revealed internalization of E.coli purified ArtAB-HIS into Vero cells. Lastly, we compared the binding affinity of ArtAB and cholera toxin (CT) to fetuin and D-galactose by ELISA and isothermal calorimetry (ITC). \n\u00a0\nFindings indicate that artAB is present in bovine S. Typhimurium, but at a low percentage, and is expressed in vitro from positive isolates. Active toxin with binding affinity to D-galactose and fetuin can be purified at high concentrations from E. coli and traffics into tissue culture in vitro. \n\u00a0\nIn future studies we will identify the expression and activity of ArtAB\u00a0in vivo as well as define toxin structure. Findings will determine the contributions of ArtAB to toxicity and virulence in bovines, and represent steps to a mucosal Salmonella bovine\u00a0vaccine that will\u00a0utilize\u00a0the antigen and potential adjuvant activity of ArtAB.\u00a0\n",
