        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Empathizing with others without a shared experience can be difficult for students. The lack of personal experience can be addressed by implementing extended reality (XR) and virtual reality (VR) techniques in criminal justice classrooms (e.g., Smith, 2021). In this study, we utilize the Empathy Lens, a 360-degree immersive video through which the participants can experience the thoughts and feelings of another individual. More specifically, the study explores the impact of XR on student empathy and opinions about a police-citizen encounter. The study uses multiple course sections of an undergraduate policing course at a large western university. As a part of the course, students participated in a series of Empathy Lens scenarios through virtual reality headsets. Students viewed a police-citizen encounter from the perspectives of a police officer and a detained civilian. They also considered a recording of the situation filmed by a bystander. The students' reflection assignments that they completed after the viewings served as the qualitative data source. Our findings demonstrate the XR technology's ability to challenge students to consider multiple perspectives and their sense of empathy in high-stress situations. Practical recommendations, limitations, and suggestions for future directions in criminal justice pedagogy are discussed.&lt;/span&gt;",
