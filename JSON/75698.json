Delivering mental healthcare using artificial intelligence chatbots may be one option for closing the gaps in mental healthcare access. The overall aim of this scoping review was to describe the use, efficacy, and advantages/disadvantages of using an artificial intelligence chatbot for mental healthcare (stress, anxiety, depression).",
