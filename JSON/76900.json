        "Description/Abstract": "While election forecasting has arrived in some two dozen electoral democracies, hardly any effort has been made to forecast Israeli elections, due to several challenges. I discuss those challenges and offer a &quot;reward-and-punishment&quot; theory of the voting behavior of Israelis. I formalize the theory into a small model of election forecasting for Israeli elections using unemployment and incumbent approval approximately three months prior to the election and estimate the model using Israeli elections and voting intention data from 1973-2021. My forecast for the 2022 elections, given the sparseness of the model, was relatively accurate.",
