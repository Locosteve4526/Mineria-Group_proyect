        "Description/Abstract": "This study and presentation will focus on the strengths and positive outcomes of the Rural Endorsement Development Opportunities (REDO) program. REDO is an online professional development program at Boise State University that is making a positive impact for educators and addresses the continued demand to increase the statewide pool of highly qualified, culturally responsive teachers in Idaho, USA, and the need to increase the achievement of English learners (ELs) by promoting literacy at home and at school. The objective of this program is to provide beneficial professional development specific to the local needs of English learners in a rural population that permits expedient access to upgrade the state English as a Second Language or Bilingual endorsement. Examples will be shared from this online program that have been carefully designed to expand learning.",
