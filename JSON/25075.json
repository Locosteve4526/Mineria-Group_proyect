        "Description/Abstract": "For purposes of this chapter, we accept Vrij's (2000) definition of deception as &quot;a successful or unsuccessful deliberate attempt, without forewarning, to create in another a belief which the communicator considers to be untrue&quot; (p.6). Deception is a ubiquitous human behavior.  DePaulo and her colleagues (DePaulo &amp; Kashy, 1998; DePaulo, Kashy, Kirkendol, Wyer, &amp; Epstein, 1996; Kashy &amp; Depaulo, 1996) studied deception in naturalistic settings and found that during interpersonal interactions of 10 minutes or longer, people lied on average twice a day.  Deception is used in quarter of interactions with others, and on average, a person lies to 34% of the people interacted with during an average week.  Robinson, Shepherd, and Heywood (1998) reported that 83% of the university undergraduates surveyed said they would like to get a job.",
