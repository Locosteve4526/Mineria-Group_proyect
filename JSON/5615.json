        "Description/Abstract": "Purpose:  This paper describes the development and validation of the theoretically-grounded Emergency Medical Services Role Identity Scale (EMS-RIS) that measures four domains of EMS role identity.  \r\nMethod: The EMS-RIS was developed using a mixed methods approach.  Key informants informed item development and the scale was validated using a representative probability sample of EMTs and paramedics.  Factor structure, convergent and discriminant validity were examined. \r\nResults: The survey attained a 22% usable response rate (N=207).  Factor analyses revealed a conceptually consistent, four-factor solution with sound psychometric properties. \r\nDiscussion: Social workers work collaboratively with EMS professionals in crisis settings and as their counselors when they are distressed.  The EMS-RIS provides useful information for the assessment of distressed EMS professionals, and a springboard for future research of how role identity may influence occupational stress.  Ultimately, understanding and improving the quality of EMS responders\u2019 practice can result in improved outcomes for their patients.\r\n",
