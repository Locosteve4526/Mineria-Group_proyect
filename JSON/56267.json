        "Description/Abstract": "COVID-19 has forced educators to redesign courses for different delivery modalities. While this originally caused chaos for many faculty members, the continued need for flexibility has provided an opportunity to rethink how courses could best support students both during the pandemic and moving forward. A pre-licensure first semester fundamentals of nursing course changed from fully in-person to hybrid delivery. Adaptations were made with a focus on concepts of growth mindset and creating a supportive environment to foster early acquisition of reflection skills. Many of these adaptations can continue to be incorporated into a fundamental of nursing courses beyond the COVID-19 crisis.",
