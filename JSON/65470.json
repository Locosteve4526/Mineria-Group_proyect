        "Description/Abstract": "This collaborative self-study of teacher educators\u2019 feedback practices argues for\nan intentional process for teacher educators to develop an inquiry stance toward\nour own teaching. Data sources include formative observation forms, evaluations,\nobservation notes, debriefings, surveys, researcher journals, and layered memos.\nFindings define influences and shared patterns of practice. Our professional\nlearning from this self-study built our capacity as teacher educators by informing\nour development of an inquiry feedback cycle rooted in representations,\napproximations, and decomposition of practice (Grossman et al., 2009) to\nintentionally model and scaffold the development of an inquiry stance toward\npractice in our teacher candidates.",
