        "Description/Abstract": "The phase transitions of superlattices into single- and multidomain states were studied using a mesoscale phase-field model incorporating structural inhomogeneity, micromechanics, and electrostatics. While the predictions of transition temperatures of BaTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices into multidomains show remarkably good, quantitative agreement with ultraviolet Raman spectroscopic and variable-temperature x-ray diffraction measurements, the single-domain assumption breaks down for superlattices in which the nonferroelectric layer thickness exceeds the characteristic domain size in the ferroelectric layers.",
