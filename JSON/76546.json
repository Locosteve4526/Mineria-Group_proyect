        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;This Article details what is happening in the West as the region hurtles toward a new electricity structure. Drawing on interviews with dozens of stakeholders, real-time observation of many discussions around market formation, and analysis of expert studies, white papers, legislation, and other relevant materials, the Article first puts the West\u2019s current developments in historical context, from restructuring in the 1990s to failed efforts to regionalize in the 2000s to the pivotal development of a real-time market in 2014. It then chronicles the state of the West today, providing a roadmap of the players, proposals, and policies in question. Finally, it identifies and evaluates the possible paths forward for a region certain to undergo significant change.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;",
