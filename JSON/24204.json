        "Description/Abstract": "The fourth book in Stephanie Meyer's popular Twilight series, Breaking Dawn, is a resurrection story that bridges contemporary human relationships and conventional religious principles. This chapter examines how the lead character, Bella, personifies the ideal Mormon female. The ongoing discussion of how the books might influence girls and young women is reviewed, before comparing the story lines of Breaking Dawn with LDS doctrine. Social implications for young women are then discussed.",
