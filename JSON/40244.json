        "Description/Abstract": "Transcription is discontinuous, resulting in RNA bursting. Transcription factors (TFs) involved in transcription regulation, are transiently associated with genomic targets and it is unclear how they regulate bursting. Many physiological signals, including glucocorticoid hormones, are pulsatile but their effects on bursting are unknown. Here, we analyze fluorescently labeled RNA synthesis from single copy glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated MMTV transcription sites (TSs) under pulsed (ultradian) and constant hormone stimulation and find that the former induces restricted bursting, centered around hormonal pulse. Moreover, we demonstrate that TF nuclear mobility determines burst duration and the bound fraction determines burst frequency. Using 3D tracking of TSs, we directly correlate TF binding and RNA synthesis at the single promoter level. Finally, we uncover a striking co-bursting pattern between proximal and distal TSs. Together, our data reveal a dynamic interplay between TF mobility and RNA bursting that is responsive to stimuli strength, type, modality, and duration.\n\n",
