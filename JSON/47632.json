        "Description/Abstract": "We developped a lab set that can measure both electrical and hydraulic conductivity of soils. Preliminary results show that the lab setup with our test procedures can measure soil complex electrical conductivity and hydraulic conductivity. Both measurements are repeatable. The setup can be used to study the electrical-hydraulic relationships of soil/regolith in the Critical Zone.  Some revisions to the setup are suggested, including replacing manometer with pressure transducer and using peristaltic pump to apply hydraulic gradient.\n",
