        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is (1) to provide a framework for the knowledge needed by mathematics professional developers, and (2) to describe our model of identifying and preparing over 24 facilitators for a statewide, mandated mathematics professional development course \u2013 Mathematical Thinking for Instruction (MTI). MTI course participants\u2019 knowledge was measured before and after the course using items from the Learning Mathematics for Teaching project (Learning Mathematics For Teaching, 2005). For over 2600 participants across three grade-level bands (K-3, 4-8, and 6-12), growth on the knowledge inventory was relatively consistent across instructors and course sections. This consistency provides evidence for the efficacy of our apprenticeship-based facilitator preparation model. In addition, our knowledge framework provides a mechanism to foster an important conversation in the research literature about the types and areas of knowledge necessary for high-quality professional development facilitation.",
