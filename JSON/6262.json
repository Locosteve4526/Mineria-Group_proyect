It was found that P &gt; V subjects were overrepresented and V &gt; P subjects were underrepresented in our sample compared with expectations derived from a normative sample. It was also found that intellectual imbalance, regardless of direction, was significantly related to delinquency involvement. This finding held when controlling for social class and race.",
