        "Description/Abstract": "A national sample of psychology instructors (N = 134) rated the appropriateness and frequency of 104 potential student behaviors, replicating and extending Parr and Valerius. The top 10 ratings for appropriateness and frequency differed from previous work. The author discusses the importance of clear communication of instructor expectations of student behavior in addition to course expectations as presented in the syllabus. Instructors may wish to use this list to help inform students of appropriate and inappropriate behaviors as well as to encourage students to increase the frequency of appropriate behaviors.",
