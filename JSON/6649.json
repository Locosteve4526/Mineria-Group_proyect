        "Description/Abstract": "Parabolic differential\u2013functional equations with initial-boundary conditions of Dirichlet type are studied. Spatial derivatives occurring in the original problem are replaced by suitable differences and the problem is transformed into an initial-boundary value problem for a system of ordinary differential\u2013functional equations. The Pen-on-type estimation for the right-hand side of the original equation with respect to the functional argument is assumed. The convergence of the numerical method of lines is proved. The differential inequalities technique is applied. ",
