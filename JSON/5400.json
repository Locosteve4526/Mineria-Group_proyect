        "Description/Abstract": "Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF) is used to measure  the size distributions of humic acids in solution. Shifts in the size  distribution are used to study the behavior of these amphiphilic  macromolecules in solution with changes in pH, ionic strength, and humic  acid concentration. Humic acid concentrations are increased by  on-channel focusing of the injected samples. As the concentration is  increased, the humic acids aggregate, but the effect varies with  solution conditions. As the concentration of calcium chloride is  increased, size distributions broaden and become multimodal. The  decrease in size is consistent with reports that divalent cations induce  conformational changes by the formation of intramolecular bridges  between carboxylate moieties; multimodality indicates intermolecular  interactions as well. Lowering the pH also promotes intermolecular  interactions, with severe aggregation occurring below pH 4. The work  demonstrates the utility of AsFlFFF in studies of the hydrodynamic  behavior of amphiphilic macromolecules. \u00a9 1997 John Wiley &amp; Sons,  Inc. J Micro Sep9: 535\u2013543, 1997",
