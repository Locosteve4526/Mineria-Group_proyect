        "Description/Abstract": "Conventional wisdom doesn't always apply\u2014especially when determining how to narrow the gender gap in reading. On the surface, it would seem that the challenge of motivating boys to read in school could be solved by finding texts that appeal to boys. Our research, however, suggests that such efforts are misguided, in part because it's just too difficult to make sweeping generalizations about what it is that boys like to read.\nIndeed, our research indicates that there are no simple answers. Our survey of 49 boys from four different schools in three different eastern states revealed that if boys don't like to read in school it's for several reasons:\n\nThey didn't feel competent in the activity. \nThey perceived that the text they were to read was beyond their abilities. \nThey didn't understand the purpose for reading. \nThey didn't perceive their reading to be immediately useful or enjoyable. \nThey didn't see how the reading material had social significance.",
