        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Denise Levertov\u2019s performance of ballet as a youth left a mark on her poetry. Ezra Pound defined logopoeia as the \u201cdance of the intellect among words,\u201d and she attests to the significance of dance to her creative imagination. William Carlos Williams proved an even greater influence on Levertov than Pound, and he also emphasized the importance of the dance of the imagination. In &lt;em&gt;Spring and All&lt;/em&gt;, the imagination engenders a kind of dance \u201cwhich is not a mirror up to nature but\u201d a kind of flight that affirms and celebrates the world. Similarly, in the fourteenth improvisation of &lt;em&gt;Kora in Hell&lt;/em&gt;, he declares, \u201c&lt;em&gt;Out of bitterness itself the clear wine of the imagination will be pressed and the dance prosper thereby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps inspired by Williams as well as her own experience, Levertov refers to dance as a form of imaginative abandon in some key early poems. She refers to dancing to dramatize keens acts of perception, depicting animals and humans alike engaged in their most characteristic actions, and dance often expresses a form of creative intensity. In &lt;em&gt;Here and Now&lt;/em&gt;, for example, the waterwoman contrasts with the sleeping earthwoman when she \u201cgoes dancing in the lit-up town / in dragonfly dresses and blue shoes\u201d (&lt;em&gt;Collected Poems&lt;/em&gt; 45), while a cat playing with a mouse is \u201can angel / dancing with its prey\u201d (&lt;em&gt;Collected Poems&lt;/em&gt; 44). Similarly, in \u201cOverland to the Islands,\u201d Levertov focuses on the animal energy of a dog, who embodies the ideal she seeks for in her poetry. Like the dog, she aims to be alert to \u201cperceptions\u2014dancing / edgeways\u201d and disdaining \u201cnothing.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;",
