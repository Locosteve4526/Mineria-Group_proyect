        "Description/Abstract": "One of the common denominators in the etchings of De Bry\u2019s multi-volume America is corporal violence, whether it depicts the Spanish cruelties inflicted upon Native Americans, or the cannibalism and sacrifices conducted by Amerindians. Not surprisingly, the Protestant French, English, and German (whose explorations and colonial desires De Bry\u2019s edition promotes) appear to be free of extreme violent behavior in text and image. By limiting corporal violence to the American \u201csavages\u201d and the Spanish conquistadors, De Bry creates a visual equation of the beastly Indian with the savage Catholic. ",
