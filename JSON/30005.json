        "Description/Abstract": "The article offers ways on how teachers can create a print-rich pre-school environment to help children improve their literacy skills. It mentions that teachers can share books to children for them to become motivated in learning. It also suggests the need to provide writing materials that encourage children's language development and self-expression. Furthermore, teachers can conduct a dramatic play to allow children to take on roles and express their ideas.",
