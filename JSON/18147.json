We see high levels of commitment from both a mentor and a mentee to be necessary for sustainable mentoring programs. Infusing a discussion of commitment to mentoring relationships with a relational approach, we propose Reeder\u2019s (2014) elements of commitment can be used to design and implement institutional policies capable of enhancing and supporting mentoring relationships over time.",
