        "Description/Abstract": "Hegemonic narratives and practices around environmental\nchange, even when coming from concerned and seemingly\nprogressive fronts, often contribute to a larger project of\npopulation control. The Malthusian specter of overpopulation looms large in pervasive images of imminent ecological disaster in ways that are profoundly depoliticizing\nand that serve projects of militarization, misogyny, and\nracism. In this paper, we expose and challenge problematic\ndiscourses of neo-Malthusian environmental change, paying\nparticular attention to discourses surrounding climate\nchange. Aiming to bring history, geography and politics\nback into public debate on environmental change, we\nargue for the destabilization of neo-Malthusianism and see\nthis as key to building a (feminist) political ecology of climate change.",
