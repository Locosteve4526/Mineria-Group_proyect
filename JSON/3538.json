        "Description/Abstract": "Following cognitive load theory, we used a computer-based software training paradigm to determining the optimal number of steps or information chunks to present before practice opportunities. Results demonstrating that the size of information chunks presented and the type of practice used individually influenced participants' ability to effectively learn via computer-based instruction. These findings contribute to the literature by showing the importance of practice and optimal segment sizes for learning via a computer.",
