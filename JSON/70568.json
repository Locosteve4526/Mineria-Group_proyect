        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In this edited collection, we examine commonplaces of GTA training and experiences through an inclusive range of genres designed to be usable and provocative for readers of this collection, such as narratives, researched studies, creative plans, or manifestos. Many first-year writing and GTA mentoring programs have needed to respond to challenges to these commonplaces. Such challenges may arise from a network of situations and stakeholders, including the program administrator's own observations, pressure from budgetary constraints, questions by administration, or needs of the graduate students themselves. We find ourselves in a kairotic moment that requires us to reflect on why we do what we do in the ways we do it. From this reflection, change is inevitable and possibly may be taking very different forms. Have you pushed back on some of these commonplaces? Have you found validation for/through them? Can you offer some uncommonplaces for all of us to consider?&lt;/p&gt;",
