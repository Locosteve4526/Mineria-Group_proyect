        "Description/Abstract": "This study presents the design and implementation of a science,\ntechnology, engineering, and math (STEM) + C (computing) curriculum\nfor upper elementary students (4th to 6th grade) in an after-school\nprogram for eight weeks. The STEM+C curriculum, which was guided by\nthe project-based learning (PBL) approach, consists of two PBL projects\nand aims to integrate computational thinking (CT) in STEM education.\nPreliminary results with seventy-two students in after-school settings\nshowed that the STEM+C curriculum significantly improved students\u2019\nattitude toward mathematics. However, there was no significant difference\nregarding students\u2019 attitudes toward science, engineering, and technology\nbefore and after their eight-week participation. The discourse analysis of\nweekly video recordings of students while participating in two PBL\nprojects revealed a range of complexity and variation of CT in students.\nMain implications of the study provide insights for how to integrate\ncomputational thinking in K-12 (kindergarten to high school) STEM\neducation, how to design a STEM+C curriculum, and the design of\nlearning tasks and learning activities to facilitate the development of CT\ncompetencies in students.\n",
