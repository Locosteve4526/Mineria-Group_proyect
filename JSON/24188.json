        "Description/Abstract": "Several studies have shown that when teachers teach for conceptual and procedural understanding, rather than focusing solely on computational fluency, student achievement improves (Haycock, 2001; Knapp, 1995; Newmann &amp; Associates, 1996). But because teachers themselves learned mathematics through a system that emphasized procedural fluency, many teachers currently lack the conceptual basis to teach conceptually. There is thus a need for high-quality professional development that gives teachers both the knowledge and the pedagogical tools to teach for deep mathematical understanding. This chapter describes one successful effort to develop and implement a professional development framework that models what teaching for understanding looks like while deepening teachers\u2019 own conceptual content knowledge.",
