        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;This paper presents impacts of the pilot conditional cash transfer programme in Paraguay. The choice of outcomes of interest is based on the work developed by the family counselling component undertaken by social workers. Propensity score techniques are used to deal with the problem of non-random treatment assignment. Tekopor\u00e3 has had a positive effect on investment in agriculture, savings, and on the possession of identity card, but did not have much impact on access to credit and on social participation. These results suggest that conditional cash transfer programmes can have impacts that go beyond the usual impacts on consumption, and health and education outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;",
