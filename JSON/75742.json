        "Description/Abstract": "Wildfires have short- and long-term impacts on the geoenvironment, including the changes&lt;br&gt;to biogeochemical and mechanical properties of soils, landfill stability, surface- and groundwater, air&lt;br&gt;pollution, and vegetation. Climate change has increased the extent and severity of wildfires across&lt;br&gt;the world. Simultaneously, anthropogenic activities\u2014through the expansion of urban areas into&lt;br&gt;wildlands, abandonment of rural practices, and accidental or intentional fire-inception activities\u2014are&lt;br&gt;also responsible for a majority of fires. This paper provides an overall review and critical appraisal of&lt;br&gt;existing knowledge about processes induced by wildfires and their impact on the geoenvironment.&lt;br&gt;Burning of vegetation leads to loss of root reinforcement and changes in soil hydromechanical&lt;br&gt;properties. Also, depending on the fire temperature, soil can be rendered hydrophobic or hydrophilic\u00a0 and compromise soil nutrition levels, hinder revegetation, and, in turn, increase post-fire erosion&lt;br&gt;and the debris flow susceptibility of hillslopes. In addition to direct hazards, wildfires pollute air&lt;br&gt;and soil with smoke and fire suppression agents releasing toxic, persistent, and relatively mobile&lt;br&gt;contaminants into the geoenvironment. Nevertheless, the mitigation of wildfires\u2019 geoenvironmental&lt;br&gt;impacts does not fit within the scope of this paper. In the end, and in no exhaustive way, some of the&lt;br&gt;areas requiring future research are highlighted.",
