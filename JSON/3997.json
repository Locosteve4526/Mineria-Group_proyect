        "Description/Abstract": "57 female and 59 male college students completed the Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (CCQ) and a number of personality measures. Results indicated some gender differences in the measures, and a significant positive correlation between caffeine use and extraversion. It is suggested that the CCQ allows general users and researchers a precise and consistent measure of caffeine use and can be used as a tool to pursue other potential relationships between student characteristics and caffeine use.",
