The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=2 has a solution is 23, but the smallest y in this case is also 1, which is equal to the previous record y. So 23 is not a term.\n\nThe next prime, D, after 23 for which x^2-D*y^2=2 has a solution is 31 and the least y for which it has a solution is y=7, which is larger than 1, so it is a new record y value. So 31 is a term.",
