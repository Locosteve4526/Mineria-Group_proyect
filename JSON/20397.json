        "Description/Abstract": "Speech and Repression in H.D.\u2019s Ion\r\nIn her translation of the Ion of Euripides, H.D. emphasizes the centrality of speech.  Speaking is often performative in the play (as when Hermes ritually identifies Ion at the end of the Prologue, or when Apollo designates Xouthos as Ion\u2019s father). Speaking is also the means by which the burden of Kreousa\u2019s secret past is lifted.  In H.D.\u2019s translation, the conflict between speech and repression parallels the conflict between Kreousa\u2019s quest for justice and Apollo\u2019s assertion of divine authority.  \r\nAt one point in the play, moreover, the Choros refers to the dance of \u201cthree sisters\u201d on \u201cthe rock of Makra, associated with the god Pan (189).  In a note to W.S. DiPiero\u2019s translation of the play, Peter Burian explains that this passage refers to the daughters of Aglauros (Kreousa\u2019s ancestors), and he mentions a festival that commemorates their experience, sometimes called the Arrephoria (90).  The name of this festival evidently refers to the bearing of secret or \u201cunnamed\u201d items by participants in the festival (Harrison 122).  According to Liddell and Scott\u2019s Greek-English Lexicon, the first part of the word comes from ta arr?ta, meaning things \u201csecret\u201d or \u201cshameful to be spoken.\u201d  The festival is linked to the violation of a taboo: the daughters of Aglauros look in a basket entrusted to them, in which they discover the infant Erichthonius and are punished for their disobedience.  Since this passage refers to an event that occurs in the same place where Apollo had sex with Kreousa and where Kreousa abandoned her baby (215-216), secrets become linked with repression, ritual, and speech in a powerful but contradictory way that puts Kreousa\u2019s anger about the god\u2019s injustice in the context of her family\u2019s history and the natural cycle of seasons (Goff 363).  \r\n\r\nWorks Cited\r\nEuripides.
