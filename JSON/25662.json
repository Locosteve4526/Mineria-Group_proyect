        "Description/Abstract": "What are the desired outcomes of an undergraduate education in  psychology? It is vital to identify the desired outcomes that benefit  departments, students, and society, because the pursuit of these goals  helps psychology educators achieve the best possible learning experience  for their students. We purposely take a different approach to what  might be expected of an outcomes chapter in a review of  undergraduate psychology education. We address methods that departments  and educational institutions use to assess the outcomes of psychology  education from the standpoint of departmental performance and student  achievement. We identify goals of the undergraduate experience held by  psychology faculty, employers, and students and we examine current  indicators of postbaccalaureate success through educational outcomes. We  then place our students' achievements in a broader context of societal  demands and global expectations. We conclude this chapter with specific  recommendations and a call to action.",
