        "Description/Abstract": "Purpose: Research dissemination is a core mission for all universities.  As a result, libraries should adopt this mission, utilizing institutional repositories services to support this goal.  This paper explores management models that institutional repositories can use for this purpose.  \n\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: By using research dissemination as a primary objective, individual management models are reviewed for their ability to accomplish this goal. Institutional repository services resulting from this purpose are also described.\n\nFindings: By adopting these kinds of models, libraries can develop new services that go beyond traditional library services and provide key support for the dissemination of a university\u2019s scholarship.\n\nOriginality/Value:  This article challenges the existing ideology surrounding institutional repositories and helps frame these services as a core component for fulfilling an important university mission.\n",
