        "Description/Abstract": "Dominance of a particular personality type in the security field could lead to weakness in defense if it is true that predominance of one type of system security professional personality limits the approaches to problem solving and if a narrowing of approaches to problem solving is an indicator of system vulnerability (Gates &amp; Whalen, 2004). Although much work has been done to analyze the attackers, little has been done to understand the defenders (Gates &amp; Whalen, 2004). Accordingly, there is the need for research to identify any significant differences between the problem solving approaches of teams of systems professionals of the same personality type relative to that of a team of diverse personalities. It is the hypothesis of this paper that groups comprised of diverse personality types produce more unique solutions, given a problem-solving task, than groups comprised of the same personality type. A study of the fore-mentioned groups using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is discussed and the results anticipated from the groups' participation in a problem-solving task and subsequent group analysis survey. Results indicating a broadened perspective attributed to personality type diversification would lead to further research to establish a correlation between heightened idea generation and improved system security function.",
