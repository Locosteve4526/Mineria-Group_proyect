        "Description/Abstract": "Over the past decade, three doctoral programs have been launched at This Metropolitan State University. The first doctoral program established was in Electrical and Computer Engineering, selected because of the need for a trained workforce in the region. The other two doctoral programs, Materials Science and Engineering, and Computing, were from the start designed as interdisciplinary degree programs. That is, they were designed for the participation of not just program faculty within the division, but for the participation of program faculty with related research interests in other departments at the university. This paper presents the steps taken to launch the programs, lessons learned in initiating and administering the programs, best practices undertaken, and challenges faced by the emerging doctoral degree programs.
