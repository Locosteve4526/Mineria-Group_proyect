It shows how questions of sensitive and attuned action as well as educators\u2019 relations with children and the young are special\u2014uniquely different from other relations and attunements. This collection introduces readers to both classical and contemporary texts, offering many of these in translation for the first time. These illuminate the struggles and rewards of teaching, showing teaching to be an art, simultaneously a personal and professional calling.\n\nI am the editor and translator of this book; it includes multiple chapter introductions written by me.",
