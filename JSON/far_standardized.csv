On the one hand, it is said to enforce ‘epic’ images of science that celebrate the heroes and heroic deeds that established the scienti?c canon and its methods and thereby falsi?es the history and nature of science. On the other hand, the sciences are presented as objective, making factual statements independent of location and time--a claim that runs counter to the current mainstream canon of scienti?c knowledge as socially and individually constructed. In this article, we suggest that contexts leading to new scienti?c knowledge make science objective and subjective simultaneously. Our approach, which focuses on the performative dimensions of (school) science, works to overcome the distinctions between knowledge and knowing and the associated distinction between theory and practice. We show the signi?cance of the performative dimension through a comparison of anatomy lectures and texts from the 17th century and in present-day biology classrooms. We underscore the need to retain and investigate the historical connections between the founding of (scienti?c) knowledge and its present-day form taught in schools.",,"['Friesen, N.']",http://www.medienimpulse.at/articles/view/516,"[{""id"": 1212, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2012/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

We argue that it does, and it is a difference that matters. Canadian efforts toward multilateralism and toward inclusiveness (e.g., willingness to work with weaker nations) serve as a counter balance to the growing unilateralism and ever present exceptionalism of the United States, currently the most powerful country in the world, and Canada's southern neighbor and regional partner in developing environmental policy that affects the northern Americas directly and all of the Americas indirectly. Our argument is made first generally, and then specifically using involvement and reaction to the goals set out by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC), where, along with Mexico, Canada and the United States play leading roles. The basic contention of this paper is that the vision for and goals of the CEC are much more aligned with the way Canada perceives the way international environmental policymaking should be implemented, and that by fostering that vision, Canada tries to counter the tendency of the present-day United States administration to go at it alone, and thereby provides a linkage to other countries in the Americas to position themselves for participation in regional environmental policymaking.",,"['Alm, L.

The president of the Basque Country traveled with a dozen other representatives from the Basque government and a press entourage that beamed back live coverage for those still at home. On behalf of the state, Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne received the Lagun Ona (Good Friend) award, the most prestigious honor given by the Basque government, and the secretary of state and mayor of Boise, both of whom are of Basque ancestry, served as hosts for delegates from the Basque region. The festivities filled venues such as the Morrison Center, the Egyptian Theatre, the Fairgrounds and of course, Boise's Basque Block in the heart of downtown.

We argue that it does, and it is a difference that matters. Canadian efforts toward multilateralism and toward inclusiveness (e.g., willingness to work with weaker nations) serve as a counter balance to the growing unilateralism and ever present exceptionalism of the United States, currently the most powerful country in the world, and Canada's southern neighbor and regional partner in developing environmental policy that affects the northern Americas directly and all of the Americas indirectly. Our argument is made first generally, and then specifically using involvement and reaction to the goals set out by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC), where, along with Mexico, Canada and the United States play leading roles. The basic contention of this paper is that the vision for and goals of the CEC are much more aligned with the way Canada perceives the way international environmental policymaking should be implemented, and that by fostering that vision, Canada tries to counter the tendency of the present-day United States administration to go at it alone, and thereby provides a linkage to other countries in the Americas to position themselves for participation in regional environmental policymaking.",,"['Alm, L.

Pushing the Boundaries of Gender and Lay Roles in the Catholic Church, 1534-1829",2018.0,Palgrave MacMillan,"London/New York, NY",978-3-319-73086-8,,"Book accepted for publication by Palgrave MacMillan in 2017. Revisions completed and accepted as of November 2017. Book is currently at the printers with scheduled delivery of page proofs the first week of February 2018. The Catholic Church in the 21st century wrestles with expanding opportunities for laypeople to participate in ministry, sacrament, and leadership of the Church, particularly over whether women should be ordained to the priesthood and whether laypeople should be given greater roles in liturgy. Some Catholics welcome such possibilities. Others fear that changes in traditional practices will weaken the foundations of the Church, the family, and society. The Catholic Church faced a similar challenge after English King Henry VIII’s break with Rome in 1534. For almost 300 years, Catholicism was illegal throughout the British Isles. In the absence of churches, priests, and sacraments, Catholics broadened gender and religious roles to meet their spiritual needs within an underground faith. The intervening three centuries allegedly fostered a world of bad Catholics with divided loyalties between church, state, society, and the family: scandalous “galloping nuns,” “Apostolic Viragoes,” and “false” and “traitorous” Catholic “rogues.” This book explores how Catholics experimented with new understandings of women’s and men’s roles in family life, ritual, religious leadership, and vocation in their quest to be both good Catholics and good subjects. Engaging personal narratives, letters, trial records, and other stories reveal how far ordinary Catholics would go to get their needs met and how far the Catholic Church would bend its rules on gender and laypeoples' roles in the Church to sustain beleaguered Catholics in a Protestant land. In the many generations that passed between Henry VIII’s break with the Roman Catholic Church and Catholic emancipation in the British Isles in 1829, Catholics had time to set limits, loosen them, and face the consequences. The lessons learned inform our contemporary discussion not only about women’s and men’s natural and God-given roles but also about divine power and authority itself.

As long as they fail, fast, forward. The popular rhetoric around failure lifts the taboo by reframing failure as a ubiquitous experience and learnable skill. The consequence of this rhetorical trend, however, is that the failure stigma is not lifted but postponed. While failure rhetoric flourishes, the threat of becoming a failure looms more heavily and with an intensified sense of personal responsibility, due to the underlying message that the true failures fail at failing. By developing responses that are analytical and reflective, and by turning a critical eye toward the rhetorical construction of the failure stories that are shared publicly, we can explore ways to better understand and voice the unspeakable failures.",,"['Myers, K.

Through two plots of this novel, one economic and one focused on courtship, Burney interprets clandestine marriage as a scapegoat for the deeply flawed institution of marriage itself. The courtship narrative rewrites several aspects of conventional clandestine marriage plots, such as stock male characters, lengthy debates between love and duty, climactic wedding scenes, and punitive conclusions. The economic plot, featuring the stories of Mrs. Hill, Henrietta Belfield, and Pricilla Harrel, undermines Parliament’s claims about the economic outcomes of heiresses’ marital choices. The economic plot eventually usurps the courtship plot, leading to a dystopian conclusion that tacitly argues marriage itself is the problem, not deviations from an idealized norm of parentally approved companionate marriages of choice.",,"['Campbell, A.

Rural counties such as those in the Great Basin are in large part dependent upon federal paybacks and Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILTs), yet the region has a strong tradition of resistance to big government.

The research data, which includes measures of N = 101 general education university students’ pre- and post-instruction performance on a Gravity Concept Inventory, indicates instruction on the rubber sheet analogy can be moderately successful at reducing the prevalence of students’ misconceptions about gravity, including students’ beliefs that atmosphere, rotation, and magnetism affect gravity.

The dominance of the United States in its advocacy in environmental protection and Canada’s supportive role and eventual adjustment to the policy priorities of the United States is emphasized. We then focus on the domestic environmental policy-making process and public opinion about the importance of the environment in relation to other public policy concerns.

He focuses on the role that science and scientists played in both defining the acid rain problem as one worthy of policy consideration and in framing the acid rain issue in a way that would prompt action to reduce pollution levels.A major concern of Alm's study are the problems scientists have in connecting to the policy side of environmental debates. He provides in-depth exchanges from the floor of Congress between scientists and policy makers as they debated the merits of reducing acid rain pollution. These exchanges provide special insight into the difficulty that scientists have in communicating the findings of their research to policy makers and the public. In addition, he uses in-depth interviews with the acid-rain scientists themselves to delineate the way they perceive how science is and ought to be linked to the policy world. Finally, Alm looks at the different perspectives offered by United States scientists versus Canadian scientists and natural scientists versus social scientists, and he examines the importance and implications of these differences to the future of environmental policy making in the United States.",,"['Alm, L.

FAR,23364,111110410,111110410,"Turmoil in American Public Policy: Science, Democracy, and the Environment",2010.0,"ABC-CLIO, LLC",,,,"This book explores the intricacies of the science-policy linkage that pervades environmental policymaking in a democracy.To what extent should science inform and shape the environmental policymaking process? By what mechanisms does it do so in the United States and other liberal democracies? How can scientists most effectively discharge their duty as citizens and public trustees to ensure that environmental policymaking in the United States is scientifically sound?These are the key questions that this primary textbook for courses on American public policymaking and environmental policymaking addresses and attempts to answer. Turmoil in American Public Policy: Science, Democracy, and the Environment first lays out the basics of the policymaking process in the United States in relation to the substantive issues of environmental policymaking. Drawing on hundreds of interviews, the authors highlight the views and experiences of scientists, especially natural scientists, in their interactions with policymakers and their efforts to harness the findings of their science to rational public policy. The proper role of science and scientists in relation to environmental policymaking hinges on fundamental questions at the intersection of political philosophy and scientific epistemology. How can the experimental nature of the scientific method and the probabilistic expression of scientific results be squared with the normative language of legislation and regulation? If scientists undertake to square the circle by hardening the tentative truths of their scientific models into positive truths to underpin public policy, at what point may they be judged to have exceeded the proper limits of scientific knowledge, relinquished their role as impartial experts, and become partisan advocates demanding too much say in a democratic setting? Providing students—and secondarily policymakers, scientists, and citizen activists—a theoretical and practical knowledge of the means availed by modern American democracy for resolving this tension is the object of this progressively structured textbook.",,"['Alm, L.

In context of recent debates over the discipline of postcolonial studies, I think aloud in this paper my own ideas about teaching world literature.

In what follows, I ‘argue’ in favor of a pedagogy that not only situates the teaching of world literature in a postcolonial world, but also in a posthuman world. Issues such as where it [world literature] is taught, to whom it is taught, and how it is taught, I believe, cannot be separated from the issue of ‘when’ it is taught.

FAR,24094,111110070,111110070,"Turmoil in American Public Policy: Science, Democracy, and the Environment",2010.0,"ABC-CLIO, LLC",,,,"This book explores the intricacies of the science-policy linkage that pervades environmental policymaking in a democracy.To what extent should science inform and shape the environmental policymaking process? By what mechanisms does it do so in the United States and other liberal democracies? How can scientists most effectively discharge their duty as citizens and public trustees to ensure that environmental policymaking in the United States is scientifically sound?These are the key questions that this primary textbook for courses on American public policymaking and environmental policymaking addresses and attempts to answer. Turmoil in American Public Policy: Science, Democracy, and the Environment first lays out the basics of the policymaking process in the United States in relation to the substantive issues of environmental policymaking. Drawing on hundreds of interviews, the authors highlight the views and experiences of scientists, especially natural scientists, in their interactions with policymakers and their efforts to harness the findings of their science to rational public policy. The proper role of science and scientists in relation to environmental policymaking hinges on fundamental questions at the intersection of political philosophy and scientific epistemology. How can the experimental nature of the scientific method and the probabilistic expression of scientific results be squared with the normative language of legislation and regulation? If scientists undertake to square the circle by hardening the tentative truths of their scientific models into positive truths to underpin public policy, at what point may they be judged to have exceeded the proper limits of scientific knowledge, relinquished their role as impartial experts, and become partisan advocates demanding too much say in a democratic setting? Providing students—and secondarily policymakers, scientists, and citizen activists—a theoretical and practical knowledge of the means availed by modern American democracy for resolving this tension is the object of this progressively structured textbook.",,"['Alm, L.

As Martin Jay points out, the metaphor of the constellation also travelled from Benjamin via Theodore Adorno to America and back to Europe, to re-emerge in Adorno’s postwar writings while he was at the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. As Jay explains, in the context of this exchange, the term constellation signified “a juxtaposed rather than integrated cluster of changing elements that resist reduction to a common denominator, essential core, or generative first principle” (1984, pp. 14-15). These characteristics also generally apply to the term “constellation” as I consider it here. In the instance of travel that is my principle focus, Giedion serves as an indispensable conduit between Benjamin and McLuhan. I close with a comparison of the implications of McLuhan’s use of the constellation with those of Benjamin’s earlier use of the term, and how it reflects the modernist historiography particular to each thinker.",,"['Friesen, N.']",http://learningspaces.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Wandering-Star-BenjaminGiedionMcLuhan21.pdf,"[{""id"": 24658, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2015/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 24658, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2013/01"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

These issues include the development of technical media that were profoundly reshaping nearly all aspects of everyday reality in Dewey’s time.

It is therefore surprising how rarely instructional theories, methods and applications -e.g., learning theories learning designs or learning environments ? are considered specifically as technologies in the relevant literature. This chapter focuses on the instrumental nature of the concept ‘learning’ and learning theory, which Gert Biesta and others have characterized as being manifest in a ‘new language of learning.’ This refers to a vocabulary or discourse that, for example, characterizes ‘‘teaching’ [as the] ‘facilitation of learning’ [and], ‘education’ [as the] ‘provision of learning opportunities’’ (Haugsbak & Nordkvelle, 2007, p. 2). The paper argues that this vocabulary represents a particular technologization or instrumentalization of education, a process that makes educational practices and priorities appear germane to, or even incomplete without, technological rationalization and reshaping. This paper traces how this vocabulary casts learning as a natural and universal process, and quite consistently accompanies the promotion of a range of technological artifacts in education. Running from the introduction of ‘teaching machines’ through to current visions of school reform, this theoretical lexicon will be shown to efface its cultural and ideological contingency through a quasi?scientific ‘neutrality’ and a biologically?based universality, and to limit the possibility for educational discourse and practice.",,"['Friesen, N.']",http://learningspaces.org/papers/langoflearning.pdf,"[{""id"": 24662, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2013/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

It is consequently not surprising that Ludwig Wittgenstein’s work, particularly in the Philosophical Investigations, has been taken up by philosophers of education in English. Michael A. Peters (1999), Christopher Winch (2002), Smeyers & Burbules (2010), and others (e.g. Aparece 2005) have engaged extensively with the implications of the later Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mind and language for education. One challenge that that they face is Wittgenstein’s use of the word “training” throughout his discussions of language learning and in his periodic references to education. This is made all the more problematic by realizing that the term Wittgenstein actually used was Abrichtung, which refers exclusively to animal dressage or obedience training, connoting also the breaking of an animal’s will. I argue that little-recognized fact has broad significance for many important Wittgenstinian insights into education, effectively meaning that the gap between present and future generations is one of coercion and pain, rather than upbringing and care. This paper sheds light on these, and concludes by considering how an unflinching recognition of the implications of Wittgenstein’s choice of words casts him as a tragic philosopher of education and upbringing.",,"['Friesen, N.']",http://normfriesen.info/papers/Lost_in%20_Translation.pdf,"[{""id"": 24669, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 24669, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2015, ""termid"": ""2015/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

The assigned project was to design a biomedical robot to work in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) to perform tasks such as transporting supplies or delivering paperwork. Students with diverse skills and majors were grouped in ten teams, two to three students each. Student learning activities included designing a robot from a box of FisherTechnik materials, without the aid of instruction manuals; writing program code using the PCS environment; and integrating hardware and software. After four weeks of building, training, and testing, each teampsilas robot was unique. In the final competition, each robot was assigned to a particular room in the ICU to perform a specific task.

As Johnson recalls his trial and long journey toward freedom through five Georgia prisons, he speaks candidly about everything from his middle-class childhood in Atlanta to the reasons he became a rape suspect to the steadfast support of his family. However disturbed readers may become by this portrait of a justice system undermined by its own cynicism, Johnson feels no bitterness toward his accusers.

In this book, editors R. Eric Landrum and Maureen McCarthy identify four broad areas of concern in the ethical teaching of undergraduate psychology: pedagogy, student behavior, faculty behavior toward students, and considerations in the diverse classroom. Together with their team of experts, they provide evidence-based advice and case studies that illustrate the application of relevant ethical principles. Ethical teachers need to reflect on commonly accepted practices and make individual decisions about responsible teaching behaviors, such as honoring individual differences and respectfully challenging beliefs. Other challenges examined in this book include grading, textbook adoption, honor systems, online instruction, and conducting and using research on pedagogy to improve classroom practice. Infusing the undergraduate experience with ethics is the focus of chapters on supervising student internships, coauthoring research with students, and modeling appropriate professional boundaries. Readers will find a host of practical suggestions for approaching ethics proactively in both traditional and virtual classrooms. This book will become an instant resource for all teachers in the social and behavioral sciences who care about ethical interactions between faculty members and students.",,"['Landrum, R.

The book intends to provide sufficient breadth and detail that it stands as a scholarly work, while presenting data in a manner which allows for a wide use of the materials. Thus the book summarizes well-known sites and those less known but important to understanding the regional prehistory. The primary objective of this book is to craft an overview and synthesis of the archaeology of Guyana and in so doing document the diversity of human adaptations over several thousands of years. The ten chapters include an historical overview of the history of archaeological research in Guyana during the late 19th and late 20th centuries; an overview of the geological history, climate and geography; the general chronological context of Guyana prehistory; the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene paleo-environmental context; the evidence for Paleo-Indian occupations; the prehistory of Northwestern Guyana with specific reference to the Archaic shellfisher and later Horticultural patterns of the littoral; the archaeology of the Abary and Hertenrits Phases of Northeastern Guyana; an overview of the Taruma Phase of Southeastern Guyana; the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Horticultural occupations of the Rupununi savannahs; a summary and synthesis of the Iwokrama rainforest in central Guyana; and a review of major developments in Guyana archaeology and future research needs.",,"['Plew, M.

D. Ross. In this book Tony Roark presents an interpretation of the definition that renders it not only non-circular, but also worthy of serious philosophical scrutiny. He shows how Aristotle developed an account of the nature of time that is inspired by Plato while also thoroughly bound up with Aristotle's sophisticated analyses of motion and perception. When Aristotle's view is properly understood, Roark argues, it is immune to devastating objections against the possibility of temporal passage articulated by McTaggart and other 20th century philosophers.

As part of the project, we have developed a series of MATLAB-based simulations delivered through our Blade servers to help students better conceptualize abstract Math concepts. During the fall semester of 2010, we implemented 12 simulations in a Multivariable & Vector Calculus class in which 117 students were enrolled. To better understand the overall program usability via Blade servers and the value of the simulations from the student perspective, we conducted an evaluation study and answered the following three questions: 1. How do students perceive the use of interactive simulations in their Math class? 2. How do students? motivational characteristics (e.g., intrinsic and extrinsic goal orientations and confidence levels in studying science, math and engineering) relate to their perceptions in using simulations during the Math class? and 3. What aspects of the simulation programs should be improved? The study revealed that about 74% of students rated the value of simulations as high or moderate. The simulations tend to be attractive to students with high intrinsic goal orientation, while their value perceptions were not related to students' extrinsic goal orientation and confidence levels. The data also showed areas for improvement, based on which we have generated a ""things to do"" list to make the simulation programs more easily accessible and valuable to students in the future semesters.",,"['Chyung, S.

FAR,26686,111111683,111111683,Field Flow Fractionation Handbook,2000.0,Wiley-Interscience,,,,"Field-flow fractionation (FFF) occupies a unique niche in the field of analytical separations because it is the only technique that is capable of separating materials over the entire colloidal size range (1-1,000 nm) with high resolution. Still, FFF has not enjoyed what can be considered an explosive phase of growth, like those encountered in the development of gas and liquid chromatography. There are many theories as to why this is so, and certainly a combination of factors if responsible. FFF practitioners clearly agree that one hindrance to the widespread use of FFF as a routine tool for sizing macromolecules and colloids stems from its greatest asset. That asset is its versatility, and versatility comes with a price. Thus, even though FFF is applicable to an incredible range of materials, from macromolecules of a few thousand grams per mode or more to particles as large as 100 ?m, there is no simple formula for choosing the proper subtechnique, let alone the experimental variables within a given subtechnique for a given application. One must understand the underlying mechanism of the separation and gather a certain amount of experience to apply FFF to a new separation problem with reasonable success or efficiency. The goal of this handbook is to provide a useful guide to the implementation of FFF by first-time or infrequent users, while serving as a broad reference for more experienced FFF practitioners. In addressing this goal, than handbook contains a comprehensive description of the four primary FFF subtechniques, with specific examples and applications for each. Perhaps the greatest value, of this handbook lies in the fact that the authors are experts in the respective subtechniques that they address and so are able to advise the reader, from firsthand experience, on how to avoid certain pitfalls associated with developing and implementing FFF applications.",,"['Schimpf, M.

Our focus is on nuclear sci-entists and engineers, and the interventions that might be made to prepare them for nov-el kinds of climate disruptions and how these disruptions could affect plant design and operations. Events at Fukushima in 2011 prompted renewed attention to nuclear safety. Soon after, scientists recorded record-breaking global temperatures, particularly during the summer of 2012. Perhaps as a result of these two events, academics and the media have begun asking whether nuclear power plants are robust to natural events beyond the range of historical data, including climate-related events such as increasing drought and rising cooling-water temperatures. Science policy scholars, scientists, and engineers outside of nuclear science and engineering have begun to pose similar questions and model possible effects. Our study demonstrates that there is almost no public discourse and very little professional discourse within nuclear science and engineering on this top-ic.

Students were asked to write down as many famous or historically important scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. After one minute, they were instructed to write down as many famous or historically important women scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. For the first question, 95% of the responses referred to male scientists, inventors or engineers. For the second question, respondents named on average less than one woman (M=.86), and those named were more often from non-STEM fields (e.g., Rosa Parks) than actual scientists, inventors or engineers. Additionally, while respondents named a total of 279 distinct men, they named only 35 distinct women. Students in STEM fields could name significantly more male scientists, inventors or engineers than non-STEM students, but could not name significantly more women. The implications of these results are discussed, along with suggestions for educators on how to integrate the contributions of women in STEM into the classroom.",,"['Stipp, H. R.', 'Pyke, P.

FAR,2730,111110155,111110155,Against Realist Instruction: Superficial Success Masking Catastrophic Failure and an Alternative,2005.0,,,,,"Purpose: Often radical constructivists are confronted with arguments why radical constructivism is wrong. The present work presents a radical constructivist alternative to such arguments: a comparison of the results of two instructional practices, the standard, realistbased instruction and a radical constructivist-based instruction, both in physics courses. Design: Evidence from many studies of student conceptions in standard instruction (Duit 2004) is taken into account. In addition, diagnostic data, pre and post instruction, were collected from over 1,000 students in multiple institutions across the U. S. over a period of about 15 years via an established diagnostic of conceptual understanding of motion and force. Findings: Evidence from many studies of student conceptions in standard instruction (Duit, 2004) is that little or no change in student conceptions happens in standard instruction. About half the students in the particular study reported, all science and engineering majors, experienced standard, realist-based instruction and show an average effect size of 0.6 standard deviations and an average normalized gain of 15%. The other half of the students, none of whom were science and engineering majors, experienced radical constructivist- based instruction and show an average effect size over 2.5 standard deviations and an average normalized gain over 60%. Diagnostic pre scores were nearly the same for both groups. Practical implications: The outcome, that students, neither science nor engineering majors, made changes in understanding foundational topics in physics far greater than science and engineering students, poses (1) an ethical challenge to the continued adherence to standard, realist-based instructional practices and (2) an intellectual challenge to the usefulness and appropriateness of the elitist-realist paradigm on which such standard instruction is based. Conclusions: This radical constructivist argument uses the effect of paradigms to judge their pragmatic value, not their truth-value. Based on pragmatic value, radical constructivism results in superior outcomes when applied to physics instruction. The approach to instruction can be applied generally in education.",,"['Dykstra Jr, D.

Parallels with the Middle Way school of Buddhism appear to shed light on this challenge. Conclusions: The hegemony realism has over the thinking of even the most highly educated in our civilization plays a major role in their failure to understand RC. Those still subject to realism in their thinking interpret statements by those in RC in ways incompatible with RC. Until realists disequilibrate over mismatches between realist expectations and experiences, no alternative way of thinking is accessible to them and misinterpretations of RC will continue. Practical implications: While we cannot change someone else's understanding, in our interactions with them we can focus on creating situations in which those who do not understand us might disequilibrate. If we are successful, they are likely to begin to escape the domination of realism in their thinking. Value: This insight may enable eventual success in our assisting others to understand RC.",,"['Dykstra Jr, D.

The biosocial perspective is quite different. It assumes that biological and environmental factors interact to affect criminal behavior. Social environmental explanations have dominated the field of criminology for at least the past century. Supporters of this perspective argue that because criminal is an ever-changing legal designation, it makes no sense to believe that crimes are the result of biology. Biosocial theorists concede that criminality is a legal concept, but argue that at the core of the concept are acts that are recognized as unacceptable in all societies. The theme of this book is simple: Biology matters when trying to understand criminal behavior. This is not to exclude social factors but to maintain that social and biological factors interact to affect our varying tendencies to violate criminal statutes. Despite the conceptual simplicity of the biosocial perspective, the evidence that supports it is often complex and rests upon a number of biological principles that many criminologists do not understand. This book conveys some of the excitement that those working from a biosocial perspective are experiencing as they make new discoveries about how biological and social factors interact to affect criminal behavior.",,"['Walsh, A.', 'Ellis, L.']",http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/91,"[{""id"": 27477, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2003, ""termid"": ""2002/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,27490,111110252,111110252,Feminist Criminology through a Biosocial Lens,2011.0,Carolina Academic Press,,,,"The gender ratio problem (why always and everywhere males commit more criminal acts than females) has been called the single most important fact that criminology theories must be able to explain. Feminist criminology has attempted to do this for decades without success because it has relied on conceptual and theoretical tools from a single discipline — sociology. A number of famous criminologists (e.g., Travis Hirschi) have concluded that an explanation of gender differences in crime from the sociological perspective may not be possible because it excludes biological sex, the powerful underlying base of gender. It is the contention of this book that unless feminist criminology comes to grips with the evolutionary and neurological bases of fundamental gender difference, the field will continue to flounder without compass. A number of other influential criminologists (e.g., Francis Cullen) have concluded that the biosocial paradigm is the paradigm of the 21st century. The biosocial paradigm is growing in strength every year, as an examination of both the number of published books and articles in professional journals in criminology and other social and behavioral science disciplines will attest. This book looks at feminist criminology in general and attempts to explain its main concerns from a biosocial perspective while showing that there is nothing illiberal about it and that biology can be a very powerful ally to criminology. The book ranges across disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, behavioral and molecular genetics, the neurosciences, and evolutionary biology to attempt to answer the gender ratio problem. It is time to apply this exciting and robust paradigm — one that avers that any trait or behavior of any living thing is always the result of biological factors interacting with environmental factors — to the most vexing issues of feminist criminology.",,"['Walsh, A.']",http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/90,"[{""id"": 27490, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,27497,111110252,111110252,Social Class and Crime: A Biosocial Approach,2011.0,Routledge,,,,"Social class has been at the forefront of sociological theories of crime from their inception. It is explicitly central to some theories such as anomie/strain and conflict, and nips aggressively at the periphery of others such as social control theory. Yet none of these theories engage in a systematic exploration of what social class is, how individuals come to be placed in one rung of the class ladder rather than another, or the precise nature of the class-crime relationship. This book avers that the same factors that help to determine a person's class level also help to determine that person's risk for committing criminal acts. Social class is a modern outcome of primordial status-striving and requires explanation using the modern tools of genetics, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology, and this is what this book does. Many aspects of criminal behavior can be understood by examining the shared factors that lead to the success or failure in the workplace and to pro- or antisocial activities. A biosocial approach requires reducing sociology's ""master variable"" to a lower level analysis to examine its constituent parts, which is resisted by many criminologists as highly controversial. However, this book makes plain that the more we know about the nature side of behavior the more important we find the nurture side to be. It makes clear how the class/crime relationship and criminology in general, can benefit from the biosocial perspective; a perspective that many criminological luminaries expect to be the dominant paradigm for the twenty first century.",,"['Walsh, A.']",http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/fac_books/24,"[{""id"": 27497, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,27531,111670037,111670037,"Participatory Budgeting in Brazil: Contestation, Cooperation, and Accountability",2007.0,Pennsylvania State University Press,,,,"As Brazil and other countries in Latin America turned away from their authoritarian past and began the transition to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, interest in developing new institutions to bring the benefits of democracy to the citizens in the lower socioeconomic strata intensified, and a number of experiments were undertaken. Perhaps the one receiving the most attention has been Participatory Budgeting (PB), first launched in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre in 1989 by a coalition of civil society activists and Workers' Party officials. PB quickly spread to more than 250 other municipalities in the country, and it has since been adopted in more than twenty countries worldwide. Most of the scholarly literature has focused on the successful case of Porto Alegre and has neglected to analyze how it fared elsewhere. In this first rigorous comparative study of the phenomenon, Brian Wampler draws evidence from eight municipalities in Brazil to show the varying degrees of success and failure PB has experienced. He identifies why some PB programs have done better than others in achieving the twin goals of ensuring governmental accountability and empowering citizenship rights for the poor residents of these cities in the quest for greater social justice and a well-functioning democracy. Conducting extensive interviews, applying a survey to 650 PB delegates, doing detailed analysis of budgets, and engaging in participant observation, Wampler finds that the three most important factors explaining the variation are the incentives for mayoral administrations to delegate authority, the way civil society organizations and citizens respond to the new institutions, and the particular rule structure that is used to delegate authority to citizens.",,"['Wampler, B.

FAR,27579,112139145,112139145,Critical Insights: Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior,2016.0,,,,978-1-68217-394-7 (hardcover);  978-1-68217-395-4 (e-book),"The Mother’s Mark on the Daughter’s Speech in The Woman Warrior In The Woman Warrior, Kingston draws on many resources to develop a story about her protagonist’s individual development. As the daughter of Chinese immigrants, she finds herself investigating selfhood in more than individual terms. Her story is suffused with uncertainty, fantasy, and ambiguity, all of which she navigates through dramatic metaphors of voice and writing. The book as a whole challenges its readers to consider the ways that language frames and generates meaning, showing that selfhood is shaped by culture. In this chapter, I will draw upon three categories—prohibition, inscription, and incision—to examine Kingston’s responses to her mother and her legacy as the child of Chinese immigrants. In particular, I will focus on the fact that, in a book rich with ambiguities, Kingston makes it clear that selfhood is not achieved in isolation. Although individuation is important for self-development, selves mature in relation to family, history, language, and the contemporary world. Kingston figures these relationships in several ways, but the mother’s role in embodying or mediating most of them is a consistent theme throughout the book. By focusing on Kingston’s references to prohibited speech, writing, and scarification (in the form of tattooing or surgical cutting), I will demonstrate some of the ways in which The Woman Warrior portrays selfhood in dynamic and contingent terms, as a process. Kingston prominently features the role of writing in the articulation of this process, implying that selfhood is an ongoing negotiation instead of a finished condition. The first chapter of The Woman Warrior, “No Name Woman,” begins and ends with a dramatic prohibition. However, the very existence of the chapter, as Kingston’s narrator makes clear, is an ironic violation of that prohibition. By beginning her book in this way, Kingston shows that her protagonist Maxine must engage with the past in order to grow up. She must violate the prohibition against telling the story of No Name Woman in order to articulate her sense of herself and the world that has produced her, and readers must conspire with her in the violation in order to proceed with the text. To accompany Maxine on her adventure of self-knowledge—the adventure of becoming a woman with a name and an identity—readers must trudge with her through a taboo. What does this violation lead to or make possible? In “White Tigers,” one answer seems to be that the narrator is now more free to invent and test new models of identity, a process which depends on the imaginative use of language. In this chapter, Kingston foregrounds the role of writing in the development of her protagonist Maxine, partly through metaphors of Chinese script, as when she likens a bird to “the ideograph for ‘human’” (20), and partly through depicting writing in the form of scarification, as when the litany of revenges is carved into the skin of her protagonist’s back (34-35). In the fantasy interlude in which she imagines herself as Fa Mu Lan, Kingston’s narrator begins to exercise her powers of language to produce more satisfying models of selfhood, models that might withstand the negative pressures of her environment. In the event, this first experiment articulates some important lessons about self-development (such as making mental “room for paradoxes” [29]), but it produces a model which proves only partially adequate or temporarily convincing to Kingston’s protagonist. If the tattooing of the crimes upon Fa Mu Lan’s back provides one example of incision as a phase in the development and growth of the Maxine’s soul, however, it is not the only bodily mutilation that she experiences. The ritual scarification results in an elegant though grisly script that inaugurates her hero’s quest, but Kingston refers to another form of incision in the last chapter of her book. In that chapter, “A Song for a Barbarian Reed Flute,” Kingston’s narrator alleges that her mother cut her frenum, a membrane connected to the tongue. Readers have noted that Kingston both posits this event as factual and undercuts it as unverifiable, since the putative event happened in infancy and the narrator has no recollection of it. The storytelling associated with the event comes to function as a fable because the mother’s stated purpose of cutting the frenum was to liberate the daughter’s speech. Brave Orchid’s argument is that the narrator’s frenum was unduly restrictive, rooting her daughter’s tongue in a position that marred its capacity for speech, especially for speech in more than one language. Hence the action was intended to support her daughter by giving her access to multiple worlds or cultures, an access she needs in order to function as a native-born American daughter of Chinese immigrants. Regardless of the narrator’s conflicted feelings about that maternal support, her decision to end her memoirs with the story about the Barbarian flute song gives the last word not to herself alone but to both her mother and herself, in the form of a collaboration. This choice is Kingston’s final reminder that selfhood is social.",,"['Westover, J.

This turned out to be another instructive exercise in futility. Translation and Transatlantic Crossings in Kevin Young’s Ardency In Ardency (2011), Kevin Young offers a series of interlinked poems depicting the Amistad case, in which enslaved Africans managed to secure their freedom and return to Africa after a prolonged legal battle. In his book, Young resurrects the dead by depicting their words on the pages of his poem, but he reminds his readers that this very process is a translation of experience into representation. Moreover, by focusing on the sailor James Covey’s role as a translator for the Amistad Africans, Young figures him as an alter ego of the poet. In identifying himself with Covey, Young stresses the transatlantic passage of the slave-trade together with the central role of language in the Amistad case. Early in his book, Young subtly suggests the connection between his poetry and the act of translation when Covey asks himself, “Could this be my fate, / my invisible art, to translate an opaque race?” (21). Young plays on the etymological sense of translation and metaphor (“carrying across”) in a wish Covey conveys to his adoptive white father at the close of a letter: “May my words / reach you in manners I never can, crossing boundless blue between” (22). Through this ritual-like valediction, Young figuratively links written communication to the transatlantic crossings of the Middle Passage and the eventual return to Africa of the Amistad rebels. Young turns Covey’s work as translator into a more general allegory of the poet, who translates or bears the words of the past into the present, making them live in a new context. Young’s poetic impersonations of Covey as well as the Amistad rebels “carry over” and transform not only the archival records documenting their struggle, but also the Amistad poems of Elizabeth Alexander (2005) and Robert Hayden (1945/1962).

The methods are based on social-constructivist/socio-cultural theories of literacy learning, and incorporate research on literary response conducted by the authors. Teaching Literature to Adolescents--a totally new text that draws on ideas from the best selling textbook, Teaching Literature in the Secondary School, by Beach and Marshall--reflects and builds on recent key developments in theory and practice in the field, including: *the importance of providing students with a range of critical lenses for analyzing texts and interrogating the beliefs, attitudes, and ideological perspectives encountered in literature; *organization of the literature curriculum around topics, themes, or issues; *infusion of multicultural literature and emphasis on how writers portray race, class, and gender differences; *use of drama as a tool for enhancing understanding of texts; *employment of a range of different ways to write about literature; *integration of critical analysis of film and media texts with the study of literature; *blending of quality young adult literature into the curriculum; and *attention to students who have difficulty succeeding in literature classes due to reading difficulties, disparities between school and home cultures, attitudes toward school/English, or lack of engagement with assigned texts or response activities. Thoughtfully designed to draw readers into interacting with the text, each chapter is organized around a specific question English educators frequently hear in working with pre-service and in-service teachers, and includes a Case Narrative that frames discussion of the issue that is the focus of the chapter. Many chapters include teacher narratives or lesson plans that demonstrate how a teacher implements the proposed methods. All chapters conclude with an Action Research Activity or Portfolio Reflection Activity, and an Additional Online Activities, Links, and Further Reading Suggestions box directing readers to the Teaching Literature Web site designed to be used in conjunction with this text. The interactive Web site contains recommended readings, resources, and activities; links to Web sites and PowerPoint presentations; and opportunities for readers to contribute teaching units to the Web site databases.

FAR,27687,111110214,111110214,Science and Politics: An A to Z Guide to Issues and Controversies,2014.0,CQ Press/ Sage,,,,"Environmental justice refers to the fact that racial and ethnic minority communities bear a disproportionate share of the impact of environmental pollution in the U.S. because those communities are located in or near industrial polluters and toxic waste sites. It is a field of study within the social and environmental sciences as well as a social movement by the same name. In the 1980s, researchers began documenting the fact that racial and ethnic minorities in the United States were more likely to live in or near pollution. By 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency had established an Office of Environmental Justice and federal policy began to focus on ensuring that environmental regulations were applied justly across all segments of U.S. society. Researchers have explained the fact that people of color are more likely to live near environmental pollution by seeking to unravel the effects of historic racial zoning laws, limited economic choices in housing for low income residents, the relative powerlessness of racial minorities in the political process, and overt racism. Translating the science of environmental justice to policy is made complex by two factors. The minority-location studies typically express correlations, or connections, among variables, but do not suggest concrete solutions. Scientists have also examined the impacts of the pollution on those who live nearby by tracing incidences of disease in those populations and comparing those rates to the general population. This type of science establishes relationship between living in an area and a greater than expected rate of disease, but does not prove that any one incidence of cancer is related to a particular toxic waste site. These factors contribute to the debate over the reliability of science in making remediation for exposure to pollutants or in guiding future decisions.",,"['Witt, S.

Vietnam brings the nation's dynamic history, society, religious institutions, and much more to the page.Beginning with a lengthy introduction to Vietnam's past, this book traces the historical context that serves as a foundation for the present-day society and culture of this Southeast Asian nation. Intended for nonspecialists and other Asian enthusiasts, this work gives readers a thorough understanding of this diverse, richly storied land. From Vietnam's indigenous dynasties to outside influences including Buddhism, Confucianism, Western imperialism, and the Chinese bureaucracy system, the long path to a Vietnamese identity is traced—one that showcases a people's resilience, creativity, and intense love of freedom.

I have been able to secure a new contract with Palgrave Press with a Deadline this Spring. This book explores the role of unauthorized water use in the American West (examining 11 Western States including: Arizona, California, Colorado,Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming), and argues that climate change and population growth will put more demand on water management agencies such as Idaho’s Department of Water Resources to demonstrate they are protecting the water rights of their citizens. To assess how well-positioned each state is to adapt to climate and population changes, the author surveyed water management agencies on their unauthorized water use management strategies, finding that states vary significantly in their approaches. After establishing the status quo, the book examines the likely policy options states and the federal government will have in addressing unauthorized water use. Weaving together a narrative drawing from a mixture of political science theory and water policy research, along with interviews of state officials and water users, and primary data, the author tells the story of how proper resource management is central to the social, political, and economic life in the American West.",,"['Castellano, I.

Students were asked to write down as many famous or historically important scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. After one minute, they were instructed to write down as many famous or historically important women scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. For the first question, 95% of the responses referred to male scientists, inventors or engineers. For the second question, respondents named on average less than one woman (M=.86), and those named were more often from non-STEM fields (e.g., Rosa Parks) than actual scientists, inventors or engineers. Additionally, while respondents named a total of 279 distinct men, they named only 35 distinct women. Students in STEM fields could name significantly more male scientists, inventors or engineers than non-STEM students, but could not name significantly more women. The implications of these results are discussed, along with suggestions for educators on how to integrate the contributions of women in STEM into the classroom.",,"['Stipp, H. R.', 'Pyke, P.

The article begins with an analysis of the physical and technical arrangements of the early modern anatomy lecture, showing how these present a general underlying similarity compared to those in place today. It then goes on to consider examples of elements of speech and presentation, description and illustration that are used in the biology lecture from the early modern (sixteenth to seventeenth centuries) and late modern (or contemporary) eras. The anatomy lecture thus demonstrates a basic physical and technical continuity in the classroom or theater, whereas the larger epistemic functions in which it is embedded have changed: from a descriptive, discursive function, focusing on individual organs and their physicality, to one that is more integrative, systemic and also performative in both form and content.",,"['Friesen, N.', 'Roth, W.']",,"[{""id"": 2924, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 2924, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2012/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

In so doing, it introduces a number of concepts from continental media theory that have been developing in the wake of Friedrich Kittler (1943-2011). With the book -both as an artifact and an epistemic metaphor- in evident decline, what is taking its place is not any one new medium, but rather a radically new kind of media systematicity. By relentlessly reducing all content (e.g., music, film, text) to ones and zeros, digitization effectively erases the material characteristics of separate media forms, leaving behind only their conventionalized aesthetic qualities. The paper builds on these arguments by concluding that the symbolic competencies which once constituted the core of all education (reading, writing, ‘rithmatic) are increasingly at odds with performative and stylistic abilities integral to this new mediatic order.",,"['Leschke, R.', 'Friesen, N.']",http://www.medienpaed.com/,"[{""id"": 2933, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2013/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 2933, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2013/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

FAR,29492,114046497,114046497,Measuring rights-based perspective: A validation of the Human Rights Lens in Social Work scale.,2017.0,,,,,"Objective: This article reports the initial validation of the Human Rights Lens in Social Work (HRLSW) scale, a tool designed to measure a social worker’s ability to see individual and social problems as resulting from human rights violations. The purpose of the research was to gather evidence regarding the validity of this multidimensional measure of a new construct, i.e., human rights lens. Method: Data from a convenience sample of 1,014 licensed clinical social workers were collected by electronic survey, and the sample was split to conduct discrete exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The exploratory factor analysis was performed on half of the sample (n 5 507) to establish the underlying factor structure of the construct; the other half of the sample (n 5 507) underwent a confirmatory factor analysis to examine the subsample’s psychometric properties. Results: A respecified model using only one error covariance fit the data very well. All fit indices were within their critical values (x2/df ratio 5 1.5; CFI 5.99; TLI 5 .99; RMSEA 5 .03; SRMR 5 .03). Thus, factor analysis confirms a two-factor, 11-item model for the HRLSW scale, consisting of two subscales, clients seen as experiencing rights violations, and social problems seen as rights violations. Conclusions: This scale is a useful tool for educators, researchers, and practitioners who want to practice—or promote the practice of—social work as a human rights profession.",,"['McPherson, J.', 'Siebert, C.

Be that as it may, no one will remember German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s remarks on immigration in October of 2010 as being about anything other than immigration. We ought to remember her remarks, however, more for what she didn’t say than for what she did say. Her deliberate (?) omission of salient facts regarding the history of the guest-worker agreement between Germany and Turkey shines just a hint of light on what we reveal to be a much broader pattern of denial that we describe as playing out here in the U.S. as a form of bad political theatre between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the theatre is only meant to distract us from the reality of the Leitkultur that we now share with nearly every country in our globalized world; namely, the market. This articles describes the role of this Leitkultur as well as the role of its denial in shaping public perceptions on the issue of immigration, and offers the beginnings of a response to Slavoj Žižek‘s call for a new Leitkultur defined in a manner that transcends national borders.",,"['Ritter, S.']",https://www.academia.edu/6247451/The_Market_Multiculutralism_and_Leitkultur_Responding_to_Žižeks_Challenge_w_Sarah_Ritter_,"[{""id"": 2976, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2013/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

As more people encounter archives for scholarly and avocational research, as part of creative pursuits, or to exercise their rights as citizens to access records, the possibilities for how collections are used will continue to evolve. Archivists need to be familiar with who their users are, understand why they’re using archival collections, and engage in outreach so that they can provide excellent reference services. Reference and Access for Archives and Manuscripts outlines the various components of: providing physical, intellectual, and virtual access, acquiring reference knowledge and skills, navigating legal regulations and ethics, and designing use policies and effective outreach. Cheryl Oestreicher contextualizes how all of these components fit within other archival functions and offers strategies and detailed practices for creating comprehensive reference programs that archivists can adapt for any type of institution.

The Development and Results of a Measure of STEM Student Professional Identity,2015.0,,,,,"*Please note that the authors listed alphabetically starting with Davis contributed equally to this paper. Post-secondary education is expected to substantially contribute to the cognitive growth and professional achievement of STEM students. Yet, there is limited understanding of how STEM students develop professionally. We used the lens of self-authorship (Baxter Magolda, 1998) to develop an instrument to be used for large-scale assessment of STEM student professional identity development. Through the process of instrument development, we assessed the relationship between the level of STEM students’ perceptions of their professional identities and their educational experiences, learning preferences, and interaction with faculty comfort. Our results indicate that several proxy questions may be useful for assessing STEM student professional identity development. We also found a misalignment between students’ perception of themselves as professionals and the expectations for their actions in professional situations. We provide implications for our research and directions for on-going investigations.",,"['Nadelson, L. S.', 'McGuire, S.', 'Davis, K. A.', 'Farid, A.', 'Hardy, K.

FAR,31243,112184269,112184269,Learning to Create a Culture of Feedback,2016.0,,,,,"Abstract: Conferring with student writers one-on-one is notoriously hard to do well. Research offers guidance on what happens in a good conference, but little is known about how any teacher actually learns to do it. This interactive session will focus on research and teaching experiments addressing how teachers learn to confer. -- Conferring with student writers one-on-one is a key component of teaching writing, but it’s notoriously hard to do well. The challenges of conferring are at once practical and philosophical: We want the student to maintain authority as author of the writing, but what if he/she just says “it’s done?” We want students to do most of the talking, but what if the student isn’t talking? We want to engage with every student, but certain students seem needier than others. We want to help students, but we also want them to have experiences problem-solving on their own. And there is never, ever enough time. Research shows that conferring is an important instructional opportunity; and we have in research and practical literature good guidance on the content and conduct of individual conferences (Anderson, 2000; Calkins, Hartman, & White, 2005; Crochunis, 2009; Freedman & Katz, 1987; Glasswell, Parr, & McNaughton, 2003; McIver & Wolf, 1999; Murray, 1979). However, little is known about how any teacher actually learns to do it. This session will focus on research and teaching experiments addressing how teachers learn to confer. Attendees will have opportunities to interact directly with classroom data and discuss emerging findings about the development of conferring skills. In Part One, “Learning to Confer in Collaboration between Mentors and Interns,” a university researcher and two classroom teachers will share research focused on conferring practices of a second grade teacher, a third grade teacher, and their two classroom interns. Using Swivl devices, interns and their mentors collected audio and video data of themselves conferring during the same writer’s workshop class period. They viewed and analyzed these collaboratively with a critical partner, developing shared values and norms for conferring. These could then be taken back to writer’s workshop and built upon iteratively-- for the interns as they prepared for their own classrooms and careers, and for the mentors as they both extended their own partnership and began the following year with new interns. In Part Two, “Learning to Create a Culture of Feedback,” a university researcher and teacher educator will first share how he works with undergraduate teacher candidates to instill a value of feedback and sound practices for providing it to K-12 writers. A series of in-class experiences and field experiences helps to develop skills for conferring within a framework of understanding feedback. Then, he will discuss how that same framework informs work with more experienced teachers in a graduate course. In Part Three, attendees will have opportunities for discussion using data excerpts and example teaching materials from the two projects described. References Anderson, C. (2000).

The Development and Results of a Measure of STEM Student Professional Identity,2015.0,,,,,"*Please note that the authors listed alphabetically starting with Davis contributed equally to this paper. Post-secondary education is expected to substantially contribute to the cognitive growth and professional achievement of STEM students. Yet, there is limited understanding of how STEM students develop professionally. We used the lens of self-authorship (Baxter Magolda, 1998) to develop an instrument to be used for large-scale assessment of STEM student professional identity development. Through the process of instrument development, we assessed the relationship between the level of STEM students’ perceptions of their professional identities and their educational experiences, learning preferences, and interaction with faculty comfort. Our results indicate that several proxy questions may be useful for assessing STEM student professional identity development. We also found a misalignment between students’ perception of themselves as professionals and the expectations for their actions in professional situations. We provide implications for our research and directions for on-going investigations.",,"['Nadelson, L. S.', 'McGuire, S.', 'Davis, K. A.', 'Farid, A.', 'Hardy, K.

Expression studies of the spacer revealed that it contains the necessary sequences to confer replication-dependent transcription in partially synchronized cells in culture. Informatics analysis of the spacer uncovered a number of binding sites for specific TFs, none of which had been previously associated with this particular promoter. Each of the TFs in the promoter organizational model are also known to participate in stages of fly development that are characterized by DNA replication and/or cell division, thus providing a biologically functional rationale for an association. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the binding sites provides evidence for evolutionary conservation of the essential features of the organizational model.

But no matter how much our contemporary views may wish away the links among sex, procreation, enduring marriage, and raising children, those links persist and will persist. They reveal that the public depends on the private since both procreation and education are the result of “private” decisions.

However, the wide-ranging application of this conclusion in scholarship reveals its continued indebtedness to a theological understanding of martyrdom. Martyrdom necessarily includes the death of the martyr and the overwhelming majority of Christians have not been martyrs. Thus, in a very real sense, martyrdom is not part of Christian identity. The seeming malleability of martyrdom reveals the substitution of the martyr’s death with a theological construct that might be called 'willingness to suffer.’ This substitution is enabled by the use of 'identity,’ a term that is characterized by imprecise boundaries between categories of analysis and of practice. Enabled by this imprecision, scholarship on martyrdom has sought to recreate the Christian group identity of martyrdom on an individual level. This has lead to theses about the widespread development of Christian martyrdom based on limited evidence that perpetuates misunderstandings about intentional self-death. I propose that when studying Christian martyrdom, we intentionally isolate the theological justifications that support ‘willingness to suffer,' which are broadly inculcated in Christian self-understanding, from the act of martyrdom itself. This will allow the exploration of the comparatively rare phenomenon of martyrdom from non-theological perspectives as well closer analysis of how martyrdom's existential impact has been leveraged in Christian institution-building.",,"['Recla, M.']",,"[{""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2019/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}, {""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}, {""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2016/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 33196, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/02"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}]"

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to assess the effect of each chemical treatment on the secondary and primary structure of α-CTx MII (L10V, E11A). Of the nine decontamination methods tested, treatment with 1% (m/v) solution of the enzymatic detergent Contrex™ EZ resulted in a 76.8% decrease in α-helical content as assessed by the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, and partial peptide digestion was demonstrated using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Additionally, treatment with 6% sodium hypochlorite (m/v) resulted in 80.5% decrease in α-helical content and complete digestion of the peptide. The Contrex™ EZ treatment was repeated with three additional α-conotoxins (α-CTxs), α-CTxs LvIA, ImI and PeIA, which verified the decontamination method was reasonably robust. These results support the use of either 1% Contrex™ EZ solution or 6% sodium hypochlorite in biosafety protocols for the decontamination of α-CTxs in research laboratories.",,"['Turner, M.

An emergent approach to new drug development is drug repurposing, in which compounds that have already gone through some level of clinical testing are examined for efficacy against diseases divergent than their original application. Repurposing of existing drugs circumvents the time and considerable cost of early stages of drug development, and can be accelerated by using software to screen existing chemical databases to identify suitable drug candidates. Results: Small-molecule Peptide-Influenced Drug Repurposing (SPIDR) was developed to identify small molecule drugs that target a specific receptor by exploring the conformational binding space of peptide ligands. SPIDR was tested using the potent and selective 16-amino acid peptide α-conotoxin MII ligand and the α3β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) isoform. SPIDR incorporates a genetic algorithm-based, heuristic search procedure, which was used to explore the ligand binding domain of the α3β2-nAChR isoform using a library consisting of 640,000 α-conotoxin MII peptide analogs. The peptides that exhibited the highest affinity for α3β2-nAChR were used as models for a small-molecule structure similarity search of the PubChem Compound database. SPIDR incorporates the SimSearcher utility, which generates shape distribution signatures of molecules and employs multi-level K-means clustering to insure fast database queries. SPIDR identified non-peptide drugs with estimated binding affinities nearly double that of the native α-conotoxin MII peptide. Conclusions: SPIDR has been generalized and integrated into DockoMatic v 2.1. This software contains an intuitive graphical interface for peptide mutant screening workflow and facilitates mapping, clustering, and searching of local molecular databases, making DockoMatic a valuable tool for researchers in drug design and repurposing.

Their toxicity manifests as gastrointestinal symptoms followed by a Bezold- Jarisch reflex: hypopnea, hypotension and bradycardia. Some Veratrum steroidal alkaloids are also teratogens interfering with the hedgehog-2 signaling pathway, which causes cyclopsia and holoprosencephaly. We present a case of accidental poisoning from V. parviflorum mistaken for the edible Allium tricoccum (ramps, wild leek). Case history: A 27 year old man and his 25 year old wife presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and bradycardia after foraging and ingesting plants that they believed to be a local native species of wild leek. Methods: We collected and analyzed the implicated fresh plant material and both patients’ serum/plasma. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray ionization time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to extract and characterize steroidal alkaloids from the foraged plant and patients’ serum. Results: Our V. parviflorum samples contained verazine, veratramine, veratridine, and cyclopamine. Discussion: Steroidal alkaloids have been previously isolated from V. viride and V. album and toxicity has been reported mainly from V. album species. This is the first reported case of Veratrum toxicity from V. parviflorum with identified steroidal alkaloids. Conclusion: V. parviflorum toxicity manifests with gastrointestinal and cardiac symptoms. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive as with previous case reports of toxicity with other Veratrum species.",,"['Anwar, M.', 'Turner, M. W.', 'Farrell, N.', 'Zomlefer, W. B.', 'McDougal, O.

Here we provide a detailed analysis of the alkaloid composition of V. californicum by plant part through quantitative analysis of cyclopamine, veratramine, muldamine and isorubijervine in the leaf, stem and root/rhizome of the plant. To determine whether additional alkaloids in the extracts contribute to Hh signaling inhibition, the concentrations of these four alkaloids present in extracts were replicated using commercially available standards, followed by comparison of extracts to alkaloid standard mixtures for inhibition of Hh signaling using Shh-Light II cells. Alkaloid combinations enhanced Hh signaling pathway antagonism compared to cyclopamine alone, and significant differences were observed in the Hh pathway inhibition between the stem and root/rhizome extracts and their corresponding alkaloid standard mixtures, indicating that additional alkaloids present in these extracts are capable of inhibiting Hh signaling.",,"['Turner, M.

The α3β2-nAChR isoform is a model receptor system for the α6α4β2β3-nAChR isoform shown to degrade in Parkinson’s patients. It has been previously reported that binding of ligand agonists to the α3β2-nAChR isoform, such as nicotine, trigger the biological response of neuronal receptor up-regulation and reduction of proteasomal subunit degradation. In order to identify ligands that induce a favorable biological response, this study investigates the relative binding energies of three α-conotoxins (α-CTxs): native α-CTx MII, and two mutant variants, MII[E11A] and MII[N5R:E11A:H12K]. Two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was used to determined IC50 values for α-CTx MII and mutants. The IC50 values were 0.425, 0.996, and 7.75 nM for α-CTx MII, MII[E11A], and MII[N5R:E11A:H12K], respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to these systems to explore the energetics and dynamics of α-CTx interaction with nAChRs. The MII[N5R:E11A:H12K] mutant had a relative binding free energy (∆∆Gbind) of -7.29 kcal mol-1 compared to the relative binding free energy of MII[E11A] which was 1.93 kcal mol-1. Despite the greater predicted binding affinity for the MII[N5R:E11A:H12K] mutant, TEV experiments showed that this ligand only induced approximately 60% blockage of α3β2-nAChR.",,"['Walker, S.

Post-secondary education is expected to substantially contribute to the cognitive growth and professional achievement of STEM students. Yet, there is limited understanding of how STEM students develop professionally. We used the lens of self-authorship (Baxter Magolda, 1998) to develop an instrument to be used for large-scale assessment of STEM student professional identity development. Through the process of instrument development, we assessed the relationship between the level of STEM students’ perceptions of their professional identities and their educational experiences, learning preferences, and interaction with faculty comfort. Our results indicate that several proxy questions may be useful for assessing STEM student professional identity development. We also found a misalignment between students’ perception of themselves as professionals and the expectations for their actions in professional situations. We provide implications for our research and directions for on-going investigations.",,"['Nadelson, L. S.', 'McGuire, S.', 'Davis, K. A.', 'Farid, A.', 'Hardy, K.

In particular, the increasing presence of Border Patrol has contributed to environmental degradation in wilderness. Complicated human rights concerns are also explored in the book. Protecting wildlife in an area with high rates of undocumented border-crossing and smuggling results in complex and sometimes controversial conservation policies. Ultimately, the observations and analysis presented in this book illustrate ways in which the politics of race and nationalism are subtly, but significantly, interwoven into border environmental and security policies.",,"['Meierotto, L.']",https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030318130,"[{""id"": 36055, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 36055, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 36055, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2017/02"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 36055, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2016/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}]"

Examiner judgments showed a slight truth bias with 61.8% of the true confessions correctly identified, but with 52% of the false confessions also believed. A believability index developed from judgments and confidence did not show a significant difference between true and false confessions. However examiners with the Reid interrogation training found false confessions more believable than true confessions. Examiners without Reid training produced the opposite pattern. Our results suggest that Reid training is detrimental when assessing the credibility of juvenile confessions. As with adults, a high degree of caution in evaluating the credibility of confessions given by juveniles is warranted.",,"['Honts Ph. D., C.

This periodic pressurization controls the timing of explosive events, which nearly always occur at peak inflation, as detected with short baseline tiltmeters. The tilt cycles observed in January 2012 reveal striking 26 +/-6 min cycles of inflation and deflation corresponding to at least 104 kg of gas fluxing the system each cycle (~101 kg/s). Very long period (VLP) earthquakes presage explosions and occur during those tilt cycles for which inflation rates are most rapid. These VLPs locate ~300 m below the vent and indicate initial mobilization of volatiles, which ascend at about 50 m/s. Rapid ascent feeds pyroclast-laden explosive eruptions lasting up to several minutes and rising more than one kilometer. VLPs are not typically observed during less rapid inflation episodes; instead, gas vents passively through the conduit producing no infrasound and no explosion. These observations intimate that steady gas exsolution and accumulation in a shallow reservoir drives inflation cycles at open-vent silicic volcano.",,"['Johnson, J.', 'Lyons, J.', 'Andrews, B.', 'Lees, J.']",,"[{""id"": 3648, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This debate has been largely uninformed by research findings. This study fills this gap using quantitative and qualitative data collected via surveys in a large undergraduate victimology course to explore student attitudes toward trigger warnings. Findings revealed considerable, but nuanced support for trigger warning use in victimology courses. Support does not appear to differ between crime victims and non-victims; support is higher among females than males. These findings underscore that universal decisions mandating or advocating for or against the use of trigger warnings are premature. Further study is needed with a diverse range of samples to gain a fuller picture of student attitudes about trigger warnings as well as to assess any impact of trigger warnings use on student behavior and learning.",,"['Cares, A.', 'Franklin, C.', 'Fisher, B.', 'Growette Bostaph, L.

Yet, we have an imperfect understanding of the mechanisms by which this occurs. Group learning may mediate student stress by placing learning in a context where students have both social support and greater control over their learning. We hypothesize that one of the methods by which small group activities improve learning is by mitigating student stress. To test this, we collected physiological measures of stress and self-reported perceived stress from 26 students in two undergraduate classes. Salivary cortisol and testosterone were measured within students across five contexts: a) pre-instructional baseline, b) following a traditional lecture, c) after participating in a structured small group learning activity, d) following completion of multiple choice, and e) essay sections of an exam. Results indicate students have lower salivary cortisol after small group learning activities, as compared to traditional lectures. Further, there is no evidence of a relationship between physiological measures of stress and self-reported perceived stress levels. We discuss how structured small group activities may be beneficial for reducing stress and improving student learning outcomes.",,"['Snopkowski, K.', 'Demps, K.', 'Scaggs, S.', 'Griffiths, R.', 'Fulk, K.

Post-secondary education is expected to substantially contribute to the cognitive growth and professional achievement of STEM students. Yet, there is limited understanding of how STEM students develop professionally. We used the lens of self-authorship (Baxter Magolda, 1998) to develop an instrument to be used for large-scale assessment of STEM student professional identity development. Through the process of instrument development, we assessed the relationship between the level of STEM students’ perceptions of their professional identities and their educational experiences, learning preferences, and interaction with faculty comfort. Our results indicate that several proxy questions may be useful for assessing STEM student professional identity development. We also found a misalignment between students’ perception of themselves as professionals and the expectations for their actions in professional situations. We provide implications for our research and directions for on-going investigations.",,"['Nadelson, L. S.', 'McGuire, S.', 'Hardy, K. K.', 'Davis, K.

Reacting to the perceived moral judgement in earlier scholarship about the abnormality of martyrdom, the 'identity approach’ grounds martyrdom instead in the socio-cultural self-construction of early Christians. However, in interpreting martyrdom primarily as a discourse for identity construction, this approach neglects the existential phenomenon of the martyr. Maintaining the existential implications of martyrdom is critical to anchor discussion of martyrdom as a Christian identity discourse, specifically to understand the gap between the ideological function of martyr discourse—for early Christians and early Christian scholars—and the comparatively infrequent occurrence of martyrdom. Given the early Christian martyr’s pride of place in most common understandings of martyrdom and the present-day persistence of actual martyr-making in many ideological domains, relevant scholarship must attend to what made the martyr individually as well as how martyrdom constituted a form of identity discourse for early Christians. This approach will contribute to our understanding of the dialectical relationship between the phenomenon of martyrdom as identity and as event, as well as challenging the implicit theological claim—and cultural assumption—that religious belief alone makes the martyr.",,"['Recla, M.

Esta novela de Flavio Herrera fue publicada en 1932 y desde entonces ha sido leída por la crítica principalmente como una novela telúrica que forma parte del movimiento criollista. Si bien es cierto que esta obra demuestra varias tendencias de la novela telúrica, hasta el momento la crítica apenas ha comentado la evidente influencia del vanguardismo que se manifiesta en ella. Por lo tanto, en este estudio destacaré los elementos estéticos en El tigre que provienen de los movimientos vanguardistas de Europa y las Américas a principios del siglo veinte y resaltaré la importancia de esta estética para un análisis hermenéutico de la novela.

The 1,032-page volume left Melville’s library following his death in 1891. It was discovered in the 1930s, subsequently lost, and rediscovered in 1999. Twice rebound and missing its original endpapers (and therefore, most likely, Melville's usual ownership inscription), the extremely brittle volume has been photographed by Houghton Library and digitized at Melville’s Marginalia Online. Along with following the historian’s account of English literature from the Eleventh Century to the poetry of the Reformation, Melville’s markings and annotations reveal his preoccupation with Warton’s attention to subjects “almost unknown to the general reader.” His marginalia gravitate uncannily to Warton’s discussions of lost works, dispersals of libraries, works rescued from oblivion, languages and writings concealed by ecclesiastical dictates, banned writings, and esoteric modes of literary expression—all topics with deep aesthetic and biographical connections to Melville's own writings and to his failed career as a popular author. The book also contains marginalia on writers Melville had already studied in still-surviving volumes, such as his copies of Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton, whose works had profoundly influenced his own writings, as well as unique marginalia on now-forgotten writers excerpted by Warton, and by whom no works owned by Melville are known to survive. Dating deep within the period of reputational decline that followed his failure as a marketable writer, when he closely studied works of poetry and criticism while quietly pursuing his own sophisticated efforts in verse, Melville’s marginalia in Warton’s History of English Poetry offer an unparalleled look into an obscure but artistically fertile period of his life and thought.",,"['Olsen-Smith, S.

FAR,38399,111110323,111110323,Creating a STEM Identity: Investment with Return,2014.0,American Society for Engineering Education,,,,"Creating a STEM Identity: Investment with Return Establishing a strong STEM identity on this metropolitan campus has been an important step toward creating a climate conducive to facilitating fundamental change. Examples of such change include building collaborations among faculty within and across departments,establishing the identity of students as part of a community beyond their chosen major,improving the efficiency and effectiveness of university systems, and perhaps most importantly in higher education, developing a framework to think very purposefully about ways to effect change. The College of Engineering on this metropolitan campus began focusing heavily on student success initiatives in 2004 with support from the Engineering Schools of the West Initiative, through The Hewlett Foundation. This first wave of initiatives was critically assessed,and engineering student success became a focal point for the College of Engineering. Internal research conducted under this grant exposed numerous roadblocks that impeded students' academic success, particularly in the mathematics sequence. In 2010, another large grant, funded through the National Science Foundation Science Talent Expansion Program, was awarded to help focus on increasing the numbers of students graduating with STEM degrees. This grant engaged an interdisciplinary, cross-college team of educators passionate about continuous improvement and pedagogical reform. All activities associated with this grant were deliberately categorized as “STEM” activities, in order to further unify the STEM community and its sense of common purpose. Within approximately one year of the STEP grant's launch, a second grant was awarded, a NSF Innovation through Institutional Integration grant. This paper discusses and presents supporting data to show how creating a STEM identity has been a critical step towards cross-curricular integration and improvements in pedagogical training. Structures and policies have changed on campus. Across campus, educational research and curriculum collaboration is expanding. Information distribution to STEM majors has changed, and a sense of STEM community and culture has emerged.",,"['Callahan, J.', 'Pyke, P.', 'Shadle, S.', 'Landrum, R.

While still a challenge for student writers, dissonance now takes different forms, particularly for advanced student writers who embrace theories of revision but struggle to implement the practices. Unspoken, these experiences of dissonance become internalized as fear-based narratives and scripts that negatively impact student writers. This study provides insight into the ways in which students navigate the dissonance by adapting, or re-scripting, their fear into a productive element of writing and revision. To better understand the interplay of strategy and struggle, we argue that revision pedagogies for advanced student writers must take the emotional work of revision into consideration.",,"['Myers, K.', 'Ballenger, B.']",,"[{""id"": 38566, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 38566, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

The Development and Results of a Measure of STEM Student Professional Identity,2016.0,,,,,"*Please note that the authors listed alphabetically starting with Davis contributed equally to this paper. Post-secondary education is expected to substantially contribute to the cognitive growth and professional achievement of STEM students. Yet, there is limited understanding of how STEM students develop professionally. We used the lens of self-authorship (Baxter Magolda, 1998) to develop an instrument to be used for large-scale assessment of STEM student professional identity development. Through the process of instrument development, we assessed the relationship between the level of STEM students’ perceptions of their professional identities and their educational experiences, learning preferences, and interaction with faculty comfort. Our results indicate that several proxy questions may be useful for assessing STEM student professional identity development. We also found a misalignment between students’ perception of themselves as professionals and the expectations for their actions in professional situations. We provide implications for our research and directions for on-going investigations.",,"['Nadelson, L. S.', 'McGuire, S.', 'Davis, K. A.', 'Farid, A.', 'Hardy, K.

To address this polygyny paradox, we generalize the standard polygyny threshold model to a mutual mate choice model predicting the fraction of women married polygynously. We then demonstrate two conditions that are jointly sufficient to make monogamy the predominant marriage form, even in highly unequal societies. We assess if these conditions are satisfied using individual-level data from 29 human populations. Our analysis shows that with the shift to stratified agricultural economies: (i) the population frequency of relatively poor individuals increased, increasing wealth inequality, but decreasing the frequency of individuals with sufficient wealth to secure polygynous marriage, and (ii) diminishing marginal fitness returns to additional wives prevent extremely wealthy men from obtaining as many wives as their relative wealth would otherwise predict. These conditions jointly lead to a high population-level frequency of monogamy.",,"['Ross, C. T.', 'Borgerhoff Mulder, M.', 'Oh, S.

The study investigated (1) the effectiveness of using a systematically sequenced and managed, self-paced e-learning program, ALEKS, on academic performance of students with different learning styles, and (2) the relationship among the students' dominant learning styles, motivational characteristics, and overall performance in the Precalculus class. Students in the experimental group, consisting of 2 of the 4 sections of the course, were assigned to complete ALEKS as homework assignments throughout the semester. Students in the control group, consisting of the other 2 sections of the course, completed a series of traditional paper-and-pencil homework assignments instead. Students' dominant learning styles were measured by Gregorc Style Delineator™. Their motivational orientations and learning strategies were measured with the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. A pre-test and a post-test, measuring students' entry- and exit-knowledge levels in Precalculus, were administered in both experimental and control groups at the beginning and at the end of the semester. This study revealed that sequential-type students who used ALEKS outperformed sequential-type students who completed handout homework assignments and random-type students who used ALEKS or handout homework assignments by one letter grade, although this difference was not statistically significant. Several instructional implications related to students' learning styles, motivational characteristics, and academic performance are discussed. Especially, students with a dominant abstract-random style may need more tailored learning support to be more successful in a Precalculus class.",,"['Chyung, S. Y.', 'Callahan, J.

A spate of recent court cases pose these emerging legal questions, about which little scholarly work has been written: Who retains control of a social media account an employee uses both personally and for the employer’s benefit? When an employee leaves the firm, who keeps the valuable contacts and business relationships created through it? How should courts parse the personal from the professional? The law remains unanchored, and courts, confused. This Article focuses on the right of continued post-employment access to mixed-use social media accounts. It argues that to date, litigants, courts, and commentators have miscast this issue, blurring it with a panoply of ill-fitting legal theories, from trade secret to conversion. At the core of these cases is the right to control a social media profile and to continue to interact with its audience, a desire inextricably intertwined with an individual’s personality and work product. Taking into account relevant business and social science literature on social media, this Article argues that reasoning grounded in publicity rights provides a better lens through which to view an employee’s social media activity: Individuals should be entitled to protection against those who seek to misappropriate their work, personae, and goodwill for economic gain, except when their work falls squarely in the scope of their employment. On that basis, it proposes an analysis that balances the employee’s professional and dignitary interests against the employer’s commercial concerns.",,"['Park, S.', 'Abril, P.']",,"[{""id"": 396, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 396, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2015/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

FAR,400,111112978,111112978,Unauthorized Televised Debate Footage in Political Campaign Advertising: Fair Use and the DMC,2013.0,,,,,"In recent years television networks which air political campaign debates have attempted to enforce their copyright protection by denying the use of debate footage in subsequent campaign advertising. Although some campaigns have complied with network demands to omit the footage from campaign ads, others have relied upon a fair use or free speech argument to defy the networks and use the footage without permission. The success of this defense will vary drastically, depending upon the medium. Ads run on television are subject to traditional copyright law that requires the copyright holder to affirmatively assert a claim of copyright infringement. Although several networks have threatened legal action, no court has yet determined whether such ads are indeed a fair use of the copyrighted material. When political campaigns upload ads for viewing on the Internet through sites such as YouTube, the process set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) gives the networks the ability to takedown allegedly infringing content almost immediately, without first showing that the material infringes upon an existing copyright. This use of the DMCA has the effect of chilling important political speech, especially in a rapid campaign cycle. This article analyzes this issue, showing first that the use of campaign debate footage is indeed a fair use, and then reviewing and critiquing various proposals for reform of the DMCA. Part II of this article presents the factual backdrop upon which this issue must be analyzed. Part III discusses traditional copyright protection and the fair use exception. It also explores the intersection of copyright law and the important free speech issues these cases present. Part IV analyzes the fair use defense as applied to this situation and suggests the likely outcome, should such a case ever go to trial. Part V discusses the related topic of the DMCA as it applies to internet service providers (ISPs) such as YouTube and explains how a holding of fair use could have important implications for political speech on the Internet. It suggests that a holding in favor of making debate footage available for all candidates to use in political advertising is essential to ensuring full and fair debate of ideas and issues within the political process. Part VI concludes.",,"['Park, S.']",,"[{""id"": 400, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2012/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

However, there was no significant difference regarding students’ attitudes toward science, engineering, and technology before and after their eight-week participation. The discourse analysis of weekly video recordings of students while participating in two PBL projects revealed a range of complexity and variation of CT in students.

American economic history has long been defined by the classic, waveform narrative of nineteenth-century industrialization, urbanization, and capitalist expansion followed by twentieth-century deindustrialization, globalization, and urban decay. Manufacturing Catastrophe, however, argues that this foundational mythology is deeply flawed. It shows that industrial Massachusetts did not simply “rise” and “fall,” but was made and re-made over and over again, beset by incessant waves of economic collapse and reconstruction. Tracing the successive rise and fall of the Massachusetts whaling, textile, garment, electronics, and high-tech industries over the past 200 years, it shows how Massachusetts business, labor, and political leaders repeatedly mobilized the lure of crisis itself—in everything from cheap labor and slashed tax rates to low rents and high manufacturing subsidies—to pull and push both capital and workers across the continents. Economic catastrophe was skillfully mobilized by business leaders and policymakers to shift the geography of global capitalism to repeatedly rebuild the state's shattered economy. Crisis was, unexpectedly, a critical ingredient in the making of American industrial hegemony. To that end, Manufacturing Catastrophe suggests that the mad scramble for globally mobile capital—the so-called ""race to the bottom""—is not some unique new problem that affluent nations alone face. As the Massachusetts case shows, it was part and parcel of the global spread of industrial capitalism itself, stretching back to the nineteenth century. Policymakers often use these tactics of capitalist seduction to ensnare runaway industries and and lure global capital. From the perspective of Massachusetts, these are time-tested tools to foster short-term growth and cannibalize long-term prosperity.",,"['Nichols, S.

FAR,42593,114002257,114002257,“The History of Education is the History of Writing:” Education and Cultural Techniques.,2019.0,,,,,"Histories of educational theories, forms and practices have traditionally focused on canonical texts and terms, often beginning with those of Hellenic Greece. Looking at current textbook histories (e.g., Murphy, 2005; Gutek 2010), one might be forgiven for thinking that educational achievements began with Plato’s Academy or Isocrates’ Paideia. However, in recent years, other scholars have highlighted the accomplishments of non-western cultures, such as those of the Ottoman Empire (Hirschler 2012) or traditional China (Lee 2000). Looking to the ancient Middle East, this paper considers the ways in which the practices and techniques that we still associate with education and schooling—particularly in its most basal forms—have been manifest in very different times and places. In so doing, it seeks to challenge established albeit largely implicit histories of education, narratives that locate the origins of educational practices and techniques in the biology of the human brain (e.g., Metzloff 2009), or in the non- or pre-literate phenomena of apprenticeship (Lave and Wenger 1991) or histories of terms and ideas (Gutek 2010).",,"['Friesen, N.']",,"[{""id"": 42593, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2021/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 42593, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

However, in recent months, Silicon Valley defectors and some education technologists have warned that these technologies enact a form of Skinnerian operant conditioning.

For example, drawing from Aristotelian and Arendtian sources (respectively), scholars have defined teacher manner as “conduct expressive of dispositions or traits” associated with “virtue” and teacher authenticity as the unity of “teachers’ personal and professional selves.” This paper proposes the adaptation of two rather different frameworks or heuristics from the continental pedagogical tradition to a similar end: Namely to show how “pedagogical tact” (pädagogischer Takt) and the “pedagogical triangle” (didaktischer Dreieck; Triangle pédagogique) can be used as analytical, heuristic devices to help bring aspects of moral teaching to visibility.",,"['Friesen, N.', 'Osguthorpe, R.

Researchers have studied the effectiveness of writing center consultation in improving their writing skills, but no validated instrument to collect data from students exists. This article seeks to create just such an instrument. Methods: Following panel review, proposed scale items were administered to 357 undergraduate and graduate students who visited the writing center over a period of two months. An exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the identification of a usable set of questions. Results: Content validity was established conceptually and through expert panel review. Factor analyses supported a 13-item measure representing a single dimension. The items for the model shows both strong theoretical and statistical support.

Post-secondary education is expected to substantially contribute to the cognitive growth and professional achievement of STEM students. Yet, there is limited understanding of how STEM students develop professionally. We used the lens of self-authorship (Baxter Magolda, 1998) to develop an instrument to be used for large-scale assessment of STEM student professional identity development. Through the process of instrument development, we assessed the relationship between the level of STEM students’ perceptions of their professional identities and their educational experiences, learning preferences, and interaction with faculty comfort. Our results indicate that several proxy questions may be useful for assessing STEM student professional identity development. We also found a misalignment between students’ perception of themselves as professionals and the expectations for their actions in professional situations. We provide implications for our research and directions for on-going investigations.",,"['Nadelson, L. S.', 'McGuire, S.', 'Davis, K. A.', 'Farid, A.', 'Hardy, K.

Intriguingly, fortilin protects cells against ROS-induced cell death, independent of p53. The signaling pathway through which fortilin protects cells against ROS-induced cell death, however, is unknown. Here we report that fortilin physically interacts with the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin-1 (PRX1), protects it from proteasome-mediated degradation, and keeps it enzymatically active by blocking its deactivating phosphorylation by Mst1, a serine/threonine kinase. At the whole animal level, the liver-specific overexpression of fortilin reduced PRX1 phosphorylation in the liver, enhanced PRX1 activity, and protected the transgenic animals against alcohol-induced, ROS-mediated, liver damage. These data suggest the presence of a novel oxidative-stress-handling pathway where the anti-p53 molecule fortilin augments the peroxidase PRX1 by protecting it against degradation and inactivation of the enzyme. Fortilin-PRX1 interaction in the liver could be clinically exploited further to prevent acute alcohol-induced liver damage in humans.",,"['McDougal, O.

Recently the basic tenets of United States grand strategy have come under increased scrutiny. Some argue that the US can no longer afford to maintain its global military presence. Others argue that the United States remains entirely capable of maintaining these relationships, further arguing that the United States' military primacy actually yields substantial gains. However, the precise nature of these extended benefits remains unclear. In this paper, we find that the US security relationships have facilitated greater global economic integration.

Most studies on this issue rely on aggregated data on public attitudes towards the U.S., or on anecdotal accounts of high-profile crimes or other incidents involving U.S. military personnel. Using new cross-national survey data from 14 countries, we examine how different forms of exposure to a U.S. military presence in a country affect attitudes towards the U.S. military, government, and people. Notably, these surveys provide nationally representative samples across traditional covariates like age, income, and gender. We find that contact with U.S. military personnel or the receipt of economic benefits from the U.S. presence increases support for the U.S. presence, people, and government.

FAR,45071,112139145,112139145,"Primitivism and Prostitution in Claude McKay's ""Romance in Marseille""",2020.0,,,,,"After accepting my essay and waiting for nearly a year, the organizer, co editor rejected it. It is really unfair, but that is life in academic publishing. Male Bonding versus Sympathy for Women: The Place of Aslima in Claude McKay’s “Romance in Marseille” “Prostitutes stand not at the periphery of modern society, but at its dead center. They personify the complex interplay between bright fantasies of solidly established tradition and the dark, sullen acceptance of human ignorance.” (Reid-Pharr 125) If Claude McKay’s commitment to homosocial and homosexual bonds between men outweighs his interest in a heterosexual love plot in Banjo, heterosexual romance plots with relatively happy endings do characterize Home to Harlem and Banana Bottom. Similarly, while Jean-Christophe’s dismissal of Seraphine Peixota’s efforts to attract Almaya in Amiable with Big Teeth as “dimwit romance” seems warranted, it is nonetheless true that the romance between Almaya and Gloria Kendall is more than a second-best consolation for the Ethiopian diplomat (Amiable xiv, 247). McKay offers an ironic twist to such plotting in his ending to “Romance in Marseille.” At the same time, the novel offers a surprising glimpse into the inner life of Aslima, the love interest of the protagonist Lafala, when she experiences her vision in Chapter 11 (“Romance” 75-79). It seems essential to the plot that the vision occurs after she leaves her pimp Titin and before she makes her way to see Lafala at his hotel. On the one hand McKay deftly imagines his way in to the experience of others, but on the other he often remains at a deliberate distance from the inner lives of his characters. The speakers of “Harlem Shadows” and “Harlem Dancer” sympathize with prostitutes enough to identify with them and care about their plight in a “stern harsh world” that “Has pushed [their] timid little feet of clay” into poverty (Collected 162). In “Midnight Woman to the Bobby,” McKay even impersonates a streetwalker who adamantly defends herself against the depredations of a policeman (Collected 51-52). By contrast, the characters in “Romance in Marseille,” as in Banjo and Home to Harlem, take sex work for granted and the men wage a war between the sexes in order to protect their self-interest. Although Ray shares a moment of unity with Latnah when they smoke opium together in Banjo (282-84), Banjo easily dismisses her at the end of that novel, explicitly preferring the male bonds between himself and Ray. As Michelle Stephens has asked, “Why is Latnah’s absence necessary to the resolution of the black transnational romance? Why is she forfeited in the masculine quest for racial freedom? (168). While Aslima’s ultimate abandonment parallels that of Latnah, in “Romance in Marseille” Lafala really does seem to love Aslima and they experience a genuine harmony together for an extended period of time. By contrast, McKay’s treatment of sex work in “The Beast” (1920) is rendered almost allegorically, in schematic ideological terms: Down in its shops and offices and streets The toilers struggle, sullen, underpaid, And pinch-faced poverty proud Plutus meets, And pimps and harlots ply their wretched trade. And in its gorgeous halls where gold holds sway The smirking mother offers her young daughter To haughty men for whom all women are play Or babes, or ornaments, or sheep for slaughter: Its system makes men parasites or brutes And tends to make all women prostitutes. (Collected 133) In “Romance,” McKay individuates Aslima so that she stands out of the mass of “harlots” in Marseille. The inevitability of the bond between “brutes” and “prostitutes” in “The Beast” is not as evident in “Romance” until the final scene of the novel. Nonetheless, Lafala’s final decision to abandon her keeps his autonomy intact by surrendering Aslima to what turns out to be a violent end at the hands of her white pimp. It is unclear if the novel’s outcome proves the truth of Aslima’s vision, given the centrality of the flaming sword in it (“Romance” 75-77). While the vision identifies the sword with life, it is also an instrument of death and division. In addition, it parallels Latnah’s dagger in Banjo. In a suicidal gesture, moreover, Aslima herself pulls a knife on Titin at the end of Romance, which drives him to shoot her to death. Wayne Cooper writes that Aslima “annihilates” Lafala at the end of the story. He is presumably referring to an earlier draft of the manuscript, so it seems significant that Lafala abandons her and Titin kills her in the last version of McKay’s novel (267). The relatively sympathetic treatment of Aslima is remarkably different from the more generally negative depictions of women in Home to Harlem and Banjo, although it is nowhere near the fully sympathetic rendering of Bita Plant in Banana Bottom. McKay makes Bita the star of her story: she enjoys the same narrative spotlight as Jake in Home and Lincoln Agrippa Daily in Banjo. But she is not a prostitute. The irony of “Romance” distills the harsh realism of the first two novels, but it also reflects greater sympathy with at least one woman. If the sympathy for prostitutes in the poems is often romanticized and the figurations of Latnah and Aslima decidedly Orientalized, it is nonetheless true that McKay offers compelling portraits of women in Banana Bottom and “Romance in Marseille.” In an article addressing Banjo, Leah Rosenberg argues that “McKay sets the primitive in almost binary opposition to prostitution” (225). From another standpoint, Smita Das focuses on mixed-race women in Banjo and Banana Bottom, concluding that “For McKay, the Afro-Asian body functions as a site of a struggle that needs to be accounted for in transnational and national contexts” (721). In “Romance in Marseille,” Lafala and Aslima seem to embrace their primal instincts through the pig discourse they employ to characterize their sexual interactions, which might suggest a provisional resolution to the conflicts identified by Rosenberg and Das. (Not incidentally, Aslima’s exuberant pig discourse and pig dance at Tout-va-Bien repudiate religious and social attitudes toward swine as ritually unclean, taboo animals [“Romance” 47-48].) However, since Lafala is fully African and Aslima is another example of the “Afro-Asian” female body, the final outcome of “Romance” seems to conform to the symbolic pattern of struggle Das sees at work in Banjo and Banana Bottom. Because of uncertainty about her true motivations and allegiance, Aslima apparently both mediates Lafala’s return home and provides a barrier to his return. As a fellow African, she shares an ancestral heritage with him, but as part Arab and female sex worker, she poses a threat to Lafala, at least in the eyes of his male companions. According to Gary Holcomb, when Lafala accepts the view of other men and decides to abandon Aslima, he fails to understand love, whereas Aslima takes on the operatic grandeur of a tragic heroine when Titin kills her (222). For Holcomb, Aslima ultimately emerges as the protagonist; the novel “is more her legend than anyone else’s” (224). This may feel true to many readers of the novel—and in a letter of March 1930 McKay himself confessed to feeling that Aslima was “running away with the book and me” (Cooper 267). In the cultural logics of Rosenberg and Das, however, McKay’s decision to end his story with a solitary Lafala returning to his home in Africa seems to reaffirm the conflicts between prostitute and primitive on the one hand and African and mixed-race Asian-African on the other. According to those cultural logics, Aslima’s personal heroism would seem to be unavailing. At the same time, by providing such rich contexts for Aslima’s part in Lafala’s story, McKay makes his readers feel the sting of Lafala’s abandonment and the shock of her brutally violent death. Since Aslima is depicted as an embodiment of Africa in Lafala’s imagination (“Romance” 5), the fact that he separates himself from her is contradictory. For this reason it is surprising that he abandons her in the end. Since he planned to take her with him up until the night before his departure, his volte-face seems unaccountable, or at least precipitous. However, in light of the ending of Banjo and the privileging of male bonds over heterosexual ones in Banjo and even in Home to Harlem, the end may seem less surprising. “Romance in Marseille” fits in with Das’s view of Banjo. But it would also seem to belie the dramatic vision experienced by Aslima and the enduring love shared by her and Lafala until his departure. This gives the novel an unsettling, even unfinished quality. But the abrupt change of plans on Lafala’s part is treated with great drama from Aslima’s perspective, if not Lafala’s. In “Romance,” McKay offers a complex picture of black transnationalism and gender relations. Perhaps one of the strengths of the novel is that it does not resolve the conflicts associated with either. Works Cited Cooper, Wayne. Claude McKay: Rebel Sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance.

Demographics of college students are shifting and presenting campuses with new opportunities to serve differently prepared students. Meanwhile, higher education is under pressure to reduce budgets, and serve more students, within certain areas of the university including the library, academic advising, and other student services. . Undergraduate students have new expectations for their college experience, including immediate gainful employment, which is their primary definition of success. Academic librarians and student success administrators can collaborate, and together they can create additional pathways for students who struggle to succeed. This book intends to provide a roadmap for library employees and student success administrators to initiate and develop discussions on college campuses to define, then address these student needs. These needs are emergent, and while all of these students need more services and support, these services must be tailored based on regional needs. Through a selection of case studies, and historical context, readers will learn how to define what student success looks like in their units and design custom services to address student barriers to that success. The primary audience for this book is academic library employees and student success professionals. Academic library employees include front-line staff, librarians, managers, and administrators. On-campus student success professionals include advisors and student counselors, as well as administrators. These two main audiences-- library employees and student success professionals—share a common cause of serving students at the margins of college campus demographics. These readers will acquire skills to enhance student success initiatives and strengthen collaborations with one another? A tertiary group of potential collaborators includes higher education employees from student success programs such as TrIO, academic affairs, admissions, and student retention.",,"['Vecchione, A.

In order to increase interoperability, real-time availability of data, and flexibility, information/communication technologies are adopted in this domain. While these information technologies have been effective, they are integrated into operational technologies without the necessary security defense. Designing an effective, layered security defense is not possible unless security threats are identified through a structural analysis of the ICS. For that reason, this paper provides an attacker's point of view on the reconnaissance effort necessary to gather details of the system dynamics - which are required for the development of sophisticated attacks. We present a reconnaissance approach which uses the system's I/O data to infer the dynamic model of the system. In this effort, we propose a novel cyber-attack which targets the controller proportional-integral-derivative gain values in a constant setpoint control system. Our findings will help researchers design more secure control systems.",,"['Tylor, P.', 'Mehrpouyan, H.', 'Gardner, J.

In this work, eight compositions within the CaTi1-xFexO3-x/2 system and eleven compositions within the SrTi1-xFexO3-x/2 system were synthesized using a conventional solid-oxide mixing procedure. Using a data-mining approach, these data were supplemented with data from five more published oxygen-deficient systems.

This project allowed archives staff to experiment with a range of minimal through item-level methods to arrange and describe the collection.

FAR,4747,111643332,111643332,"The Inscription of Walt Whitman's ""Live Oak, with Moss"" Sequence: A Restorative Edition",2012.0,,,,,"Walt Whitman's twelve-poem ""Live Oak, with Moss"" sequence, composed in the late 1850s then broken up and dispersed by the poet among thirty-three other poems for the ""Calamus"" cluster of the third (1860) edition of Leaves of Grass, was first printed in 1953 by Fredson Bowers and is now available in several literature anthologies and collections of Whitman's writings. [1]http://scholarlyediting.org/2012/editions/intro.liveoakwithmoss.html#note1""> Apparently inspired by a failed same-sex attachment and its psychological aftermath, ""Live Oak, with Moss"" was neglected for forty years after Bowers reassembled the sequence from Whitman's surviving manuscripts for the 1860 Leaves. But it became the subject of critical and editorial controversy in the 1990s, when Alan Helms printed the sequence from the revised ""Calamus"" versions of the twelve poems and Hershel Parker reprinted Bowers's edition from the manuscript, with both proponents defending their versions in the journal Nineteenth-Century Literature. [2]http://scholarlyediting.org/2012/editions/intro.liveoakwithmoss.html#note2""> In that exchange, Parker's argument for the manuscript version prevailed, and Bowers's editorial approach has since become the standard model for reprintings—most recently Betsy Erkkila's version of the poems alongside photo-facsimile reproductions of the manuscript leaves (see note 1). Yet Erkkila's unqualified reference to the leaves as ""clean and elegantly handwritten"" (xii) typifies an ongoing failure by editors adequately to consider the state of the ""Live Oak"" manuscript. Whereas his initial inscription of this work can indeed be described as clean and elegant, Whitman's clear and present revisions to the leaves raise significant questions about the form of the sequence and his evolving intentions for its twelve poems. As I will demonstrate in this essay, Bowers's editorial focus on the final versions of the sundered manuscripts was not well suited for ""Live Oak, with Moss,"" and it resulted in his incorporation of changes that Whitman made to the poems after breaking the sequence apart. Along with detailing the transmission of the sequence in manuscript, this essay concludes with an edition of ""Live Oak, with Moss"" that restores the sequence to its original, integrated state. The restorative edition more accurately conveys the themes and intentions that inform ""Live Oak, with Moss,"" and more clearly illustrates its significance in the development of Whitman's thought.",,"['Olsen-Smith, S.

This book is not a compendium to Lacan’s seminar. Instead it attempts to capture through shorter contributions a spectrum of voices debating, deliberating, and learning with Lacan’s concept. In doing so it can be seen to engage with transference conceptually in a manner that matches the spirit of Lacan’s seminar itself.

Unfortunately, rural schools typically receive the fewest resources while they serve large populations of economically disadvantaged children and multilingual students. Teachers in rural communities often operate in isolation, and often lack educational opportunities due to geographical isolation. This paper describes a federally funded program development, theoretical foundations and vision design to prepare K-12 Idaho teachers to work with rural multilingual learners and their families. Specifically, this paper also reports on the effort that took to translate this vision into practice. To gain a deeper understanding of the program impact, a mixed method design was used to analyze narratives, written reflections, along pre- and post- surveys collected from the twenty-eight first year participants. The total years of teaching experience ranged from less than one to 17.

FAR,47798,111699531,111699531,Thermodynamics of Indoor Air Pollution: A Pilot Study emulating Traditional Kenyan Homesteads,2019.0,Elsevier,,,,"This study examined the addition of natural ventilation (i.e., windows) in traditional Kenyan homesteads and other similar dwellings in developing countries. There is a particular need for the reduction of indoor air pollution in Kenya and other countries where traditional cooking relies on unrefined biomass fuels. For the purposes of this study, a cardboard tower equipped with thermocouples and an 80-watt heat source was constructed. As the recreation of smoke was deemed unfeasible, temperature differentials were measured within the tower and examined how varying temperature conditions might contribute to the accumulation of smoke indoors. Two scenarios were tested: windows-open and windows-closed. In the windows-open scenario, decreased temperature differentials were consistently observed throughout the sampling process with an average of 4.8 °C less than with the windows-closed (p = <0.0001). As existing research on smoke movement and temperature demonstrates, a decreased temperature differential will contribute to smoke stratification and an increased exposure to indoor air pollution. This study suggests that additional natural ventilation in isolation does not necessarily improve indoor air quality among households that use traditional cooking practices similar to Kenya’s. Rather, alternative interventions should be designed, including the placement of an exterior stove that is shielded from the elements but accessible to those indoors.",,"['Reischl, U.', 'Haggerty, L.', 'Handy, R.

Using new cross-national survey data from 14 countries, we examine the spatial variation of attitudes toward the U.S. military presence, which has been severely underexplored. Both the positive and negative externalities of hosting U.S. military forces are unevenly distributed across each host country. The country as a whole receives the general public goods of alliance ties with the U.S. and increased security from foreign threats, but areas surrounding U.S. bases receive far more economic benefits and interact more personally with U.S. military forces. However, they are also on the receiving end of negative externalities, from low-level nuisances like increased noise from military equipment to more serious issues like crimes committed by U.S. personnel against local civilians. We use this novel data to test the spatial variation of public opinion toward the U.S. military presence. This study has important implications for the role of U.S. forces in the politics of local communities in host nations and the effect these forces have on the social fabric in areas surrounding U.S. bases.",,"['Allen, M.', 'Flynn, M.

FAR,49459,112103309,112103309,Influences of a Prolific Gut Fungus (Zancudomyces culisetae) on Larval and Adult Mosquito (Aedes aegypti) - Associated Microbiota,2020.0,,,,10.1128/aem.02334-19,"Adult mosquitoes inherit a bacterial community from larvae via transstadial transmission, an understudied process that may influence host-microbe interactions. Microbes contribute to important host life history traits, and analyzing transmitted microbial communities, the interrelationship between larval and adult-associated microbiota, and factors influencing host-microbe relationships provides targets for research. During its larval stage, the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) hosts the trichomycete gut fungus Zancudomyces culisetae, and fungal colonization coincides with environmental perturbations in the digestive tract microecosystem. Natural populations are differentially exposed to fungi, thereby potentially harboring distinct microbiota and experiencing disparate host-microbe interactions. This study's objectives were to characterize larval and initial adult microbiomes, investigate variation in diversity and distribution of microbial communities across individuals, and assess whether larval fungal colonization impacted microbiomes at these developmental stages. Laboratory-based fungal infestation assays, sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, and bacterial load quantification protocols revealed that initial adult microbiomes varied in diversity and distribution. Larval fungal colonization had downstream effects on initial adult microbiomes, significantly reducing microbial community variation, shifting relative abundances of certain bacterial families, and influencing transstadial transmission outcomes of particular genera. Further, abundances of several families consistently decreased in adults relative to levels in larvae, possibly reflecting impacts of host development on specific bacterial taxa. These findings demonstrated that a prolific gut fungus impacted mosquito-associated microbiota at two developmental stages in an insect connected with global human health.IMPORTANCE Mosquitoes are widespread vectors of numerous human pathogens and harbor microbiota known to affect host phenotypic traits. However, little research has directly investigated how bacterial communities associated with larvae and adults are connected. We characterized whole-body bacterial communities in mosquito larvae preceding pupation and in newly emerged adults, and investigated whether a significant biotic factor, fungal colonization of the larval hindgut, impacted these microbiomes. Results showed that fungal colonization reduced microbial community variation across individuals and differentially impacted the outcomes of transstadial transmission for certain bacterial genera, revealing downstream effects of the fungus on initial adult microbiomes. The importance of our research is in providing a thorough comparative analysis of whole-body microbiota harbored in larvae and adults of the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and in demonstrating the important role a widespread gut fungus played in a host-associated microbiome.",,"['Frankel-Bricker, J.', 'Buerki, S.

A growing body of research has examined victim service provision using victim/client samples and complementary research has utilized service provider samples. The latter have focused on crime victim service providers’ (VSPs) perceptions regarding clients’ needs and barriers, as well as perceptions of service provision, needs, and barriers pertaining to their agency’s operations. Though relatively small, the body of provider-focused victim services research has commonly considered the influence of rurality on service provision. The present study adds to this body of research by examining reported needs and barriers of Idaho VSPs (N=94), considering the influence of rurality and concentrated need. Three research questions informed the descriptive analyses: 1) What are the most commonly identified needs and barriers for providers in the state? 2) Are there differences in identified needs and barriers between rural and urban providers, and 3) Do certain agencies report more needs and barriers than others, and if so, what are the differences? Findings indicate that many of the needs and barriers identified by Idaho VSPs mirror those identified by previous research and that agencies serving rural communities report significantly more needed services than those who do not serve rural communities. Further, approximately thirty percent of the sample was designated as ‘high need’ due to reported needs and/or barriers exceeding the average of the rest of the sample. The high need agencies were not exclusively rural in terms of agency location or population served. The potential nuances of rurality’s influence on VSPs in an overwhelmingly rural state are discussed.",,"['Gillespie, L. K.', 'King, L. L.', 'Growette Bostaph, L.

FAR,49608,114107930,114107930,Urban Energy Preferences: Policy Planning through Consultative Surveys,2019.0,,,,,"Cities are often viewed as ‘living labs’ or test beds for deploying energy and sustainability priorities (Lewis, 2017; Totty, 2017). Clean energy adoption, which links both objectives, sits at the foreground of urban planning decisions. One of the many cities that is evaluating strategies for clean energy is Boise, Idaho, which is also one of the fastest-growing metropolitan centers in the country (Sharf, 2018). To understand residents’ perspectives on energy use and utilization of energy efficiency upgrades, a survey was developed in a consultative process with the City’s Public Works staff. Respondents were asked a series of questions designed to inform Boise’s Energy Future, the energy plan that was ultimately adopted by the City of Boise in April 2019. The survey was completed by 2,129 Boise city residents in January 2019. Results indicate widespread support for clean and renewable energy goals and concern for climate change among Boise residents. Clean/renewable energy and affordability of energy were the top energy priorities of survey respondents. Solar, geothermal, wind and hydropower sources were preferred over carbon-based energy. In addition, support for Boise’s clean/renewable energy goals exists across demographic groups and zip codes, despite higher income residents and females showing stronger support than others. This paper aims to advance the practice of consultative surveys and public engagement in city planning by outlining the planning needs, conditions, key options for evaluation, and measures taken in the case of Boise’s energy planning efforts. The strengths and weaknesses of various methods are reviewed, such as consultative surveys, focus groups and open house engagement. This paper then considers potential methods of survey design that are more inclusive, for instance, factoring for low-income residents and renters due to under-representation of these groups among survey respondents. The barriers and the means to work-around such impediments are discussed. The paper turns to the more opaque results and the processes of public and stakeholder engagement to shed light on ways that informed and deliberative policy decisions may be advanced. The collaborative role of researchers in the planning process is discussed in the context of trade-offs between methodologically rigorous surveying and accurately addressing policy-makers’ informational needs. Areas for general application and future research are discussed.",,"['Larsen, B.', 'Fry, V. R.', 'Osterhout, G.', 'Araujo, K.

The (omitted for review) integrates ethics and social justice in agile 1-credit ‘Courses’ to blend social and technical essentials that promotes a more inclusive culture, prepare students to work effectively on software development teams, and be advocates for cultural and institutional change in their future careers. We have developed and offered over four semesters, six 1-credit ‘Courses’ that address a variety of professional and technical topics including foundational values in computer science, navigating computer systems, version control systems, agile development, an introduction to database systems, and technical interviewing. The foundational values course helps students develop a framework for understanding issues of ethics and social justice in computer science, and students have the multiple opportunities to utilize this framework in future technically focused hatchery units and several traditional courses that are part of the required curriculum. A core focus of this involves accounting for and approaching an understanding of the experiences of women and members of underrepresented minority groups in computer science and those affected by the use of computer science products in society. Once this is accomplished it then becomes possible to guide students in identifying sustainable processes for addressing the lack of inclusion and social justice. Preliminary results suggest that many students orient to current societal norms, and have difficulty independently identifying loss of inclusivity and social justice. However, interventions we have developed provide students with tools and skills to identify and address these biases in the classroom and in near-transfer settings. We are using multiple methods of documenting and exploring the effects of these changes, including surveys, interviews with students and faculty, and social network analysis. Next steps on the project will involve exploring and implementing ways to build and sustain inclusive community through increasing collaboration among students in different years in the curriculum. Overall, this project illustrates the benefits of developing a curriculum that is both able to quickly respond to industry needs and current issues of bias in computer science, preparing students who are better prepared for industry, ethical practitioners, and capable of becoming advocates for inclusivity.",,"['Jain, A.', 'Winiecki, D.

FAR,51275,112139145,112139145,Critical Insights: Ralph Waldo Emerson,2021.0,Salem / Grey House,,,,"Mary Oliver’s Debt to Emerson In 2000 Mary Oliver published an introduction to a volume of Emerson’s work. His impact on her writing and imagination is significant, though her poetic voice is distinctly her own. One aspect of Oliver’s debt to Emerson is evident in the Whitmanic strain in her writing. Oliver writes that Whitman’s “words,” are “a spiritual and a physical touching” (Upstream 104). Such dualism courses throughout the writing of Oliver, Whitman, and Emerson. Even though all these writers cherish the physical world for itself, they also view it as an embodiment of the spiritual. In a rare interview, Oliver expresses this Emersonian idea to Renee Olander: “The world of nature is the great warehouse of our figurative language.” In Nature, Emerson famously writes of his dramatic union with the natural world, portraying himself as a “transparent eyeball” to emphasize his transcendent connection to the universe. Oliver is less grandiose, but she takes the spiritual just as seriously as he does. In her essay “Perfect Days,” for instance, she attests to a spiritual union with the natural world, but unlike Emerson she valorizes the ordinary (Long Life 32-34). She even prefers it to the extraordinary as the token of the authentic. Nevertheless, she shares Emerson’s commitment to the epiphanies of nature. Indeed, attentiveness to the natural world is a key link between Oliver and Emerson. For Oliver, Ezra Pound’s claim rings true: “the natural object is always the adequate symbol.”",,"['Westover, J.

Abstract: This workshop involves attendees to demonstrate models, tools, and methods used to guide undergraduate computer science (CS) students to identify and propose systemic solutions for inclusion, diversity and social justice problems that occur in CS education, professions, and products. This is based on systemic theories of justice, and practices of organizational change. Students identify this as valuable and also indicate they would welcome more of the same in future CS courses. Learning Objectives: Attendees will be able to: 1. name and describe principal barriers to inclusion that exist in undergraduate STEM-oriented classrooms. 2. name and describe elements of theories of justice and processes of organizational change that can be used to address issues of inclusion, diversity, and justice in STEM-oriented classrooms and professional practice. 3. analyze and suggest systemic solutions to address issues of inclusion, diversity, and justice in STEM-oriented classrooms and professional practice. Description: Introduction: Within the context of an NSF-funded RED project (Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments) focused on replicating the best elements of a successful technology company within undergraduate higher education (our ""CSP-Hatchery""), we have embedded a set of 1-credit courses within the normal curricula. These courses include electives addressing currently emerging technical skills required by industry, and also include a focus on responding to corporate interests in improving inclusion, diversity, and justice in STEM education (particularly, computer science) and technology work and as influenced by technologies in society. This workshop focuses on theory, methods, media, and classroom management of a 1-credit course in ""Foundational Values"" required of all incoming students in the Computer Science (CS) undergraduate degree at Boise State University. The presenter is the designer and faculty lead on delivery of this course. This workshop provides a multi-perspective view on this course. First, it reviews the instructional technology underpinning its design and delivery, including learner analysis and selection of media and methods. Second, it involves the audience in a demonstration of the principal activity used in the course. Third, in the process of this interactive demonstration, it provides meta-analytic perspectives that guide instructional methods as they often play out in the course with different kinds of students. In this way, this workshop provides timely and relevant information for immediate application by attendees. Attendees at this workshop will receive a complete lesson plan and instructional materials for the activity addressed. Finally, this workshop will report student outcomes compiled from three consecutive years of delivery of this course. The Problem: Social science and a growing archive of literature and activism provides substantial resources for those aiming to address gaps in knowledge and understanding related to injustices in our society. However, those injustices persist and may even be expanding in scope and depth as we discover more about physical, administrative, technical, and personal practices reflect and enforce biases. As educators of undergraduate students, we are severely challenged to address structural changes across the whole span of events, but we are perfectly positioned to help our students develop perspectives and skills that can help them address some of these issues no matter where they find themselves. This possibility nominates each of us as part of a system of beneficial change. Because we are part of the system of higher education we can take advantage of other efforts in our schools, colleges, and universities, and add curricula that channels those other efforts to make them especially powerful for our students in their technical and future vocational pursuits. Those other efforts often come from departments in other colleges -- sociology, history, philosophy, and others -- with courses that document and analyze social problems and provide strong theory and advice on how to address those problems. There are also progressive efforts to address issues related to ""algorithmic bias,"" structural access/inaccess to technologies, and more within the fields of computer science and engineering, but they are -- so far -- not a part of the central curricular and professional focus, and they remain mostly isolated in individual elective courses without systemic influence. Additionally, however powerful they may be, curricula in other academic departments may not focus on specific phenomena they believe to be relevant in their technical pursuits, or which meet our students ""where they are"" in their lives. While some students reflect a general acceptance of these societal problems, they don't often see a path that links this to their chosen technical career, especially when their course curricula put a nearly exclusive focus on technical knowledge and skills. These are the individuals who justify inaction on the point that ""it's not my problem."" Other students tell us that these courses are explicitly not relevant to them or that they only serve to bolster the university's perceived role to ""indoctrinate them"" into a particular social agenda or political viewpoint. These individuals point to the nearly entirely technical curricula before them to justify that anything other than technical knowledge and skill is irrelevant, or stand on an already-existing and strongly held belief -- bolstered in phenomena reported in the popular press -- that a worldview of inclusion, diversity, and justice is (to them) actually a worldview that explicitly hurts them. All of these viewpoints also reflect a couplet of facts which underpin the whole of all issues related to inclusion, diversity, and justice in our society -- the majority of individuals who enter our classrooms and who populate technology workplaces are white or Asian males, and the majority of instances where inclusion, diversity, and justice are lost in our society involve individuals who are underrepresented in our classrooms and in workplaces are not members of these groups. This means the people we are attempting to guide may not have personal experiences of systemic and persistent loss of inclusion, diversity, and justice. This inexperience allows the majority to deny that such issues exist because they have not felt them. In other words, we as educators face multiple sources and sorts of resistance, possibly grounded in gaps in experiences, to efforts aiming to address these issues. This points to a need to reduce resistance to change at the same time -- or even before -- we might begin more dedicated moves toward making change. It also alludes to possible instructional methods we can use to provide some level of experience that highlights the authenticity of these problems, and which in turn can open the door to action. To review, in all of the identified sorts of resistance suggested above, two things stand out. First, each of them starts with a pre-existing attitude that our efforts are (a) beside the point, (b) irrelevant, or even (c) a danger to their success in a technical career. Second, each of them can be seen to be related to a lack of relevant personal experience with the issues. Constraints, Resources, and our Intervention: It will not be a surprise to note additional difficulties encountered with attempts to add new content and courses to an existing undergraduate degree in CS. Within our RED project we modified the existing undergraduate curricula to require a flexible set of 5, 1-credit ""Hatchery unit"" courses in every student's degree plan. One of these courses, CS-HU 130 ""Foundational Values,"" is required of every incoming student. This course is restricted to only 12.5 contact hours across 5 weeks and 10, 75 minute sessions. Since the project began in 2017 enrollment in this course had been capped at 30. After moving the course to an online format for Fall 2020 and in response to strong demand due to COVID-19, we have raised the cap to 50. Review of related literature and interviews with industry representatives indicated that all software development companies organize their personnel in teams -- there are effectively no instances where sole-developers complete a commercial project of any size. This points to the use of teamwork in the course process so we can leverage that experience as an early step toward the Hatchery goals overall. workshop reports on and engages attendees Severe restrictions on time -- a 1-credit, 5-week course (12.5 contact hours) Dale's cone of experience -- vicarious experiences through case studies Framed from the standpoint of how skills in addressing IDJ problems can improve their chances of success (teamwork, reproducible rubrics, repeated and varied practice)",,"['Winiecki, D.']",,"[{""id"": 51307, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This chapter discusses the difference among misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation and why search algorithms may lead to confirmation bias. The chapter includes analysis of the unique features of born digital texts. The accompanying lessons will focus on helping students recognize their areas of susceptibility, helping them develop an ethic of responsibility in reading and posting, and encouraging lateral reading Chapter 3: When Choosing texts and designing units Chapter 3: When teaching close reading This chapter will focus on transferring understanding about the close reading of linear texts to the close reading of digital texts, using rules of notice as a heuristic. Rules of notice are the conventional understandings experienced readers employ when they engage with texts to apportion their attention. More specifically, the lessons will introduce students to the importance of noticing direct statements of generalization, calls to attention, ruptures, and language designed to evoke a reader’s response and engage them in developing and applying rules of digital notice. Chapter 4: When teaching point of view (submitted) Chapter 5: When teaching critical theory This chapter will focus on the power of using critical lenses as a tool for understanding both literary and digital texts. More specifically, the chapter will focus on how the gender and social class lenses can enliven the discussion of literary texts and provide the grounds Chapter 6: When teaching argumentative writing This chapter will focus on helping students assess both linear and digital arguments and on developing understandings about how to mine digital sources in their argumentative writing. More specifically, lessons will focus on developing criteria for evidence that can be used as a safe starting point for arguments and on identifying the tacit and explicit reasoning that writers of digital texts use in connecting their evidence to their claims. Chapter 7: When teaching narrative writing This chapter will focus on helping students understand the way narratives are employed in digital texts and developing strategies for composing compelling personal narratives. The lessons will also examine the costs and benefits of different ways of sharing personal narratives in on-line environments. Chapter 8: When thinking about sensible sequencing and unit design This chapter will provide the mental model of EMPOWER (Envision, Map, Prime, Orient, Walkthrough, Extend/Explore, Reflect) which captures major implications for teaching from across the learning science",,"['Wilhelm, J.

FAR,51698,111669995,111669995,"“Pushing the Boundaries of the Cloister: Alternative Monastic Practices in Post- Reformation England""",2024.0,,,,,"After Henry VIII shut down Catholic religious houses following his break with Rome in 1534, few Catholic monasteries remained in England. Despite the dissolution, some Protestants, including Elizabeth I, feared that Catholics were forming monasteries illegally, just beyond the eyes of authorities. In reality, Catholics did continue many monastic practices in community with one another within England, especially within homes and prisons. With infrequent access to the typical conduits of grace—priests, sacraments, churches, and rituals—following Protestant reforms, Catholics feared for their salvation. The Catholic Church had maintained for centuries that the monastic path was the lifestyle most pleasing to God, so Catholics tried to recreate it. Without resources, rituals, and any significant Catholic institutional presence, however, these could not be monasteries in the usual sense. Motivated by religious need, Catholics borrowed from monastic traditions and combined them with whatever lay resources remained. The results were innovative communal practices that stretched the traditional boundaries between monastic and lay Catholic life. And while both men and women adopted such practices, gender norms helped determine which options were more attractive and available to members of each sex. This article explores the accommodations to monastic practice made by better-known Catholics working within England, such as Mary Ward, Luisa de Carvajal, Margaret Clitheroe, and William Weston, and modifications of lesser-known advocates, such as Elizabeth Cellier, Alexander MacKenzie, and Henry Tasburgh, to illuminate quasi-monastic communities and practices that vary in form but not in intent. Although motivated by need, these adaptations became normalized and spread beyond the boundaries of England, in the almost 300 years that Catholicism was illegal in the British Isles. Certain innovations, such as the Congregatio Jesu and the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, exist worldwide today. Catholics remained connected to their past at the same time they broke with it. And by their own new paths, they forged connections to the past and future of Catholicism.",,"['McClain, L.']",,"[{""id"": 51698, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 51698, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 51698, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2020/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 51698, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/02"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}]"

Resisting land grabbing by entrepreneurs tied to drug trafficking, agribusiness, or mining, the Peace Community refuses to support paramilitaries, army soldiers, and guerrillas. Based on ethnographic action research over a twelve year period, Christopher Courtheyn illuminates the community’s understandings of peace and territorial practices against ongoing assassinations and forced displacement. Researched during Colombia’s peace process between the government and FARC guerrillas, Community of Peace illuminates grassroots peacebuilding. Through geographical performances with the dead, the land, and fellow resistance communities, San José creates a radical and relational peace of ecological dignity. Courtheyn intervenes into debates about the meaning of peace and territory, while also interrogating the role of race in Colombia’s war and the relationship between memory and peace. Amid the widespread violence of today’s global crisis, Community of Peace illustrates San José’s rupture with the logics of coloniality and capitalism through the construction of political solidarity and communal peace.",,"['Courtheyn, C.']",,"[{""id"": 51762, ""status"": ""Revise &amp; Resubmit"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/02"", ""listingorder"": 3, ""completionorder"": 3}]"

Resource geographies are constituted by embodied spatial practices, and social movements are rich sites of knowledge creation that can follow alternative epistemologies. Instead of considering social movements as objects of investigation, we focus on our own positionality, the performance of academic learning, and the embodied and performative aspects of these struggles that may contradict and even potentiate our modalities of learning about these conflicts. To do so, we explore action research and radical performance geography as approaches for doing critical resource geographies.

A transition to sustainability has to take place within socioecological complex adaptive systems. Thus, policy-making for urban sustainability in the 21st century requires that we seriously consider the relevance of a complex adaptive systems approach. This paper offers a new roadmap for policymakers operating in the space of urban sustainability. Firstly, we attempt to clarify how complexity science can have practical relevance sustainability policies through our understanding of emergent phenomena and employ a small-N comparative analysis of case studies. Secondly, we discuss various challenges that complexity places on policy-making, focusing on the concepts of predictive capacity, causal explanation, the unconscious mind and the erosion of moral sentiments; we argue that the synthesis of these ideas provides a more nuanced and useful view for policy-making in the urban sustainability context.",,"['Fragkias, M.']",,"[{""id"": 52140, ""status"": ""Work Discontinued"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 7, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 52140, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}, {""id"": 52140, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 52140, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2019/03"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}]"

However, asymmetric inter-state conflict does occur. This incongruity suggests a double-information problem regarding the intent, resolve, and capability of both minor and major powers in dispute. This manuscript suggests that large U.S. troop deployments create a unique solution to this problem by bridging information gaps for both states that have similar and dissimilar interests thereby provoking fewer opportunities for conflict.

In biology literature cds is hypothesized to be performed on the genomic material of ciliates. Among those permutations which are sortable by cds, cds sorts them using the fewest possible block interchanges of any kind. Adamyk et al. (2013) discovered an efficient way of quantifying the non-cds-sortability of a permutation by means of an object called the strategic pile of the permutation. We partially classify the permutations with maximal strategic pile by their number of available cds moves. We complete this characterization when the number of available moves is close to maximal as well as when the number of available moves is minimal.We discover a Zn × Zn-action on permutations in Sn+1 that preserves the number of available cds moves. Using the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we obtain some enumerative results regarding the number of permutations with maximal strategic pile and a given number of moves mod (2n−1)2.We also discover new conditions for player ONE to have a winning strategy in a two-person game played on non-cds-sortable permutations, improving results from Adamyk et al.

The compositions were synthesized through a polymerized-complex approach based on the Pechini polymeric precursor route. The solubility limit of calcium ions within the PCZT lattice is in between x = 0.10 and x = 0.15, at which a CaTiO3 secondary phase is detected. The Goldschmidt tolerance factors, modified tolerance factors, and the effective vacancy sizes were all estimated for the synthesized nanopowders. While the Goldschmidt tolerance factors suggest the formation of a distorted perovskite structure, the values of the modified tolerance factor were extremely close to unity, indicating a strong stable ferroelectric perovskite structure. The optical band gap was found to decrease with calcium concentration to a minimum at x = 0.20 and then slightly increase at x = 0.25.",,"['Omran, K. H.', 'Mostafa, M.', 'Abd, E.', 'Hemeda, O.

Phenomenological and pedagogical perspectives,2021.0,WS Verlag,,,,"Heidegger asserts that Stimmungen, sustained moods or attunements, are the fundamental mode or medium of our being and being‐together. In this sense Stimmungen can be said to fundamentally atmospheric. It is a shared mood or atmosphere that determines the way that the world is disclosed to us—meaning that atmospheres possess a deeply epistemic, hermeneutic dimension. If every atmosphere brings with it a shared interpretation of the world, then one needs to share or participate in this atmosphere in order to share in knowledge or learning. Only when a Stimmung suitable to such disclosure has been cultivated or encountered will the sought‐after knowledge “dawn” on one, as Bollnow puts it (2017, p. 1414; 1956, p. 57). It goes without saying that Bollnow’s statement has significant implications for pedagogy, for teaching and learning as fundamentally atmospheric experiences, and these are explored in this paper. But I begin by discussing the elusive epistemology of the atmospheric itself—what we are able to know about how we know, what access we have to the atmospheric, to the mode of our being and knowing. Then, through an illustrative video example, I go on to discuss what can be seen to make an atmosphere, a shared way of knowing, specifically pedagogical.",,"['Friesen, N.']",,"[{""id"": 52954, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2021/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 52954, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 52954, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2019/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

Whereas many important volumes owned by Melville remain lost, copies marked and annotated in his hand continue to resurface, with sporadic impacts of new evidence on scholarship devoted to this thought and craft.

However, this association deflects attention from the apocalyptic rhetoric that comes from industry and countermovements to environmentalism. This essay seeks to remedy that oversight by proposing the concept of “industrial apocalyptic” as a significant rhetorical form in environmental controversy. Based on analysis of the rhetoric of the U.S. coal industry, we find that these industrial apocalyptic narratives rely on a burlesque frame to disrupt the categories of establishment and outsider and thus thwart environmental regulation. Ultimately, we argue that industrial apocalyptic co-opts environmentalist appeals for radical change in the service of blocking such change and naturalizes neoliberal ideology as the commonsense discourse of the center.",,"['Peeples, J.', 'Schwarze, S.', 'Bsumek, P.', 'Schneider, J.']",http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v017/17.2.peeples.html,"[{""id"": 5460, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Meanwhile, candidate dispositions for teaching have received little attention, particularly in mathematics courses for candidates. As developers and practitioners of a curriculum intervention designed to support candidates’ mathematical knowledge, we are beginning to see how much disposition towards teaching mathematics matters in a candidate's ability to attend to students' ideas. In this paper we share results from a pilot study investigating the dispositional characteristics elicited in an online video-based curriculum focused on students’ ideas on a figural pattern task.

We argue that this view needs to be expanded if we are to realize how complex human-computer rhetor systems function rhetorically in diverse contexts. Such systems do so algorithmically through procedural enthymemes, which persuade audience agents to action through the apparent logic of a given system. Procedural persuasion occurs most often via strategies that facilitate the agent to assume an active role in “self-persuasion” in order to complete a given enthymeme. In this text, we explore the procedural enthymeme as a rhetorical tactic for human and nonhuman persuasion by looking at three case studies of commonly used technological “matching” systems—search engines (Google), online matchmaking (Match.com), and social networking (Facebook)—that employ procedural enthymemes through their algorithms in order to persuade users toward particular engagements with those systems.",,"['Brock, K.', 'Shepherd, D.

Method: Forty-nine community dwelling older adult volunteers, aged 64-95 (M=77.29 ±7.60), participated in the study. Baseline and ending PASE (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly) scores were used to determine physical activity levels for the exercise (n=34) and control (n=15) groups. Results: One way ANOVA results reported no significant PASE score differences at baseline between the exercise (103.65 ±57.89) and control (113.74 ±58.30) groups. At the completion of the 12-week exercise program, no significant differences were found with the PASE scores between the exercise group (97.82 ±58.03) and control (91.20 ±51.76). Paired T-test analyses within each group demonstrated that the exercise group significantly increased PASE activities involving muscular strength and endurance (pre: 3.13 ±6.16; post:10.52 ±12.82) and decreased engagement in outdoor gardening (pre: 7.06 ±9.70; post: 2.94 ±7.19) by the end of the intervention. The control group reported a significantly lower final PASE score compared to baseline results. No significant correlations were reported between PASE scores and height, weight, BMI, modified Berg Balance Scale, timed 8-foot up-and-go, 30 second chair stand, and arm curl (p > 0.05). Conclusions: While the 12-week exercise program did not result in significantly higher levels of physical activity with the older adult exercise group, the program helped maintain a level of physical activity that was not found with participants in the control group.",,"['Shimon, J.

In this article, we build on conversations about linguistic diversity in writing studies, proposing a framework by which instructors and administrators can promote the empowerment of multilingual writers. Our framework, which we call “teaching for agency,” recognizes the resources that linguistically diverse students bring to our writing classrooms, but also takes into account these students’ needs and goals regarding English language development. We articulate a process in which students gain greater awareness and control of the opportunities for action available to them, and learn to evaluate the effects of their decisions as writers and scholars. Practitioners can help to facilitate this process, we argue, by creating optimal conditions within which students can make informed decisions. After presenting the “teaching for agency” framework, we describe how we have employed it at our own institutions, through assignments that provide an authentic and relevant rhetorical context for student writing, as well as programmatic policies that offer multiple pathways for student success. By foregrounding agency as a central construct in the teaching of writing, we hope to demonstrate our respect for what students already know and can do with language, and our commitment to expanding every student’s linguistic and rhetorical repertoire.",,"['Shapiro, S.', 'Cox, M.', 'Shuck, G.

FAR,5768,114026821,114026821,Grandparental help in Indonesia is directed preferentially towards needier descendants: A potential confounder when exploring grandparental influences on child health,2015.0,elsevier,,,,"A considerable body of evidence has now demonstrated positive correlations between grandparental presence and child health outcomes. It is typically assumed that such correlations exist because grandparental investment in their grandchildren improves child health and wellbeing. However, less is known about how grandparents allocate help to adult children and grandchildren, particularly in lower income contexts. Here we use detailed quantitative data from the longitudinal Indonesia Family Life Survey (data collected in 1993, 1997, 2000, 2007; n=16,250) to examine grandparental help in a society transitioning both demographically and economically. We test the hypothesis that grandparents direct help preferentially towards those adult children and grandchildren most in need of help. This hypothesis was supported for help provided by married grandparents and single grandmothers, who tended to: provide more help to their adult children when this generation had young children themselves, provide financial help if their adult children were poorer, and provide more household help if their adult daughters worked outside the home. One unexpected result was that help from maternal and paternal grandparents is positively correlated; if one set of grandparents is helping the other set is more likely to help, counter to our predictions. These results provide support for the hypothesis that grandparents preferentially invest in some descendants over others, where married grandparents and single grandmothers tend to invest in those adult children and grandchildren with the most need. Investigating the effect of grandparents on child health outcomes may therefore be confounded by grandparent’s preferential investment in needier descendants.",,"['Snopkowski, K.', 'Sear, R.']",,"[{""id"": 5768, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2015, ""termid"": ""2014/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,61406,114226792,114226792,Dynamic capabilities in sustainable supply chain management: An inter-temporal comparison the food and automotive industries,2021.0,,,,,"This paper seeks to enrich the theoretical debate on dynamic capabilities (DCs) in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). By extending Beske et al.’s (2014) study, a systematic literature review was conducted, and articles matching our inclusion criteria were analyzed from 2002 to 2018. Yet, two major additions are made. For the first time, two distinctive sectors, i.e., the food and automotive industry, are compared. Furthermore, a temporal perspective is provided by comparing two time periods (2002-2013 and 2014-2018) based on content as well as quantitative contingency analyses. The results for the food sector indicate a shift from “standards and certifications,” a central construct within the 2002-2013 sample, to proactive strategies aiming for the integration of stakeholders in the 2014-2018 sample. Similarly, the findings of the automotive industry indicate a shift from monitoring to joint development and knowledge management. Based on our comparison, the SSCM debate in the food industry appears more diverse in terms of practices and capabilities employed. In contrast, the analysis for the automotive industry indicates a focus on SCM elements instead of a comprehensive SSCM view. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply an intra- and inter-sectoral analysis combined with a temporal analysis within the SSCM domain. This provides evidence that the methodological approach taken allows distinguishing among both time periods and industries.",,"['Siems, E.', 'Land, A.', 'Seuring, S.']",,"[{""id"": 61406, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 61406, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2020/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

FAR,61409,114226792,114226792,The application of theory in literature reviews - illustrated with examples from supply chain management,2020.0,,,,,"Abstract Purpose - Literature review articles have become a frequently applied research approach in operations and supply chain management (SCM). The purpose of this paper aims to elaborate on four approaches for developing or employing theory in systematic literature reviews (SLRs). Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses conceptual arguments and illustrates them by pointing to recent examples. In SLRs, the material collection is usually based on keywords and searching databases, which is comparatively well documented. Data analysis, however, often falls short in documentation and, consequently, is neither well explained nor replicable. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the elaboration of the data analysis and sense-making stage in the research process of SLRs. Findings - The paper presents four different approaches, which are characterized as theory (1) building, (2) modification, (3) refinement and (4) extension, based on whether new concepts are formed or extant concepts within SCM or other fields of management theory are adopted. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this research is that literature reviews could be conducted and presented in many ways. Since the focus of this research is on systematic literature reviews, only a limited number of approaches can be discussed and presented here. Originality/value - The paper contributes to explaining the process and expected outcomes of a literature review and, therefore, aids in further developing the related methodological approaches. This is relevant as literature review publications now often replace conceptual or theoretical pieces but still have to deliver concerning demands of theory building.

This paper analyzes the use of community-based learning as an approach to integrating sustainability in supply chain management curriculum. To aid the development of such opportunities, the constructs of uncertainty and integration are presented with linkages to Bloom’s Taxonomy. Two cases of project development and implementation illustrate the potential learning outcomes and highlight challenges and risks one may expect before embarking on the journey to innovate pedagogical approaches.

In this regard, innovation in products, organizational structures, and business methods can be the key to achieving economic, social, and environmental outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how sustainable-oriented innovations (SOI) can influence inter-organizational relationships in sustainable supply chain management. The research is based on two case studies of Brazilian focal companies (Braskem and Mercur) and their respective suppliers and customers. We have identified different realities regarding operational aspects, supply chain structure, and the strategic orientation for sustainability. The cases outlined provide in-depth insights into the forms of SOI, i.e. product and organizational innovations. A practical implication includes the illustration of how the sustainability innovations allow the reaping of positive effects to businesses along the supply chain. Collaborative relationships with suppliers and buyers can be seen as a source of learning, development of new technology processes, and information acquisition. We position our research within the realm of sustainable SCM as a contribution to the increasingly discussed relationship dimensions and present links to the sustainable innovation literature, which is rarely amalgamated with the SCM discipline.

FAR,6390,112139145,112139145,The Echo of Pi'ilani's Story in W.S. Merwin's The Folding Cliffs,2014.0,,,,,"W. S. Merwin’s 1998 volume The Folding Cliffs is a book-length narrative poem about the famous nineteenth-century Kauaians Pi‘ilani and her husband Ko‘olau. The poem tells how the couple kept their family intact by preventing the exile of Ko‘olau and the couple’s son Kaleimanu to the leper colony on the remote island of Moloka‘i. Merwin characterizes Pi‘ilani as the protagonist, partly by beginning his narrative after the deaths of the husband and son and focusing on Pi‘ilani’s memory of them, then circling back to present their story more fully. Toward the end of The Folding Cliffs, moreover, Merwin describes Pi‘ilani’s dictation of her story about her son and husband’s last days to the journalist John Sheldon. While this part of Merwin’s narrative poem records Sheldon’s documentation and revision of Pi‘ilani’s story about her husband’s leprosy and death, it also echoes and differs from Merwin’s own account of Ko‘olau’s last days, a story Merwin dramatizes in the preceding pages of his poem. In this self-reflexive scene of writing, Merwin invites his readers to speculate upon the similarities and differences between his poetic account of Pi‘ilani’s story and Sheldon’s version of it. Beyond that, this narrative doubling reveals Merwin’s awareness that his writing risks violating the integrity of Pi‘ilani’s experience just as much as Sheldon’s does. While Merwin accepts the impossibility of telling Pi‘ilani’s story more accurately than Sheldon did, he also forces his readers to recognize the autonomy of Pi‘ilani and her family by repeatedly expressing her sense that her story differs from Sheldon’s expectations about it. Paradoxically, Merwin’s readers experience Pi‘ilani most vividly through her sense of difference, but that difference also guarantees that she remains “other” to the reader. By portraying Pi‘ilani’s dictation of her story to John Sheldon, Merwin makes his readers keenly aware of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s claim that “All speaking, even seemingly the most immediate, entails a distanced decipherment by another, which is, at best, an interception” (309). In focusing on the issues of “decipherment” and “interception” as she tells her story, Merwin underscores the irony and personal compromise of Pi‘ilani’s predicament. As a “native informant” (to use Spivak’s phrase), Pi‘ilani experiences the alienation entailed in the “interception” of her story by Sheldon. Since Pi‘ilani learns to read and write in The Folding Cliffs, Merwin implies that she could have written her own story instead of reporting it to Sheldon (though she would presumably have encountered difficulty in publishing it by herself). Merwin lets his readers see Sheldon’s sympathy at work as he records Pi‘ilani’s story, but he also invites them to recognize how Sheldon’s assumptions and concerns as a writer frame, and even skew, Pi‘ilani’s experience. At the same time, Merwin allows his readers to recognize his own dependency on Sheldon’s narrative for important details of Pi‘ilani’s story (a dependency he admits to when he describes his experience of reading Frances N. Frazier’s translation of Sheldon’s book in “How I Came to Write The Folding Cliffs”). In doing so, he invites his readers to honor Pi‘ilani as the source of her story, recognizing that because he offers only a version of it, they can admire its protagonist and sympathize with her without presuming to know or possess her story in a definitive (and hence totalizing) way.",,"['Westover, J.

As the author and narrator of her own story, Varl reacts to her master Peter Perry’s use of scientific discourse (including such key words as experiment and specimen) to characterize and control her (this discourse echoes Schoolteacher’s humiliating taxonomy in Toni Morrison’s Beloved). Although Varl’s literacy is an effect of her master’s experimentation, she uses this skill to imagine and frame her self-transformation from being someone else’s creature to becoming her own woman. Slave Moth emphasizes the positive cognitive impact of writing when Varl starts to record her thoughts by embroidering them into a series of petticoats she wears. In doing so, she materially and conceptually inhabits her writing. As her petticoat-diary grows, she increasingly associates it with the cocoon of the luna moth she reads about in her master’s open book. Through the ritual creation of the poem-as-cocoon, Varl exchanges her slave-mentality for a new independence of mind. She thereby reconceives the meaning of the name her master gave her (“Varl”) by contrasting it with the name her mother wanted to give her (“Free”) (Slave Moth 3 and 53).",,"['Westover, J.

After students wrestle with this context in relation to the poem, they will be ready to think about other contexts, such as the legacy of Emersonian individualism or the Romantic idea of the child’s closeness to God.

Smittium, the second genus to be described, is now also the most species-rich of the order. Species of Smittium inhabit the digestive tracts of larval aquatic insects, especially lower Diptera, worldwide. During the 75 years since the type, Smittium arvernense, was described a number of advances in our understanding of the gut fungi have unfolded, in whole or in part, with Smittium as a model for the fungal trichomycetes. This in part relates to the high number of successful isolation attempts, with about 40% of known species having been cultured, a total number that far exceeds any other genus of gut fungus. Many isolates of Smittium have been used in laboratory studies for ultrastructural, physiological, host feeding, serological, as well as isozyme, and now ongoing molecular systematic studies. Previous and current molecular studies have shown that Smittium is polyphyletic but with consistent separation of Smittium culisetae, one of the most common and widespread species, from the remainder of Smittium species. A brief overview of Smittium research is provided. Zygospore and trichospore morphology and molecular evidence (immunological, isozyme, DNA sequences and phylogenetic analyses) are used to establish Zancudomyces and to accommodate Smittium culisetae. For the latter evidence, we include the first two-gene phylogenetic analysis, using combined 18S and 28S rRNA gene sequence data to show a cluster of Zancudomyces culisetae separate from Smittium. As the broadest taxon sampling of Smittium to date, this also serves a molecular systematic update toward revisionary syntheses of this and other Harpellales taxa.",,"['Wang, Y.', 'Tretter, E.

The aim of this study was to quantify and profile the external load of practices and games during a Power-5 DI Women's Collegiate Basketball season. Specifically, Average PlayerLoad (PL), PlayerLoad per minute (PL*min −1 ), High Inertial Movement Analysis (High-IMA), and Jumps were quantified using Catapult Openfield software during four distinct training periods of the year: 8-hour preseason, 20-hour preseason, non-conference, and conference game play. Weekly variations and acute to chronic workload ratios (ACWR) were also examined. Eleven subjects participated in daily external load monitoring during practice and games via Catapult's ClearSky T6 inertial measurement units (IMU). Averages, standard deviations, and confidence intervals were calculated for training period comparisons, and Cohen's d was calculated as a measure of effect size. Findings include normative values to provide context for the demands experienced across an entire season.

FAR,6866,113150379,113150379,"Comparing local and proximal infrasound measurements at Mount Erebus, Antarctica: Implications for monitoring",2014.0,,,,10.1016/j.volgeores.2014.10.001,"Proximal (10s - 100s of meters from vent) monitoring of volcanic infrasound is a common tool at volcanoes characterized by frequent low-magnitude eruptions, but it is generally not safe or practical to have sensors so close to the vent during more intense eruptions. To investigate the potential and limitations of monitoring at local ranges (1 to 10s of km) we studied infrasound detection and propagation at Mount Erebus, Antarctica. This site has both a good proximal monitoring network and an additional International Monitoring System infrasound array, IS55, located 25 km away. We compared data recorded at IS55 with a set of 117 Strombolian events that were recorded with the proximal array in January 2006. 75% of these events were identified at IS55 by an analyst looking for a pressure transient coincident with an F-statistic detection, which identifies coherent infrasound signals. With the data from January 2006, we developed and calibrated an automated signal-detection algorithm based on threshold values of both the F-statistic and the correlation coefficient. Application of the algorithm identified Strombolian signals at IS55 over the whole of 2006 and proved reliable for indicating trends in eruption frequency. However, detectability of signals at IS55 depended strongly on the proximal signal amplitude: 90% of events with proximal amplitudes > 25Pa were identified at IS55, compared to only 26% of events with proximal amplitudes <25Pa. Event detection was also affected by considerable variation in amplitude decay rates between the proximal and local sensors. Amplitudes recorded at IS55 varied between 2% and 74% of the amplitude expected assuming hemispherical spreading, indicating that amplitudes recorded at local ranges are unreliable indicators of event magnitude. Comparing amplitude decay rates with locally collected radiosonde data indicates a close relationship between recorded amplitude and lower atmosphere sound speed structure. At times of increased sound speed gradient, higher amplitude decay rates are observed, consistent with increased upward refraction of acoustic energy along the propagation path. This study indicates that whilst monitoring activity levels at local ranges can be successful, variable amplitude decay rate means quantitative analysis of infrasound data for eruption intensity and magnitude is not advisable without consideration of local atmospheric sound speed structure.",,"['Dabrowa, A.', 'Green, D.', 'Johnson, J.', 'Phillips, J.', 'Rust, A.']",,"[{""id"": 6866, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The files suggest that interwar neighborhoods were losing long-term residents and becoming more diverse and variable. Families tried to find areas with similar standards regarding noise, space and privacy. Formerly stable neighborhoods changed, creating stress if changes were too dramatic. Even minor tensions could unsettle streets since causes of strain tended to reflect on respectability and status. While women remained the main presence due to their domestic responsibilities, men were spending more time with their families. The presence of men exacerbated misunderstandings, adding frictions over masculinity and territoriality. Complaints over noise overlapped with concerns over space which overlapped with anxiety over respectability and masculinity, all aggravated by children and gossip. When differences became too extreme, neighbors started campaigns of arguments, complaints, and harassment. Ultimately, if families were not in harmony with the rest of a street, efforts were made to force them to move. Yet neighborliness had not disappeared. Working-class neighbors generally managed to get along even in the unsettled conditions of interwar Liverpool and Manchester.",,"['Klein, J.

Fourteen participants performed four types of evaluations: between categories (cities), within categories (transport modes within a city), all categories, and a direct reading within a category from a graph. The representations were presented in random order and participants were asked to respond to sixteen questions to the best of their ability after visually scanning the related graph. There were two trials on two separate days for each participant. Eye movements were recorded using an eye tracker. Bar and line graphs show superiority over circular and radial graphs in effectiveness, efficiency, and perceived ease of use primarily due to eye saccades.

FAR,69495,112031674,112031674,Positioning faculty for funding at an emerging research institution: A case study to inform faculty academy programs.,2024.0,,,,,"Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs), which generate less than $50 million in federal research funding, constitute one-third of all U.S. institutions of higher education (National Academy Press, 2009) and are notably one of the most impactful organizations in a state system for addressing social mobility, workforce development, and economic growth of a region (Birx, et. al., 2013). ERIs are often positioned to address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion and faculty gain experience in working with first generation college students and diverse populations. Faculty at ERIs have immense opportunities to think creatively, develop scholarly projects, and establish partnerships that can generate high impact cultural, social, and economic advancements. Cultivating research at ERIs often requires that faculty expand skills sets extending beyond basic research to include broader impacts, innovation, social theory, multimedia, technology, career planning, project planning, and project management. One of the major essentials for building these skills is stepping out of the lab and practicing networked ideation, relationship building, and resource acquisition. Projects evolved through diverse networked ideation and disciplinary perspectives offer an enriched lens to maximize research quality and impacts. The skills mentioned are often a significant pivot in research and development thinking for academic faculty who are often intensely trained in lab infrastructures. Faculty often become siloed in like-minded, discipline specific networks. Faculty development infrastructure nested in a community of practice (CoP) can help transition the disciplinary and multidisciplinary silos into more robust interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research teams, advancing artistry, research, and scholarship (ARS) from a new lens, networking many minds, with diverse perspectives (Leavy, 2016). There are no doubts that creative and innovative scholarship funding pursuits are necessary for emerging research institutions but often these pursuits can be a heavy lift, presenting faculty with challenges in setting up infrastructure, reliable partnerships, finding resources, and meeting promotion and tenure deadlines. Well-designed CoP for faculty development at emerging research institutions can serve to alleviate some of the heavy lift for faculty and coordinate more productive use of time, talents, and resources. The purpose of this study was to use a case study approach (Yin, 2018) to collect data on a cohort of faculty at an emerging research institution participating in a faculty academy aimed at positioning faculty for funding. The case study aims to inform an evolving faculty academy CoP by analyzing participants’ previous experiences with funding, attitudes about funding, resource needs, and behaviors working towards positioning for funding.",,"['Duffrin, M.', 'Ransdell, L.

Qualitative data from 10 faculty at an R2 institution in the southwestern United States were collected following participation in a Pilot Project Program (PPP) supported by the [BLINDED FOR REVIEW]. The major themes that emerged from qualitative analysis centered around institutional research culture (e.g., caliber and collegiality of faculty, teaching and students); and the common challenges and supports related to securing financial resources, accessibility and information from previous awardees and senior faculty, mentoring, grant writing support, administrative support, preliminary external reviews for grants, and identifying community collaborators. Our study reinforces that research culture, an institutional factor, is as important as individual facilitators and barriers for research development. If institutions are committed to transitioning from traditionally teaching focused universities to research intensive institutions, it is important to consider both institutional and individual factors that drive success in ESI. Future studies of research productivity among ESI should further examine how individual level factors interact with institutional factors to build research capacity.",,"['Elwell, K.', 'Sanderson, K.', 'Lane, T.', 'Laurila, K.', 'Ransdell, L.

But in proceeding further―and unlike Rousseau or Locke before him―Schleiermacher carefully avoids assuming that education is primarily about a return to nature or about ""soundness"" of mind and body. Education is instead an ethical and political undertaking and a pragmatic art whose ultimate object and morality has differed greatly over time. It is exercised as a form of practical influence of the older generation on the younger: ""A significant part of the activity of the older generation extends toward the younger,"" Schleiermacher reasons, and it ""is more complete and perfect the more it is governed by an idea of what should happen―the more it has an exemplar to guide its action―the more it is an art . "" This book offers these and other insights on education―long canonical in Central and Northern Europe―for the first time to an English audience.

Defining public engagement has become increasingly complex, however, and navigating the significant and diverse literature on public engagement can be daunting. This paper addresses this challenge as well as two others that make public engagement difficult for those feeling called (or pressured) to do such work. We draw on our own public engagement experience and research to 1) conceptually scope out the terrain of public engagement literature and approaches, 2) articulate how the emerging problems of rapid intensification and hyper-polarization in American political culture make public engagement work evermore challenging for both faculty and students, and 3) call attention to the ways in which universities are often not bureaucratically or structurally aligned to meaningfully support and advance public engagement work.

Through three stories of LGBTQ+ clergy—two gay men and one lesbian—ordained in the Episcopal Church from the 1970s-2000s, this paper explores the intersections of religion and LGBTQ+ identity in Idaho at a very personal level through oral histories, interviews, and clerical records of the Episcopal Diocese of Idaho. More broadly, these sources provide insight into the struggle of one denomination’s congregations and leaders--both gay and straight, both affirming and non-affirming--to consistently question their understanding of centuries of theology to confront their own history of discrimination and forge a path toward personal and institutional acceptance and encouragement of LGBTQ+ leadership and inclusion.

Many first-year writing and GTA mentoring programs have needed to respond to challenges to these commonplaces. Such challenges may arise from a network of situations and stakeholders, including the program administrator's own observations, pressure from budgetary constraints, questions by administration, or needs of the graduate students themselves. We find ourselves in a kairotic moment that requires us to reflect on why we do what we do in the ways we do it. From this reflection, change is inevitable and possibly may be taking very different forms. Have you pushed back on some of these commonplaces? Have you found validation for/through them?

Defining public engagement has become increasingly complex, however, and navigating the significant and diverse literature on public engagement can be daunting. This paper addresses this challenge as well as two others that make public engagement difficult for those feeling called (or pressured) to do such work. We draw on our own public engagement experience and research to 1) conceptually scope out the terrain of public engagement literature and approaches, 2) articulate how the emerging problems of rapid intensification and hyper-polarization in American political culture make public engagement work evermore challenging for both faculty and students, and 3) call attention to the ways in which universities are often not bureaucratically or structurally aligned to meaningfully support and advance public engagement work.

We respond to two critiques of benefit corporations: the corrosion critique (positing that benefit corporations might discourage well-doing by traditional for-profit corporations) and the accountability critique (suggesting that benefit corporations might themselves shirk well-doing in face of profit-seeking pressures). To do so, we position benefit corporations within an ethical model centered on the requirements of other-regarding in commercial relationships. We show that the self-seeking versus other-regarding tensions that benefit corporations face reflect similar ethical tensions at play across broad areas of the law, including the fiduciary duties of traditional corporations, and that benefit corporations offer examples to resolve these tensions rather than corroding external social responsibility efforts. Then, by drawing on principles of stewardship theory, norms-enforcement from international law, and increasing calls for public “shaming” of bad corporate actors, we argue that the potential for outcasting and reputational harm from the benefit corporation’s community encourages accountability by providing strong incentives to comply with other-regarding requirements in incorporation statutes. This suggests that among the many reform proposals in the literature on benefit corporations, those that best align with existing non-legal enforcement mechanisms may provide the most efficient and feasible means for keeping benefit corporations focused on their social missions.",,"['Lingwall, J.', 'Park, S.

FAR,71320,111112978,111112978,The UN Global Plastics Treaty: Leveraging Narrative to Capture Policy,2024.0,,,,,"Plastic production and pollution have created a significant global crisis. The damage it does to humans, animals, and the natural environment is well-documented and on the rise. Local, national, and international attempts to regulate the production, use, and disposal of plastic are inchoate and weak. To take control of the situation, the United Nations formed an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC) and planned a series of five formal negotiating sessions that were intended to result in a global treaty to govern plastic at the international level. However, after four sessions, a small handful of powerful countries have mired the proceedings in a dispute about the rules of procedure that threatens to derail the entire negotiations. Making sense of the negotiations and understanding the varied positions of all parties can be a difficult task, especially because the situation is so complex, uncertain, and polarized. This Article cuts through the complexity by applying the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) to the treaty negotiations. The analysis reveals three narratives that underlie the negotiations: parties who see plastic as a villain, those who see plastic as a victim, and, finally, countries who see plastic as a hero. An understanding of these narratives, and which countries ascribe to each of them, provides a clear lens through which to view and assess the dynamics of the negotiations. This Article, one of only a few studies that apply the NPF in an international context, explores the impact of narrative on policymaking efforts and draws important connections between the INC negotiations and the global regulatory climate change regime. Our analysis demonstrates the profound influence that the construction and leveraging of narrative can have on public policy.",,"['Jebe, R.', 'Park, S.

The book delves into various facets of the international student experience, including their enrollment trends, economic contributions, and academic and research impact, with a significant focus on the hardships they face, particularly in the realm of sexual health. The authors explore the historical context of international students in the U.S., noting the evolution of their presence from the late 1800s to the present day. They highlight the resilience of these students in overcoming language barriers, cultural adjustments, financial stress, and visa regulations. The book emphasizes the economic benefits that international students bring to the U.S., contributing to tuition revenue, local economies, and job creation. A major theme of the book is the underrepresentation of international students in health research and the unique perspectives they offer. The authors argue for the inclusion of international students in research studies to enhance the quality and relevance of health research. In addressing sexual health, the book examines the diverse cultural backgrounds of international students and the impact of these backgrounds on their sexual health behaviors and attitudes. It provides detailed analyses of sexual health cultures in various countries, highlighting the cultural norms and societal expectations that shape sexual health education and behaviors. Through personal narratives, academic research, and practical recommendations, the authors advocate for culturally sensitive sexual health education and resources to support international students, aiming to foster a more inclusive and understanding environment in U.S. educational institutions.",,"['Chaliawala, K.

Mentoring is an important part of success in any leadership role, and individuals who receive mentoring typically outperform those who do not receive it. The National Association of Kinesiology in Higher Education (NAKHE) has an innovative and impactful initiative in place that focuses on mentoring for success in academic leadership: the Leadership Mentor Program. The Leadership Mentor Program is designed to build inter-institutional mentoring and networking between university Kinesiology departments and to increase aspiring administrator’s understanding of the job requirements of a Kinesiology administrator. Given the challenging environment in higher education today and the need to continue to examine exemplary models of leadership mentoring, the purpose of this paper is to: (a) outline contemporary challenges in academic leadership in general and Kinesiology specifically; (b) discuss some of the types and benefits of mentoring, with a focus on inter-institutional mentoring, (c) describe our experiences with the NAKHE Leadership Mentor Program from the perspective of the mentor and mentee; and (d) recommend possible future experiences for this program so as to guide individuals who are interested in pursuing this opportunity",,"['Goh, T.', 'Ransdell, L.

Light volleyball, which uses a larger, lighter ball than traditional volleyball, is more accessible for this population. This study investigated the effects of a 16-week light volleyball program on the functional fitness of older adults in Hong Kong. A total of 275 participants aged 60 years or older were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: a light volleyball intervention group, a Tai Chi group, and a control group. Functional fitness was assessed at the pretest, posttest, and 6-month follow-up. Results revealed that the light volleyball group exhibited more significant improvements in lower and upper limb strength, agility, dynamic balance, and aerobic endurance than did the Tai Chi and control groups. This study highlights the effectiveness of light volleyball as a newly emerging, group-based sport physical activity for promoting healthy aging in older adult women.

In fact, women remain significantly underrepresented in sport coaching. Research highlights ongoing barriers within the sport industry's patriarchal structure, and although strategies have been proposed to improve women’s representation, the lack of progress over the past two decades indicates limited effectiveness. A better approach is essential to address this issue across individual, interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels. The purpose of this study is to interview participants within the U.S. cross-country skiing program, Trail to Gold (T2G), to learn about its programming and implementation, with an eye toward learning from this comprehensive, multidimensional approach to help advance women coaches in all elite sports. Eight coaches and administrators who participated in the T2G program completed semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and reviewed by participants for accuracy. Key themes were identified using both inductive and deductive qualitative analysis methods, with final themes confirmed by triangulation. T2G participants highlighted the importance of a supportive environment, robust networking, and effective sponsorship to advance women in coaching roles. This study expands the recommended strategies to increase women’s representation in sports coaching by learning from women coaches and administrators who work in environments that value and actively pursue gender parity. Continued support for women coaches is essential for gender equality, enhanced team performance, and a more inclusive sporting environment.",,"['Angriman, A. A.', 'Ransdell, L. B.', 'Lucas, S.

Using a pre-registered survey experiment, we explore how external security threats, economic gains, and the distance of a new military installation affect attitudes toward the U.S. military. Our results show that despite a substantial increase in support for the U.S. military presence since 2020, informational prompts about security threats and basing’s possible economic benefits do not increase public support for a new U.S. military base. Alternatively, the distance of a proposed military base seems to matter more, with respondents having a higher probability of expressing more support for a more distant military installation.

Firstly, we attempt to clarify how complexity science can have practical relevance sustainability policies through our understanding of emergent phenomena and employ a small-N comparative analysis of case studies.

FAR,77164,114139989,114139989,Influence of Urbanization and Climate on Surface Water Diversions in a Semi-arid Basin,2025.0,,,,,"The western US is facing both the rapid urbanization of agricultural lands and a changing climate, producing subsequent changes to irrigation water demand and availability. Adaptive water management requires knowledge regarding how and why water usage and availability is changing; however, managers often do not possess the tools or resources for the necessary analysis. These environmental changes are also place-based, meaning that water managers cannot directly use studies from other basins to actively manage theirs. Co-produced, actionable research can help fill this knowledge gap and provide the necessary information for adaptive management. The Lower Boise River Basin (LBRB) in southwestern Idaho is one location that is facing both the pressures of urbanization and climate change and where water managers need the long-term analysis to contextualize how or if these mechanisms are affecting the irrigation system. This research studied both irrigation water diversions, and irrigation drain return flow. The goals of this research were to 1) understand how diversions and drains in the LBRB have changed from 1987 to 2020 and 2) to quantify the effects of urbanization, annual weather, and reservoir availability on diversion and drain flows. We used a Mann Kendall test to quantify changes in discharge through time and used variations of a Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Effects model to quantify the effects of predictor variables on annual discharge for both diversions and drains. Multiple linear regressions were also used for the diversions to understand the effects of predictor variables at the individual diversion scale. Diversions had variable results across the basin with a mix of increasing (18%), decreasing (35%), and no trend in discharge through time (48%). Forty percent of drains that return irrigation water back to the Boise River had decreasing trends through time while 60% had no significant change. Diversions had variable responses to urbanization, which could be the result of both human decision-making and complex changes in surface water-groundwater interactions associated with urbanization. Drain flows decreased with urbanization more uniformly, which is an indication that drain flows are supplied by discharge from the shallow aquifer system while diversions are more controlled by human decision-making. Increased evapotranspiration increased both diversion and drain discharge while increased temperatures decreased discharge for both, and precipitation played less of a role in the system. Storage water use from the reservoir system had the most consistent positive effect on diversions across models, demonstrating how the reservoir system supplies water during the irrigation season and helps offset the lack of precipitation in this semi-arid region. Increased diversion flows also increased drain flows, demonstrating that seepage loss from canals that feeds the groundwater and drain system. This analysis showed complexities across the basin for both drains and diversions and supports the need for localized research to help water managers with adaptive management.",,"['Bittman, B.

Despite the fact that scholars have noted the increase in number of EL students in non-urbanized, non-traditional ‘new destination’ settings, commensurate research has not been conducted [1]. Data show that nearly 15% of EL-identified students reside in rural settings [2] in the US. And although rural EL students constitute nearly 5% of the overall K-12 public school students, their experiences as well as those of their teachers and families remain underrepresented in the research on education [3]. This paper aims to bring voice and broaden views regarding the intersection of rurality and EL education in the US.",,"['Peralta, C.']",,"[{""id"": 77786, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This study aims to investigate the mental health of Asian American childhood sexual abuse survivors and explore the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse among Asian adults. A secondary analysis of the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data was conducted, including a final sample of 1,894 Asian adults (0.16% of the total sample size of N = 401,958). Among these participants, 16.8% ( n = 1,894) reported experiencing CSA. The most common forms of abuse were inappropriate touching (11.8%, n = 224), being forced to touch someone inappropriately (7.2%, n = 136), and being forced to have sex (4%, n = 76). Regression analysis revealed that CSA was significantly associated with lower education levels ( OR = 1.32) and higher income ( OR = 1.79), suggesting socioeconomic factors play a role in CSA reporting. Within Asian American communities, childhood sexual abuse remains a taboo topic, leading to a reluctance among adults to engage in sexual health research. This brief report highlights the dearth of research and the stigma surrounding discussions of sexual abuse among Asian American adults. There is a critical need for early intervention programs that focus on the mental health of childhood sexual abuse survivors, particularly within minority communities such as Asian Americans. Addressing this issue can support those affected and help reduce the disparities minority populations face.",,"['Chaliawala, K.

In fact, women remain significantly underrepresented in sport coaching. Research highlights ongoing barriers within the sport industry's patriarchal structure, and although strategies have been proposed to improve women’s representation, the lack of progress over the past two decades indicates limited effectiveness. A better approach is essential to address this issue across individual, interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels. The purpose of this study is to interview participants within the U.S. cross-country skiing program, Trail to Gold (T2G), to learn about its programming and implementation, with an eye toward learning from this comprehensive, multidimensional approach to help advance women coaches in all elite sports. Eight coaches and administrators who participated in the T2G program completed semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and reviewed by participants for accuracy. Key themes were identified using both inductive and deductive qualitative analysis methods, with final themes confirmed by triangulation. T2G participants highlighted the importance of a supportive environment, robust networking, and effective sponsorship to advance women in coaching roles. This study expands the recommended strategies to increase women’s representation in sports coaching by learning from women coaches and administrators who work in environments that value and actively pursue gender parity. Continued support for women coaches is essential for gender equality, enhanced team performance, and a more inclusive sporting environment.",,"['Angriman, A. A.', 'Ransdell, L. B.', 'Lucas, S.

These differences have been attributed to parent-offspring conflict, where parents prefer mates for their offspring who provide benefits to the entire family group, but adult women prefer traits in a potential partner that indicate heritable fitness (e.g., creativity, exciting personality). We compare husband’s characteristics of women in self-choice and arranged marriages using data from the longitudinal Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) which surveyed families between 1993 and 2015. Results show that the husbands of women in arranged marriages had lower levels of completed education than those from self-choice marriage, counter to predictions. There were no significant differences in the husband’s wealth prior to marriage or the proportion of couples who were of the same religion. An examination of personality traits showed little difference based on arranged marriage status. The only prediction that had significant support was that couples in arranged marriage were more likely to share an ethnic background than couples in self-choice marriages. These results suggest that the characteristics of husbands vary little by arranged versus self-choice marriage status, contrary to previous survey findings.",,"['Snopkowski, K.', 'Hasnain, A.

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of parenting behaviors on adolescent alcohol use based on sex of the adolescent. More specifically, do certain types of parenting behaviors affect male and female adolescents differently. Methods A national sample of adolescents aged 12-17 years (n = 5,723 adolescents) completed the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to assess past-year (past 12 months) and current (past 30 days) alcohol use. Results Findings indicated that 19.9% drank alcohol in the past 12 months and 8.6% drank alcohol in the past 30 days. Females were significantly more likely than males to engage in past-year [OR = 1.285 (95% CI = (1.128, 1.464)] and current alcohol use [OR = 1.432 (95% CI = (1.188, 1.725)]. Adolescents at highest risk for alcohol use had parents who never/seldom helped with homework or limited television viewing, and who fought with them greater than ten times in the past year. Conclusions Parent involvement is critical to decreasing adolescent alcohol use. Based on these findings, parenting strategies should be incorporated into efforts aimed at preventing youth alcohol use.",,"['King, K. A.', 'Chaliawala, K. S.', 'Vidourek, R.

Cultural taboos, lack of awareness, and inadequate access to menstrual health knowledge and products contribute to practices that may have adverse health outcomes and social exclusion. Government programs and non-governmental interventions have aimed to address these issues, yet significant barriers persist. This narrative review examined the socio-cultural factors influencing menstrual hygiene practices, existing interventions, and their effectiveness among adolescent girls in rural India. Key sources included peer-reviewed journal articles, government reports, and evaluation reports of interventions. Thematic analysis identified common barriers and facilitators to menstrual health and hygiene (MHH). Results Statistics suggest that 24% of adolescent girls in rural India drop out of school post-menarche due to inadequate menstrual hygiene facilities. Social stigma, restrictions on diet and mobility, and misinformation may exacerbate the issue. Government initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission and mobile education platforms like SAATHIYA have improved awareness. Yet, their impact remains limited due to persistent cultural attitudes and infrastructure gaps in rural India. Discussion Relevant studies suggest that social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) interventions, such as UNICEF’s GARIMA program, are more effective in reshaping menstrual health narratives and increasing community-level engagement, while providing comprehensive education to adolescent girls. Conclusion Addressing menstrual health requires a multifaceted approach. Community-driven strategies must be integrated with culturally sensitive education involving parents and schools, safe sanitation infrastructure, and policy reforms that span education and health, including menstruation-related knowledge for all. This approach aims to dismantle menstrual taboos. More nuanced approaches to existing and new interventions may offer a viable pathway to normalizing menstrual education and improving adolescent health outcomes in India.",,"['Chaliawala, K.

Previous studies have shown that stress, loneliness and psychological distress significantly impact both domestic and international students, but the extent and predictors of these issues may vary between groups. Methods Data were drawn from 102,905 respondents in the 2022 American College Health Association’s National College Health Assessment, including 89,663 domestic and 13,242 international students. A cross-sectional secondary analysis using logistic regression examined associations between stress and variables such as loneliness, psychological distress, and academic outcomes. Results Stress significantly predicted loneliness, psychological distress, and educational challenges in both groups. International students had slightly higher odds of experiencing loneliness (AOR = 1.508) and academic distress (AOR = 4.467) than domestic students.

Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) may play a role in shaping sexual behaviors. The current study investigates the association between ACEs, condom use frequency, demographics, and consensual sexual intercourse among undergraduate college students. Methods Upon IRB approval, a paper survey was administered among undergraduate college students enrolled in the Health Promotion and Education classes at a midwestern urban campus. A total of 152 participants were recruited through convenient sampling. Results: A univariate regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between sexual intercourse and categories of ACEs, age, condom use frequency, racial/ethnic identity, sexual orientation and sex assigned at birth. Age, condom use frequency, racial/ ethnic identity as Asian and Caucasian were significant at p logistic regression model was significant (χ² = 127.740, df = 4, p and racial/ethnic identity as Caucasian emerged as significant in the model. Discussion The findings of this study encourage universities to expand their focus beyond traditional socio-demographic and educational factors when addressing risky sexual behaviors among college students. It highlights that ACEs may be a lingering influence driving sexual activity, suggesting that trauma-informed, tailored approaches can more effectively promote safe practices and address diverse student needs.",,"['Chaliawala, K.

Project Overview By partnering with faculty at Boise State who use OER, remix OER, create OER, and use open pedagogy in their online courses, we will study 1) the relationship between OER use and student outcomes based on institutional metrics, and 2) the experience of adopting OER and open pedagogy in online settings. Research Questions How does using, remixing, creating OER and using open pedagogy impact student success in online course settings? Can we determine that with small scale studies? What is the experience of students and faculty when using OER and open pedagogy in their courses? How do they describe the efficacy of the resources used? Hypothesis Students may have higher success rates on a small scale due to immediate access to the material and reduction in textbook or materials costs. Students may feel OER and open pedagogy contributed to success in their online courses.

This groundbreaking work offers a vital, dual perspective, interweaving deeply personal lived experiences with rigorous academic research to illuminate the multifaceted journey of cultural and academic adaptation. Beyond the author’s compelling narrative in the preface, the book shares personal stories, making complex challenges tangible and relatable. From dissecting the nuances of U.S. grading systems and academic culture to exploring complex social integration, language proficiency hurdles, and the pervasive challenges of “othering” and discrimination, this book provides an honest and comprehensive account. A unique focus is placed on the distinct barriers faced by female students from conservative cultural backgrounds, offering empathetic insight into their unique struggles with participation, social norms, and mental well-being. Distinguished by its blend of personal narrative and evidence-based solutions, this book transcends mere description. It critically examines the role of institutional support, advocating for culturally sensitive mentorship, inclusive classroom practices, tailored mental health services, and essential cultural competency training for faculty and staff. ‘Cultural Influences and International Students’ is an indispensable resource for current and prospective international students seeking to understand and prepare for their journey. It is also an essential guide for higher education professionals, including faculty, advisors, administrators, and policymakers, providing actionable strategies to foster truly inclusive environments. This work stands as a powerful call to action for transforming U.S. campuses into spaces where every international student can thrive academically and personally.",,"['Chaliawala, K.
