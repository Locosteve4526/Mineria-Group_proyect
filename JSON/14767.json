        "Description/Abstract": "A primary consideration of service provision is that it meets the needs of those utilizing the services. Assessing the availability of, and satisfaction with, crime victim services is important to service development, implementation, and funding recommendations. Through a contract funded by the Idaho Council on Domestic Violence and Victim Assistance, a team of faculty and graduate students from Boise State University\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice carried out a statewide victim services needs assessment. This needs assessment included surveying victim service providers and service consumers (crime victims) regarding their experiences and needs. Crime victim services and crime victims\u2019 self-reported needs and satisfaction with current service provisions in the state of Idaho will be described. In addition, the process and experience of collaboration between academics and victim service providers will be discussed. ",
