        "Description/Abstract": "Thermal manikin tests were performed on two protective garment types to evaluate their heat transfer properties during exposure to (IR) heat radiation. Comparing a newly developed Heat Radiation (IR) attenuation vest designed for use by agricultural workers and a standard winter jacket, it could be seen that the new IR attenuation vest provided a thermal comfort benefit above a heat radiation exposure level of 150watts while the winter jacket provided a thermal benefit above a 450watt heat radiation (IR) exposure level. The study identified an important experimental temperature cross-over point which can be used to define the thermodynamic properties of a garment during exposure to IR heat radiation. This allows the characterization of temperature insulation properties of a garment. The evaluation method presents a new approach for predicting garment comfort and safety during various intensities of heat radiation (IR) exposure.",
