        "Description/Abstract": "Despite the prevalence and severity of sexual violence, case attrition has &lt;br&gt;been identified as a significant issue. Of the cases that are reported to police, &lt;br&gt;only a small portion result in arrest, prosecution, or conviction. Research &lt;br&gt;has revealed that much of this attrition occurs early in the process and &lt;br&gt;that a number of theoretically supported legal (e.g., physical evidence, victim &lt;br&gt;participation) and extralegal (e.g., demographics, victim credibility) factors &lt;br&gt;influence how and whether a case progresses through the criminal justice &lt;br&gt;system. However, few researchers have directly examined the impact of &lt;br&gt;officer doubt on case processing. Whereas legal and extralegal factors &lt;br&gt;represent case characteristics, doubt represents officer cognition about &lt;br&gt;these characteristics. These perceptions can affect how victims are treated, &lt;br&gt;how police investigate the case, and ultimately, the case\u2019s progression &lt;br&gt;through the system. A random sample of sexual assault reports from one &lt;br&gt;police department in a medium-sized jurisdiction in the western U.S. was &lt;br&gt;drawn to examine the expression of officer doubt, as well as its impact on\u00a0victim participation, arrest, and referral for prosecution while controlling &lt;br&gt;for relevant legal and extralegal factors. The findings suggest that officer &lt;br&gt;doubt is an important consideration in sexual assault case processing, &lt;br&gt;independent of other legal and extralegal factors, and that it significantly &lt;br&gt;impacts the likelihood of arrest and referral for prosecution. Consistent &lt;br&gt;with previous research, police decision-making was also impacted by certain &lt;br&gt;legal factors. Victim participation was not directly affected by officer doubt &lt;br&gt;but it was predicted by extralegal factors. Implications for future sexual &lt;br&gt;assault research and practitioner training are discussed.",
