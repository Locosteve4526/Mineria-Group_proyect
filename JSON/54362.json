An updated version of this 2020 presentation was newly accepted for the Spring 2021 CCCC -- blind peer-reviewed.] This session invites participants to develop ideas for an institutional investment in storytelling and reflection across the curriculum/campus. The facilitators begin by providing two examples of campus-wide narrative-in-action initiatives. Participants work in problem-solving groups to identify narrative needs on their campuses and design cross-disciplinary resources to fit those needs.   \n",
