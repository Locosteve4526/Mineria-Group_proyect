        "Description/Abstract": "Gottfredson and Hirschi's General Theory of Crime has been widely tested. Yet, one of their key hypotheses\u2014the stability of self-control hypothesis\u2014has received little attention from researchers, and no known study has examined the applicability of the stability hypothesis in a non-western context. Given Gottfredson and Hirschi's claim that their low self-control theory transcends cultural and national boundaries, we tested the hypothesis with a nationally representative sample of South Korean adolescents using five year panel data. Consistent with studies conducted in the U.S., our results offer partial support for Gottfredson and Hirschi's stability hypothesis. We also provide comparative interpretations of our findings in the South Korean context.",
