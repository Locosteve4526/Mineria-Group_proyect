        "Description/Abstract": "Together We Rise: Reclaiming the Female Gaze is an online exhibition for women artists centered around female empowerment. Though women have historically been underrepresented in the art world, female artists have continued to push back and elevate their voices through art. The essential question guiding this exhibit is: how can we use art to visually communicate our thoughts, beliefs, and experiences in response to the world around us? In this exhibit, you will find a wide range of work that responds to this question.",
