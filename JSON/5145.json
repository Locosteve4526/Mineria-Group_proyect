        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this project was to compare an integrated health and  physical education curriculum, focused on reducing media use and on  increasing physical activity in middle school adolescents, to  traditional and nonintegrated health and physical education curricula.  Two middle schools' health and physical education classes were assigned  to an intervention or traditional curriculum group. No differences were  found in the average change in media use between the intervention and  the traditional groups (-8.5 hrs/wk vs. -5.5 hrs/wk, p = 0.112), while  there was a greater increase in average step counts in the intervention  group than in the traditional group (+1732 steps/day vs. -571 steps/day,  p = 0.03). The results of the study suggest that a media literacy  approach to health education combined with a student-centered approach  to physical education may increase physical activity in middle school  adolescents.",
