        "Description/Abstract": "Performance on standardized writing assessments indicates that less than one-third of American K-12 students are proficient in writing. Despite this statistic, the current emphasis on reading in elementary schools means preservice elementary teachers may observe little writing instruction during field experiences. This article presents the results of a semester-long collaborative writing exchange designed in response to these problems. Qualitative methods were used to determine how 22 elementary students' writing improved as a result of helping a cohort of five student teachers learn to use the 6+1 Trait\u00ae Writing Model for Improving Student Writing. The findings have implications for classroom teachers, teacher educators, and teacher preparation programs.",
