        "Description/Abstract": "Invasive Oriental Weatherfish (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus)  populations have become established in many countries worldwide. To  understand the invasive potential of this non-indigenous species,  information about its demography and life history within these novel  habitats is needed. Here we present data supporting the use of pectoral  fin morphology for determining sex within a population of weatherfish in  and around Boise, Idaho, USA. Enlargement of the second pectoral-fin  ray and presence of a lamina circularis was seen in males both mature  and immature. No such morphology was seen in females. Examination of  gonadal tissue confirmed external sex determination in 99% of mature  females, 97% of mature males, and 70% of juveniles less than 10 cm total  length. This study is the first to verify use of sexually dimorphic fin  characteristics as a field diagnostic in an invasive population of  Oriental Weatherfish.",
