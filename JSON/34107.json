        "Description/Abstract": "The equipment lock has been an important tool for the power company to protect the electricity metering equipment. However, the conventional equipment lock has two potential problems: vandalism and counterfeiting. To fulfill the control and track the potential illegal behavior, the human labor and paper are required to proceed with related operations, resulting in the consumption of a large amount of human resources and maintenance costs.\r\nThis study focused on the design of RFID technology applied to the traditional equipment lock, which, through the mobile and electronic technology, strengthens the management/operating convenience of the lock and provides the solutions for anti-counterfeiting and spoilage detection so that the national energy can be properly protected and fairly distributed.
