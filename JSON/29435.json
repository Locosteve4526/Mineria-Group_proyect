        "Description/Abstract": "When teachers write, good things can happen; writing helps educators to better understand themselves, as well as students, parents, and colleagues. This practical book illustrates how to encourage, lead, and sustain teacher-writers, especially in group contexts. In contrast to guides on writing and teacher research, this book is designed for those who support teacher-writers, such as teacher educators and literacy coaches. The authors offer descriptions of key practices they have developed over years of coaching, teaching, and collaborating with K\u201312 teachers who write about classroom instruction, teacher research, or advocacy for better policy and pedagogy. Knowing firsthand just how hard writing can be for teachers, they provide a repertoire of strategies to elicit writing, to support teachers as they write, to find audiences for teachers\u2019 work, and much more.\r\n\r\nThis book offers clear guidance to coach teacher-writers to:\r\n\r\nChoose topics and shape ideas.\r\nConquer insecurities and draw from their strengths.\r\nEstablish authority with their audience.\r\nNavigate publishing, including choosing venues and working with editors.\r\nFind time and space to write and create the habits of writing daily.\r\nRespond to audience reaction to their writing.\r\nReflect on their teaching and writing.\r\nDevelop a voice and vision as a professional.",
