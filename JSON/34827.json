        "Description/Abstract": "In this paper the authors argue for increased responsiveness on the part of contaminants researchers with regard to public knowledge and willingness to change behaviors relative to contaminant exposure. The authors observe calls for integration of physical and human or social dynamics research and offer one such integrated approach and the need to make more accessible the complexities of water contamination by focusing on three categories of contaminants most relevant to human health (phosphorus and algae blooms, heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyl). Emphasis is placed on both the physical attributes (toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation) and the human health considerations (source, vector, route of exposure, and hazard level). The authors extend this review and integration by arguing for common public information signage. Specifically the authors incorporate aspects of other publicly-recognizable systems into a standard signage system. ",
