        "Description/Abstract": "Nuclear graphite is commonly used as a moderating material as well as a key structural component in current nuclear reactors. In addition, nuclear graphite is also a candidate material for the future Generation IV reactors such as the very high temperature nuclear reactor (VHTR), which may operate at up to 1000\u00b0C. During irradiation, significant structural changes to graphite\u2019s crystal lattice occur leading to plastic deformation. The current understanding is that when carbon atoms are displaced from lattice positions via irradiation, interstitial and vacancy defects form and coalesce between basal planes, leading to the observed c-axis expansion and a-axis contraction. These structural changes play an important role in the changes of the mechanical properties and therefore the performance of nuclear graphites; however, a clear consensus on the various atomic mechanisms responsible for structural and property changes in nuclear grade graphites has not yet emerged due to the difficulty in monitoring the dynamic atomic response of graphite during irradiation. \n\nIn-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers a way to monitor the atomic response of the graphite lattice during irradiation in which electrons are used as a substitute for neutrons. In this work, in-situ electron irradiation studies on IG-110 nuclear graphite have been conducted at 800\u00b0C with a dose rate of approximately 10-3 dpa/s. Experimental observations show fullerene-like defects in disordered areas of the microstructure as well as their formation interstitially between basal planes. The formation of interstitial defects results in significant c-axis expansion. The formation of these nanostructures is proposed as one of the many mechanisms resulting in the dimensional changes seen in irradiated nuclear graphites at high temperatures.",
