        "Description/Abstract": "A constructivist interpretation of the learning process has been  supported by research on students conceptions in physics in the last  twenty years. The paper outlines the elements of a constructivist view  of learning referring to knowledge as a personal construction, which is  bound by viability criteria, not by the non operational notion of an  objective reality. Conceptual change is, or should be, the objective of  instruction. Computer technology can be used in education to establish a  constructive environment, which would help students by providing a new  understanding of the world.",
