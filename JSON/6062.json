        "Description/Abstract": "The target articles make significant advances in our understanding of students\u2019 judgments of their cognitive processes and products.  In general, the advances are relative to a subset of common themes, which we call the four cornerstones of research on metacognitive judgments.  We discuss how the target articles build on these cornerstones (judgment bases, judgment accuracy, judgment reliability, and control) and how they are relevant to improving student achievement.",
