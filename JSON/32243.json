        "Description/Abstract": "The unexpected discoveries of hundreds of exoplanets very close to their host stars have challenged planet formation theories. Recent searches have even found small rocky planets with orbits reaching almost down to their host stars' surfaces, including an iron-rich Mars-sized body with an orbital period of only four hours. So close to their host stars that some of them are actively disintegrating, these objects\u2019 origins remain unclear, and standard formation models have trouble accounting for them. In this presentation, I will discuss the approach taken by our group, SuPerPiG, in analyzing the photometric time-series from NASA\u2019s Kepler and K2 missions to tease out the shadows of these unique and challenging planets.",
