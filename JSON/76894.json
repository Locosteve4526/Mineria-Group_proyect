        "Description/Abstract": "Among many economic pocketbook issues identified as being potentially influention on vote choice in the U.S., gas prices have risen to a prominent place. Commentators regularly include them in a basket of consumer goods that the public pays close attention to, especially elevated prices. As a simple reward and punishment mechanism, gas prices may well play a critical role in incumbent party approval. I explore this research question using unique datasets of multi-year daily gas prices in the U.S. and Canada, as well as daily and monthly governmental approval ratings in both countries. I will analyze the data using crosstabulations and Pearson correlation coefficients, testing the reward and punishment hypothesis in presidential and parliamentary contexts.",
