        "Description/Abstract": "Matchmaking is a tradition as old as marriage itself, and the activities and practices surrounding it have shifted alongside marriage. Building Relationships: Online Dating and the New Logics of Internet Culture uses an apparatus approach to media analysis in order to examine online dating in relation to contemporary marriage and American culture. Shepherd analyzes the logics of compatibility, online dating site procedures, and user narratives of popular matchmaking sites in order to determine whether the synchronic logic of online dating is compatible with the historically diachronic logic of marriage.",
