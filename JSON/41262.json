        "Description/Abstract": "Complex perovskites of the form AB0.5B\u20190.5X3, where A, B, and B\u2019 are cations and X is\nan anion, abound in technological applications. In many cases B and B\u2019 cations\nchemically order on crystallographically unique sites, influencing properties and\nresulting in a volume shrinkage. In this work, various compounds including\n(Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Mg0.5W0.5)O3 and (Sr0.5Ca0.5)(Mg0.5W0.5)O3 as well as several compositions in the [(Ca, Sr, Ba)1-3xLa2x](Mg0.5W0.5)O3 series were made via conventional techniques. In particular, the [(Ca, Sr, Ba)1-3xLa2x](Mg0.5W0.5)O3 system allows the effect of B-site ordering on effective ionic sizes and cell volume to be studied as a function of A-site size as the host crystal changes from cubic (A=Ba) to tetragonal\n(A=Sr) to monoclinic (A=Ca). Data mining was also employed to include the host of\nother reported ordered perovskites in a model for the prediction of the effective\nchange in B-site size, \u0394rB, upon ordering. Such a model would allow the prediction of\nstructures with little or no experimental data, thus eliminating much of the trial and\nerror and drastically reducing material-development time and costs. The goal of this\nproject is to establish a generic numerical model for the effective ionic radii and\nlattice constants for complex perovskites containing B-site ordering.",
