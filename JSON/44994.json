        "Description/Abstract": "A new N2S ligand bis(pyridyl)(2-mercapto-1-methylimidazolyl)methane (2, Py2MeImS) has been synthesized\nand characterized. Treatment of this ligand with bromide and triflate salts of Zn(II) results in the\ncomplexes (Py2MeImS)ZnBr2 (3) and [(Py2MeImS)2Zn](OTf)2 (4), respectively. The solid-state structure\nof (Py2MeImS)ZnBr2 shows bidentate N,N-coordination of Py2MeImS to the zinc ion, with the sulfur atom\nof the 2-mercaptoimidazole moiety uncoordinated. Two conformers of 3 rapidly interconvert in solution\nat room temperature, and variable temperature NMR studies and DFT calculations were used to help\nassign the likely identity of these conformers. In contrast, the crystal structure of [(Py2MeImS)2Zn]\n(OTf)2 exhibits a zinc ion with a distorted octahedral geometry where the two sulfur atoms of the two\nligands are coordinated to the zinc center in a cis-configuration. Even though the cis-isomer (4-cis) is calculated\nto be lower in energy than the trans-isomer (4-trans), the low temperature 1H NMR spectrum of 4\nreveals a single symmetric species that is inconsistent with the cis-isomer observed in the solid-state\nstructure. DFT calculations propose alternative higher energy structures, including a trans-configuration\nof the coordinated S-atoms of the two Py2MeImS ligands, as well as structures in which the 2-mercaptoimidazole\ngroups are no longer coordinated to the zinc(II) center. These studies provide",
