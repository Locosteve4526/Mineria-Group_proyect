        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Illegal killing of protected nongame wildlife is pervasive and demographically relevant. To address the issue, law enforcement and resource managers need to understand when, where, and why illegal killing occurs. Spatial and temporal patterns in illegal killing can provide insight into potential drivers behind the activity and key information to manage this threat. We used two years of field survey data collected along power lines in a conservation area in Idaho, USA, to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of illegal shooting of protected nongame birds. We then examined patterns in the distribution of illegal shooting to draw inferences about potential drivers behind the activity. Illegal shooting was clumped both temporally and spatially as opposed to being randomly distributed across the year and landscape. For example, most illegal shootings occurred during spring months, coincident with peak time periods of legal recreational shooting activity, and ceased during months with low recreational shooting activity. Furthermore, the locations where we found some carcasses of illegally shot birds were in places with high levels of recreational shooting activity. Additionally, a successful investigation and prosecution of illegal shooters indicate some of the illegal shooting we detected was a targeted criminal act in which protected wildlife were sought out, as opposed to being opportunistically encountered during the course of other activities. The insight our work provides can enable owners of power lines, law enforcement agencies, and resource managers to develop appropriate solutions to manage a threat that may have widespread impacts for some species.&lt;/p&gt;",
