        "Description/Abstract": "After considering a proposal to require the engagement partner\u2019s signature on the audit report (PCAOB\n2009), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board chose instead to only require the disclosure of the\nengagement partner\u2019s name (PCAOB 2015). We make predictions regarding the effects of the two proposed\nrequirements using insights from social norm theory, and test those predictions using an experimental audit market\nsetting found in the literature. We find that both requirements reduce misreporting when compared to a control setting\nwith neither requirement present. We also document that the signature requirement generates an incremental\nreduction in misreporting when added to the disclosure requirement. Finally, we provide evidence that these effects\nare driven by participants with higher sensitivity to social norms. This theory and evidence supports the new identity\ndisclosure requirement at the PCAOB and helps explain the existence of signature requirements in many non-U.S.\ncountries.",
