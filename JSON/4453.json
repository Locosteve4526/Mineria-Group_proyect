        "Description/Abstract": "Mountain front catchment net groundwater recharge (NR) represents the  upper end of mountain block recharge (MBR) groundwater flow paths. Using  environmental chloride in precipitation, streamflow and groundwater, we  apply chloride mass balance (CMB) to estimate NR at multiple catchment  scales within the 27 km2 Dry Creek Experimental Watershed  (DCEW) on the Boise Front, southwestern Idaho. The estimate for average  annual precipitation partitioning to NR is approximately 14% for DCEW.  In contrast, as much as 44% of annual precipitation routes to NR in  ephemeral headwater catchments. NR in headwater catchments is likely  routed to downgradient springs, baseflow, and MBR, while downgradient  streamflow losses contribute further to MBR. A key assumption in the CMB  approach is that the change in stored chloride during the study period  is zero. We found that this assumption is violated in some individual  years, but that a 5-year integration period is sufficient.",
