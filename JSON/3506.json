        "Description/Abstract": "There has been limited research examining the pedagogical benefits of peer feedback for facilitating project-based learning in an online environment. Using a mixed method approach, this paper examines graduate students\u2019 participation and perceptions of peer feedback activity that supports project-based learning in an online course of Instructional Design. Our findings indicate that peer feedback can be implemented in an online learning environment to effectively support project-based learning. Students actively participated in the peer feedback activity and responded positively about how the peer feedback activity facilitated their project-based learning experiences. The results of content analysis exploring the peer feedback provided reveal that learners were mostly supportive of peers\u2019 work and they frequently asked questions to help advance their peers\u2019 thinking. The implications and challenges of implementing peer feedback activity in an online learning environment are discussed.",
