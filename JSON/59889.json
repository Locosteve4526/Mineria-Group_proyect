        "Description/Abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) maintain the musculoskeletal system by differentiating into multiple lineages, including osteoblasts and adipocytes. Mechanical signals, including strain and low-intensity vibration (LIV), are important regulators of MSC differentiation via control exerted through the cell structure. Lamin A/C is a protein vital to the nuclear architecture that supports chromatin organization and differentiation and contributes to the mechanical integrity of the nucleus. We investigated whether lamin A/C and mechanoresponsiveness are functionally coupled during adipogenesis in MSCs. siRNA depletion of lamin A/C increased the nuclear area, height, and volume and decreased the circularity and stiffness. Lamin A/C depletion significantly decreased markers of adipogenesis (adiponectin, cellular lipid content) as did LIV treatment despite depletion of lamin A/C. Phosphorylation of focal adhesions in response to mechanical challenge was also preserved during loss of lamin A/C. RNA-seq showed no major adipogenic transcriptome changes resulting from LIV treatment, suggesting that LIV regulation of adipogenesis may not occur at the transcriptional level. We observed that during both lamin A/C depletion and LIV, interferon signaling was downregulated, suggesting potentially shared regulatory mechanism elements that could regulate protein translation. We conclude that the mechanoregulation of adipogenesis and the mechanical activation of focal adhesions function independently from those of lamin A/C.",
