        "Description/Abstract": "The Water Droplet Penetration Test (WDPT) is commonly used in most soil water repellency&lt;br&gt;(SWR) research and is particularly prominent in field studies after wildfire events. Suppose a water&lt;br&gt;droplet does not infiltrate the soil within the first five seconds. This soil is considered to contain&lt;br&gt;some degree of water repellency, classified by the overall penetration time. Our results show an&lt;br&gt;inflection point in the plot of the height of a droplet vs. droplet penetration time during a WDPT&lt;br&gt;trial. This inflection point is indicative of a combination of two possible flow patterns influencing&lt;br&gt;droplet penetration, one governing and the other\u2014caused by particle lift\u2014drastically impeding the&lt;br&gt;infiltration rate. The reorganization of the intrinsic particle lift at the air\u2013water interface leads to&lt;br&gt;contact angles hindering the expected penetration, delaying the expected infiltration rate to degrees&lt;br&gt;larger than a continuously flat porous hydrophobic surface would. The particle lift creates an&lt;br&gt;instability that can create two competing regimes, leading to two sets of water droplet penetration&lt;br&gt;times. The similarity among sorptivity values for coarse grains at higher hydrophobicity levels,&lt;br&gt;medium grains at intermediate hydrophobicity levels, and fine grains at lower hydrophobicity levels&lt;br&gt;suggests that interpretation of the WDPT needs to be adjusted based on grain size.",
