        "Description/Abstract": "Mothers of late preterm infants need ongoing support because they often find establishing breastfeeding (BF) to be complex and difficult. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children peer counselors provide BF information and emotional support to new mothers in many communities. However, their current training does not include education about BF for the late preterm infant. The purpose of this report is to present important information about BF and the late preterm infant that can enhance peer counselors' ability to offer appropriate support. The effect of this education on outcomes such as BF rates, maternal self-efficacy, infant hospital readmissions, and peer counselors' self-efficacy needs to be investigated.",
