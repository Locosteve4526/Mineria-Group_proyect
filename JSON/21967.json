        "Description/Abstract": "Senator Frank Church of Idaho was an early and persistent opponent of the escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam under President Lyndon Johnson. A member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Church was one of a handful of members of Congress who began publicly criticizing Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy in the mid-1960s. When Church\u2019s fellow committee members resisted his calls for public hearings on Johnson\u2019s policy in 1965, the senator worked to reach the public via the news media. This article explores how the news media -- in particular, the New York Times -- responded to Church's outreach efforts. ",
