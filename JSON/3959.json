        "Description/Abstract": "Ungulate and carnivore diversity patterns since 30 Ma in different  regions of the western United States suggest abrupt increased                      diversification at 17\u201317.5 Ma, followed by  decreases ca. 11 Ma, and stasis thereafter. Although global climate  change presumably                      affects evolution, we hypothesize that widespread  extensional tectonism in the western U.S. also helped drive diversity  increases                      ca. 17.5 Ma through a topographically induced  increase in floral and habitat diversity. The decreases in diversities  ca. 11                      Ma, as well as the rapid increase in C4 ecosystems  (RICE) worldwide at 7\u20138 Ma may have responded to climate teleconnections                      and increased seasonality linked to global cooling  and growth of orogenic plateaus, particularly the Tibetan Plateau  between                      13 and 8 Ma. Thus, biodiversity complexly responds  both to climate and to tectonics.",
