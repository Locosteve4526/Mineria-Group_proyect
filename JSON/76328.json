        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Our class met with administrators and a resident from the East Boise Community Reentry Center (EBCRC), who identified a need for information regarding community support strategies for women who have recently been released from incarceration. Our team conducted a review of prior literature to determine specific risk factors for relapse and recidivism among formerly incarcerated females, as well as best evidence-based practices for helping these women be successful in their post-release lives. The research approach involved gathering articles from university databases and government websites, focusing on reentry programs, predictors for rearrest, and effective interventions for justice-involved individuals, both pre- and post-release. We synthesized the findings in the literature into four distinct themes that may be considered in the effort to reduce rates of recidivism: a) Personalized assistance (e.g., individual counseling and targeted forms of therapy); b) Reducing stigma (e.g., advocacy and addressing internalized shame associated with incarceration); c) Preparation, programs, and education (e.g., awareness of resources, coping strategies, and vocational training); and d) Community support (e.g., group therapy, professional supervision, and family/friend involvement). These findings present important implications for effective aftercare concerning formerly incarcerated women. We emphasize the importance of tailoring care about the context of an individual\u2019s original criminal offense, considering the influences of personal identity, systemic barriers, history of trauma, history of substance use/abuse, and quality of community support.&lt;/p&gt;",
