        "Description/Abstract": "In this work, we build and test three memristor-based true random number generator (TRNG) circuits: two previously presented in the literature and one which is our own design. The func-tionality of each circuit is assessed using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Statistical Test Suite (STS). The TRNG circuits were built using commercially available off-the-shelf parts, including the memristor. The results of this work confirm the usefulness of memristors for successful implementation of TRNG circuits, as well as the ease with which a TRNG can be built using simple circuit designs and off-the-shelf breadboard circuit components.",
