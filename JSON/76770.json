        "Description/Abstract": "Here it is shown that the exciton interactions within organic dye aggregates, as modeled by the Frenkel Hamiltonian, enable the construction of an on-off switchable exciton gate. In this construction, a single exciton residing on a controlling gate molecule may pass or inhibit the ballistic propagation of an exciton in a proximal gate channel consisting of an array of dye molecules. High on-off ratios in excess of 102 can be achieved through the use of static difference dipole-dipole interactions between the gate and the gate channel which effectively creates a switchable Bragg grating. The gate channel and controlling gate molecule exhibit entanglement with the quantum-mechanical superposition of the presence and absence of exciton occupation on the gate molecule.",
