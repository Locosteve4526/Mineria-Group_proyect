        "Description/Abstract": "Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s Perspectives on Marriage\nJeff Westover\nIn a number of texts, both published and unpublished, Elizabeth Bishop addresses the themes of marriage, love, and courtship. In an era when it was dangerous to be an out-of-the-closet lesbian, the issues of love and marriage were vexed ones for her. As a young woman, she rejected Robert Seaver\u2019s marriage proposal (Millier 112). Later, her friend Pauline Hemingway wondered in a letter to Bishop whether she and Tom Wanning were engaged (Millier 102), and Robert Lowell famously confessed to her that she was \u201cthe one that got away\u201d (WIA 225-26). As a woman whose most important romantic relationships were lesbian at a time when same-sex relationships (much less marriages) were not socially sanctioned, Bishop had to confront the issue of marriage and adopt a quasi-public stance toward it in order to pursue a career as a professional writer. Her letters demonstrate that she felt the social pressure of other people\u2019s expectations that she should marry. In a letter of March 11, 1941, for instance, Bishop wryly points out to Frani Blough that her housekeeper, Mrs. Almyda, wants her to have a baby (OA 99). I propose to address Bishop\u2019s treatment of this topic in several contexts, including two unpublished and virtually undiscussed stories from the archives, \u201cEula Wiggle\u201d (VC 53.19) and \u201cRiver-Rat\u201d (VC 53.4), in order to account for a pattern of indirection she displays regarding the institution (or \u201centerprise,\u201d to borrow terms used by Bishop\u2019s mentor, Marianne Moore, in her own important long poem about marriage). In particular, these two stories reveal that marriage was not only on Bishop\u2019s mind as \u201cmaterial\u201d for fiction and poetry, but as a matter to reckon with in personal terms.\nIn keeping with her reputation for reticence, when Bishop addresses the matter of courtship and marriage in her writing, she often does so indirectly. In several texts, for instance, courting characters or married spouses are observed and commented on by a narrator, so that Bishop can treat the topic through a distanced perspective. This is the case in the poem \u201cHouse Guest,\u201d as well as the two unpublished stories. In the first two \u201cSongs for a Colored Singer,\u201d moreover, Bishop invents a persona who expresses her dissatisfaction with marriage, which has gotten so bad that she is \u201cgoing to go and take the bus / and find someone monogamous\u201d (Poems 37). In \u201cRoosters,\u201d Bishop tartly comments on the subordination and even disposability of wives. In addition, a youthful Bishop published the story of a courtship that goes singularly awry, \u201cThe\nThumb.\u201d The character-narrator of this story is a male suitor who is both attracted to and repelled by the woman he pursues. In a posthumously published story, \u201cWas It in His Hand?,\u201d two female friends (the narrator being one of them) consult a psychic who assumes that they want to know what their future husbands will be like. Although the subject of marriage is not at the center of other major poems, Bishop wrote many love poems, including not only exuberant ones, but also ones about unhappy, lost, or unrequited love (\u201cInsomnia,\u201d \u201cFour Poems,\u201d \u201cArgument,\u201d \u201cLetter to N.Y.,\u201d \u201cVarick Street,\u201d \u201cSong for the Rainy Season,\u201d \u201cOne Art,\u201d \u201cIt is marvelous to wake up together,\u201d \u201cDear, my compass,\u201d \u201cClose, close all night,\u201d \u201cVague Poem,\u201d and \u201cBreakfast Song\u201d). In the important long poem \u201cCrusoe in England,\u201d moreover, the speaker\u2019s solitude is a central feature, and his grief about the death of Friday powerfully resonates at the end of it. Incomplete families also appear in the Manuelzinho poems (\u201cManuelzinho,\u201d \u201cSquatter\u2019s Children,\u201d \u201cGypsophilia\u201d). As she indicates in an unpublished letter to Ruth Foster, she also watched at least one woman whom she cared for, Judy Flynne, lose her intellectual liveliness after many years of marriage (VC 188.33). Finally, in \u201cMr. and Mrs. Carlyle,\u201d dated 1978, she wittily figures marriage as a tender monstrosity: \u201cOne flesh and two heads / engaged in kisses or in pecks, / Oh white seething marriage! / O Swan with Two Necks!\u201d (Poems 264). The unpublished stories can enrich and deepen our sense of Bishop\u2019s attitude toward marriage in relation to her own long-term \u201cmarriages\u201d with women, her ambitions as a professional writer, and her fraught relationship to home and travel.\nBishop, Elizabeth.
