        "Description/Abstract": "Lab sections are routinely used in biology courses and are often viewed as intrinsic settings for active learning. However, many labs have introductory material that is introduced using a traditional lecture format. Therefore, opportunities exist for increasing active learning in labs. We implemented a controlled experiment in which labs in an introductory biology course were modified to increase active engagement from students. In modified labs, quizzes were replaced by pre-class assignments, learning objectives were articulated, lecturing was interspersed with lab proceedures and supplemented with active learning, and labs concluded with a class-wide concept map and minute paper. We assessed the effects of these modifications in three ways; students were surveyed, classroom observations were conducted, and student scores on tests were examined. We found that students were open to and enjoyed the use of active learning, that lab modifications significantly shifted patterns of classroom behavior but that modifications had no effect on exam scores. This suggests that before the modifications, active learning was not maximized in these labs and that modifications can increase student enjoyment and change classroom behavior. This research also provides a template for how a multi-pronged assessment approach can simultaneously measure the effects of pedagogical changes on perceptions, behaviors and outcomes of students.\nKeywords; active learning, assessment, biology laboratory, COPUS, evidence-based instructional practices\n",
