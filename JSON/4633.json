        "Description/Abstract": "A growing group of green writers are persuading people to change their thinking and their behaviors for the benefit of our planet and its inhabitants. Adding a green writing assignment, unit, or course to your curriculum, the author argues, is an excellent strategy for showing students how their writing can make a difference in their community. This article discusses the design of a green writing course and offers suggestions for incorporating a green writing component in your discipline-specific courses.",
