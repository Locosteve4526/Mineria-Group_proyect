        "Description/Abstract": "The extent to which mental health services for youths embody system-of-care (SOC) principles is an important quality indicator. This study tested whether youth and family experiences of SOC principles varied depending on youths' level of need after adjusting for sociodemographic and treatment factors. The relationship to caregiver-reported clinical outcomes was also examined. Using administrative data and cross-sectional surveys from a stratified random sample of 1124 caregivers of youths ages 5-20 within a statewide system, adjusted analyses indicated caregivers of youths with the most intensive needs were significantly less likely to report receiving care that embodied SOC principles, with deficits on six of nine items. Youths whose services embodied SOC principles experienced significantly greater improvement in caregiver-reported functioning even after adjusting for level of need. Results highlight disparities in SOC principles for youths with intensive needs and the need for policy and intervention development to improve care for this population.",
