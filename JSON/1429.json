        "Description/Abstract": "This reflective work may be perceived as irreverent, given the nature of our times and the mandates of No Child Left Behind (2002), yet its intention is merely meant to be reflective and not irreverent. Our intentions were to use the book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Rowley 2003) as an analogy with which to analyze the current state of education in the U.S.A. and the implementation and implications of No Child Left Behind (NCLB). What we discovered was a tantalizing conversation that revealed, irreverently but intriguingly, the magic of Harry Potter's Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, and the mysteries of NCLB. We used the contexts of Hogwarts and current trend in public education to analyze curriculum and instruction as it is portrayed in schools working to meet accountability structures, structures necessary to work with at-risk (and resilient) youth, and how the culture of supervision is enacted in situations that are not connected to authentic instruction for student understanding (Newman, Secada, &amp; Wehlage, 1995).",
