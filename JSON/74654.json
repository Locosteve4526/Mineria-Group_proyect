        "Description/Abstract": "Reindeer herding is one of the oldest livelihoods in Finland. The Reindeer Husbandry Act guarantees the members of 54 reindeer herding cooperatives the right to graze reindeer freely on both private and state land on more than a third of Finland's territory. Different types of land use, such as mining and forestry, and accelerating climate change are requiring herders to adapt in entirely new ways. This paper reports on recent ethnographic and community-based research with Finnish reindeer herders. The impacts of new development projects on traditional livelihoods and environment are typically assessed individually. Development projects beginning in the 1970s, including hydroelectric dam construction, mining, industrial-scale silviculture, and most recently wind-park development, have put multilayered constraints on reindeer foraging and reindeer herders\u2019 practices.\u00a0 This project is conducting knowledge co-production with Finnish reindeer herder/social scientists to understand the cascading impacts of development, including direct and indirect loss of pasture, changes in reindeer migration routes, capital and recurring expenses, animal well-being, navigating bureaucracy, and overall increased workload for reindeer herders. This interdisciplinary project seeks to understand how these effects intersect with future climate change scenarios that impact traditional lifeways, community well being, and the future of reindeer herding in the region.",
