        "Description/Abstract": "Issues in the development of location privacy theory are identified and organized based on both technological considerations and more general privacy theories. Three broad categories containing six issues are described: location (including sensing methods and location properties), privacy (including definition and subject identification), and information flows (from location information acquisition through storage, use, and sharing). An influence diagram model is presented which relates these issues in context and may serve as a basis for further theory development, empirical research, and public policy discussion.",
