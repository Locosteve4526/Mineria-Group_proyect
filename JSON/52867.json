        "Description/Abstract": "For D=73, the least x for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 94. The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 97, but the smallest x in this case is 10, which is less than 97. The next prime, D, after 97 for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 109 and the least x for which it has a solution is 9532, which is larger than 97, so it is a new record value. 73 is a term for this sequence and 94 qualifies for membership to A336795, but 97 does not qualify because the least x for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is not a record value.",
