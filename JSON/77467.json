        "Description/Abstract": "Over the past 20\u00a0years, palliative care in the United States has grown significantly. Yet, access to and/or engagement with palliative care for minoritized persons with serious illness remains limited. In addition, the focus of palliative and end-of-life care research has not historically focused on equity-informed intervention development that collaborates directly with minoritized populations. Equity-informed interventions within palliative and end-of-life care research have the potential to champion collaborations with persons with serious illness and their families to mitigate health inequities. The purpose of this scoping review was to examine and describe the literature on the approaches used in the design and development of palliative and end-of-life care interventions with minoritized populations with serious illness.",
