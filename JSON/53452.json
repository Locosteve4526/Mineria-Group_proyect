        "Description/Abstract": "The shift to remote learning in early 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity for many instructors to rethink their approach to teaching and to consider student learning beyond content delivery. This global moment has highlighted the need for increased awareness and understanding of evidence-based approaches to pedagogy at many of our academic institutions and across the field of linguistics. \n\nInstructors who are engaged in scholarly teaching take an informed and reflective approach to improving their teaching practices with the goal of enhancing student learning. Some of this work has been shared publicly through presentations and publications in the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL). The goal of this session is to share and reflect on strategies used by linguists during the shift to remote teaching/learning, as informed by best practices, in addition to discussing the effect of the shift on teaching and learning in the field of linguistics.",
