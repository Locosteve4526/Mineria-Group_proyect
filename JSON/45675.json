Join us for a Best in Show-style showcase of some lightweight apps you can easily implement in and out of the classroom to increase engagement and foster active learning. Three apps will go head to head in a quickfire demo and then you, the audience, will become the judges and award the Best In Show ribbon. Walk away from this session with some new tools and engagement strategies to experiment with back home.",
