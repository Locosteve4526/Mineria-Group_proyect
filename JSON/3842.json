        "Description/Abstract": "We observed remarkable oscillatory forces with amplitude of 60-90?nN and  periodicity of 3\u20134 water molecule diameters in an ambient environment  between two silicon surfaces as the tip-sample distance decreased using  the cantilever-based optical interfacial force microscope with lateral  modulation. As the humidity increased, the oscillatory forces changed  from being large at lower relative humidities, below 40%, to  progressively becoming smaller as the humidity went higher than 40%. The  frequency of oscillatory forces increased with the existence of lateral  tip-modulation and with the slower approaching tip-speed. Its starting  point distance has been found to originate from the topographic water  structure.",
