        "Description/Abstract": "As spoken dialogue systems and chatbots are gaining more widespread adoption,\ncommercial and open-sourced services for natural language understanding are\nemerging. In this paper, we explain how we altered the open-source RASA natural\nlanguage understanding pipeline to process incrementally (i.e., word-by-word),\nfollowing the incremental unit framework proposed by Schlangen and Skantze. To\ndo so, we altered existing RASA components to process incrementally, and added\nan update-incremental intent recognition model as a component to RASA. Our\nevaluations on the Snips dataset show that our changes allow RASA to function\nas an effective incremental natural language understanding service.\n[Journal_ref: ]",
