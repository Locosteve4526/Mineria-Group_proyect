        "Description/Abstract": "Boise State University librarians Erin Passehl and Amy Vecchione were invited by the 2010 Idaho Library Association Conference Planning Committee to present on the topic of &quot;creating digital archives.&quot; Idaho is a state that currently lacks a centralized digital repository or consortium and, as a result, there are libraries and historical societies around the state without the training or skills to create digital collections. Yet these organizations have rich collections pertinent to the history of Idaho, ranging from original manuscripts to historic photos.",
