        "Description/Abstract": "During the mid- and Late Cretaceous period, North America was split by the north\u2013south oriented Western Interior Seaway. Its role in creating and maintaining Late Cretaceous global greenhouse conditions remains unclear.

The southward extent of relatively cool, low-salinity, low-?18O surface waters critically distinguishes among these models, but past studies of invertebrates could not independently assess water temperature and isotopic compositions. Here we present oxygen isotopes in biophosphate from coeval marine turtle and fish fossils from western Kansas, representing the east central seaway, and from the Mississippi embayment, representing the marginal Tethys Ocean. Our analyses yield precise seawater isotopic values and geographic temperature differences during the main transition from the Coniacian to the early Campanian age (87\u201382 Myr), and indicate that the seaway oxygen isotope value and salinity were 2\u2030 and 3\u2030 lower, respectively, than in the marginal Tethys Ocean. We infer that the influence of northern freshwater probably reached as far south as Kansas. Our revised values imply relatively large temperature differences between the Mississippi embayment and central seaway, explain the documented regional latitudinal palaeobiogeographic zonationhttp://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1312.html#ref4&quot; id=&quot;x-x-ref-link-4&quot; title=&quot;Kauffman, E. in Jurassic-Cretaceous Biochronology and Paleogeography of North America (ed.
