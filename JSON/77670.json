        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;The Caitlin Clark Effect is a term that describes the impact of the University of Iowa basketball player on the popularity of women\u2019s basketball, which occurred in conjunction with Clark\u2019s record-breaking performances in 2023 and 2024, as well as the Iowa team\u2019s successes in the NCAA championship tournament. While the Caitlin Clark Effect is associated with intense media attention, ticket sales, and viewership, it also illuminates significant and lesser-known aspects of women\u2019s sport history, specifically media coverage, the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), and the state of Iowa\u2019s unique basketball heritage and \u20186-on-6\u2019 basketball rules. The purpose of this article is to present these three topics as important historical foundations underlying the Caitlin Clark Effect. More importantly, these three topics help to demonstrate the complex and uneven movement towards equitable, visible, and valued women\u2019s sports participation in the US\u2014in other words, social change.&lt;/span&gt;",
