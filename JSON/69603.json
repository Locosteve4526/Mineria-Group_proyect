It situates\u00a0ACorporation, Inc. within the long history of legal requirements for corporate social responsibility, the evolution of the concept of corporate personhood, and the use of law for expressive purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It then examines the advocacy program embodied in\u00a0ACorporation\u2019s\u00a0work to have states treat concepts of corporate personhood in the same manner as natural persons, such as through appointment of corporate guardians, treatment of corporate mergers as marriages, and selective service requirements. By adding the work of social practice artists to those of historians, jurists, and business ethicists, it offers a new perspective on corporate identity and social responsibility",
