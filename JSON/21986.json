        "Description/Abstract": "We propose to develop DNA-based self-assembly into a novel manufacturing process for the fabrication of nanoscale substrates and devices for defense, semiconductor, and biomedical applications. When compared to state-of-the-art technology, DNA-based nanotechnology is capable of manufacturing trillions of identical devices that are smaller, faster, and less expensive.  Transformative by nature, our DNA-based self assembly research will focus on: 1) the optimization of the technology for device fabrication, 2) the development of molecular components and machines that can be assembled into integrated circuits and scaffolds, and 3) the creation of nanostructures and devices for medical diagnosis or therapeutics, such as cancer detection, and self-healing materials.  This project ultimately seeks to design, build, and control complex systems, one molecule at a time, using life\u2019s building blocks.",
