        "Description/Abstract": "An optically activated switch comprising amorphous material which can be used to isolate and control\naccess to a circuit. The optically activated switch can be used as an access transistor or selector device\nfor a resistive or memristive memory element. It can also be used as an optically gated amplifier, and as\na wavelength converter device. The device has a saturation current magnitude dependent on the incident\nlight intensity and wavelength. The saturation current can be used to program a memristor or resistive\nmemory element to continuous states. In some embodiments, the phototransistor or detector may\ninclude optically-gated transistors (OGTs), fabricated using doped amorphous GeSe films designed with\nhigh selectivity and used in a circuit to access and program the memristor device. In some embodiments,\nthe device can be used to program a large array with an optical pattern.",
