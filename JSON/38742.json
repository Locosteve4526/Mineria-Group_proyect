        "Description/Abstract": "  There is no question regarding the place of the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family in the history of the Reformation in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.  It is widely accepted in historiography that the Reformation in Lithuania had a more significant and longer lasting impact than in Poland, thanks to its strong protectors, Janusz and Bogus\u0142aw Radziwi\u0142\u0142.  But after their death, it is said, the Counter-Reformation was triumphant and Protestantism lost its influence in the political and cultural life of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  According to Jerzy Ochma\u0144ski, the end of the 17th century saw the downfall of Protestantism in Lithuania.\r\n\r\n\r\n            My research takes issue with that perspective, and that simplistic view of historiography.  I have studied the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 clientele and women\u2019s influence upon it, but this article will examine the multi-ethnic and multi-confessional character of the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 household and the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 clientele.  Excellent work has been done by Adam Teller, Moshe Rosman, and others looking at the centrality of Jewish agency in making the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 fortune, but their work ignores the contributions of other religious minority groups.  Far from disappearing, even in the 18th century there were functioning Protestant and flourishing Uniate religious communities within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, notably in Radziwi\u0142\u0142 towns and political strongholds.  My article will be a part of a larger microhistory of the town of Kiejdany, (K\u0117dainiai), and I contend that one of the sources of this family\u2019s power was its ability to navigate intergroup relations well. \r\n\r\n ",
