        "Description/Abstract": "Uncertainty is often presented in the literature as a barrier to chronic kidney disease (CKD) management and end stage renal disease (ESRD) planning by individuals, but the definition of uncertainty has not been clarified for individuals with CKD. After reviewing the literature, a conceptual definition for uncertainty in individuals with CKD was developed. To further clarify this concept, exemplars of individuals with CKD who do and do not exhibit uncertainty are offered. This concept clarification may offer nephrology nurses additional insight into assessing and caring for individuals with CKD.",
