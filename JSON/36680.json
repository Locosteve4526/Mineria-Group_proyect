        "Description/Abstract": "These sculptures engage with the ideas inherent in using sound as a medium for art while not employing sound as a medium. This ongoing series of works uses the loudspeaker as a conduit to explore ideas of the use of sound in art. While none of the speakers produce sound, they each attempt to express ideas of aural experience. By omitting sonic phenomena from sound art, we can examine issues around sonic practice without recourse to the inherent visceral experience of sound.",
