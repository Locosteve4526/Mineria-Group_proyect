In this session, you will rotate in groups through a variety of emerging technology stations where you will explore and brainstorm how you can incorporate each tool into your own curriculum. Each station focuses on a specific technology and will have an informational sheet that includes instructions and possible learning outcomes. We\u2019ll conclude with a discussion on how to apply what we learned.",
