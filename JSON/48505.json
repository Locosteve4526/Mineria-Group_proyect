        "Description/Abstract": "Salmonella enterica\u00a0serovar Typhimurium is a bacterial pathogen that causes many food borne illnesses in the United States. According to the CDC, most cases results in fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. In severe cases individuals infected with Salmonella have to be hospitalized, and in the United States about 450 cases result in death each year.\u00a0Salmonella contains an enterotoxin, which is a protein toxin released by the bacteria that will target the intestines. The enterotoxin in S. Typhimurium is called artAB and contains two subunits; an A subunit and a B subunit. The A subunit is responsible for enzymatic activity while the B subunit enables binding to the intestinal cells. Our goal is to isolate and clone the artA subunit of this toxin by itself with a 6XHIS affinity tag. artA-HIS will then be purified and tested for ADP-ribosylation activity, or toxin activity, in vitro. The data collected will give us a greater understanding of the function and activity of this toxin and will help determine the role that artAB plays in the pathogenesis of\u00a0Salmonella.\n",
