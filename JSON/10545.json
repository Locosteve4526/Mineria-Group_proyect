        "Description/Abstract": "Traditionally, information and scholarship produced by universities has  been disseminated by for-profits publishers who charge for access to  this scholarship. This approach to sharing the output of our nation's  academic community has significantly limited access to that scholarship.  Institutional repositories are revolutionizing how university-based  information is made accessible to society as a whole. This presentation  will explore how libraries are supporting access to academic  scholarship, issues involved in providing the scholarship such as types  of information, intellectual property, and quality control, and ways  users can access, evaluate, and utilize university-based information.\n",
