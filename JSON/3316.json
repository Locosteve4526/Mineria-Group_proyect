        "Description/Abstract": "After outlining some striking similarities between ethnic food marketing and multicultural literature, I intend to analyze the role of food in contemporary German literature and society. Specifically, I will look at two texts by Rafik Schami (&quot;Kebab ist Kultur&quot;) and Uwe Timm (Die Entdeckung der Currywurst). In both of these texts, food plays a crucial role. In &quot;Kebab ist Kultur,&quot; food is a marker of difference and alterity. In Die Entdeckung der Currywurst, food is the impetus to trace history - personal history as well as the history of postwar Germany. Questions related to cultural differences, history, and memory have been highly contested within German society, and I am therefore convinced they will continue to play an important role in German literature and German studies.",
