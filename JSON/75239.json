        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;The impact of companies\u2019 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies and practices on corporate value is a hotly debated issue in the literature. We address the impact of corporate LGBTQ inclusiveness, a social dimension of ESG that requires extra effort and cost, using the COVID pandemic as a natural experiment. We examine the association between ratings of organizations based on their policies and activities in support of LGBTQ employees and the LGBTQ community, the Corporate Equality Index (CEI), and corporate long-term value, \u00a0Tobin\u2019s Q. We show that CEI rankings before the pandemic are positively and significantly related to Tobin\u2019s Q in 2020 and the change in Tobin\u2019s Q from 2019 to 2020. Also, panel data analysis shows that the positive impact of CEI on Tobin\u2019s Q is more salient in 2020. This study provides evidence that ESG investments in diversity help protect corporate value, especially during this crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;",
