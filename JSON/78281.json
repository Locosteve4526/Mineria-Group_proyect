        "Description/Abstract": "The mechanical resilience of the knee meniscus is provided by a group of structural proteins in the extracellular matrix. Aging can alter the quantity and molecular structure of these proteins making the meniscus more susceptible to debilitating tears. In this study, we determined the effect of aging on the quantity of structural proteins and collagen crosslinks in human lateral meniscus, and examined whether the quantity of these molecules was predictive of tensile toughness (area under the stress-strain curve). Two age groups were tested: a young group under 40 and an older group over 65 years old. Using mass spectrometry, we quantified the abundance of proteins and collagen crosslinks in meniscal tissue that was adjacent to\u00a0the dumbbell-shaped specimens used to measure uniaxial tensile toughness parallel or perpendicular to the circumferential fiber orientation. We found that the enzymatic collagen crosslink deoxypyridinoline had a significant positive correlation with toughness, and reductions in the quantity of this crosslink with aging were associated with a loss of toughness in the ground substance and fibers. The non-enzymatic collagen crosslink carboxymethyl-lysine increased in quantity with aging, and these increases corresponded to reductions in ground substance toughness. For the collagenous (Types I, II, IV, VI, VIII) and non-collagenous structural proteins (elastin, decorin, biglycan, prolargin) analyzed in this study, only the quantity of collagen VIII was predictive of toughness. This study provides valuable insights on the structure-function relationships of the human meniscus, and how aging causes structural adaptations that weaken the tissue's mechanical integrity.",
