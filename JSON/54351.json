        "Description/Abstract": "This panel explores ways instructor identity, faculty satisfaction, and student engagement are complicated by digital and institutional constraints. What happens when erasure or alteration of instructor presence occurs in these spaces? How can we avoid harm and increase justice while  employing efficient yet impersonal digital technologies to assess faculty performance through student evaluations of writing instructors? How are student engagement and faculty regard (self- and other) complicated by evaluative structures and digital course platforms that may produce erasure? And what happens to student engagement when writing instructor presence is framed online by an institution? The panel invites a conversation about these constraints and their effects as well as interventions: strategies to enhance strengths-based teaching assessments and instructor presence.\n",
