        "Description/Abstract": "With 230 attendees from 48 states, Canada, Europe and Australia, \u201c21st Century Music School Design\u201d will be unlike the familiar academic conference. Music educators will share ideas, learn from one another and collaborate, focusing on three questions \u2013 one specific question each day: Why are we here? What should we teach? How do we make this change happen?\r\n\r\nSponsored by The College Music Society, \u201cCMS Summit: 21st Century Music School Design\u201d will be held at the University of South Carolina School of Music June 3-5, 2016.\r\n\r\nThe summit will consider solutions music schools can take to best prepare students for today's realities \u2013 not through an inflexible formula \u2013 but by defining and designing distinct approaches relevant to each music program\u2019s mission. Participants should emerge with a concrete framework for advancing change within their home institutions.\r\n",
