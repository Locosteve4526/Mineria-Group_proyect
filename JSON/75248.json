        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;This study investigates how specific characteristics of an item's listing may influence the purchasing decisions of participants in an online auction. Initially, we examine whether the length of the item listing (i.e., its wordiness) and the presence of herding bias are associated with variations in the likelihood of the item being successfully sold. Building on these findings, we further explore the moderating effects of rhetoric emphasizing quality and the use of vague terminology on these relationships. Utilizing computer-aided text analysis, we assess the extent to which these attributes are present in the descriptions of 230,270 auction items. Our analysis reveals robust support for herding bias as a positive predictor of an item\u2019s likelihood of sale. Additionally, we identify an optimal listing length, where excessive wordiness reduces the probability of a sale. Finally, we find that both higher levels of quality rhetoric and vagueness negatively moderate the effects of herding bias and listing length on auction outcomes consistent with institutional theory\u2019s assertion that efforts to extend legitimacy when information asymmetry is prevalent can result in perceptions of protesting too much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;",
