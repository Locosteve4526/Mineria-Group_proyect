        "Description/Abstract": " Perinatal depression affects 5-15% of childbearing women. However, literature suggests that Latina women are twice as likely to experience depression during pregnancy. Group telehealth-based interventions are a promising approach to increasing access and reducing barriers to mental health. However, little is known about the experience that Latinas have with navigating this approach. This paper aimed to explore Latina mothers' perspectives and recommendations in using telehealth to deliver a mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy (MBCBT) group intervention.  Fourteen pregnant or postpartum women participated in focus groups and individual interviews. Interview topics included perinatal depression, knowledge and content of interventions, and the feasibility and acceptability of the telehealth approach. Data were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach.  Three broad themes emerged; (1) accessibility to telehealth, (2) relational connection through technology, and (3) technological issues affecting access (i.e., level of familiarity with portal, video quality, etc.). Enhancers promoting participation in the telehealth intervention included reduced scheduling concerns and no need for childcare. Barriers included mistrust of providers' engagement, concerns about privacy, and potential for lack of relational connection through technology.  Specific recommendations were provided to increase participation and effectiveness of telehealth groups among Latinas.",
