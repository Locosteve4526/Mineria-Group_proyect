        "Description/Abstract": "Next to media themselves, pedagogy or education \u2013configured specifically as a \u201ctraining the senses\u201d (McLuhan &amp; Leonard, 1967) or \u201csensuous education\u201d (McLuhan, 1964)\u2013 is one of the most prominent themes in McLuhan\u2019s corpus. It is the focus of numerous articles published throughout his career and of two significant albeit relatively obscure monographs that effectively book-end his work on electronic media. As Janine Marchessault says, McLuhan articulates \u201ca specifi cally argued pedagogical enterprise\u201d that is central to his \u201caesthetically-based, highly performative and historically grounded..contribution to the study of media\u201d (xi, 10, 34). In this paper, I focus on McLuhan\u2019s pedagogical enterprise specifically as it develops from his highly original understanding of the senses. In doing so, I also show how McLuhan\u2019s contribution to media is indeed aesthetically, historically and performatively charged, and make the case for the ongoing currency of his pedagogical enterprise today.",
