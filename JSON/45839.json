        "Description/Abstract": "Academic libraries are responsible for providing accessible copies of collection materials to individuals facing a variety of accessibility needs. Accessibility needs differ from user to user, often making each request an individualized service. However, do academic libraries have a responsibility to embrace a Universal Design for Learning approach to their acquisitions process? Do academic library workers need to establish policies as part of the procurement process? This research surveyed academic libraries at institutions similar to Boise State University in size, graduate program offerings, and within the same region to help answer the questions: how academic libraries in the Northwest United States establish practices, policies, procedures, and workflows to meet these needs, and: how do academic libraries currently meet these needs when providing streaming media services, and other collection materials, to users with accessibility needs?",
