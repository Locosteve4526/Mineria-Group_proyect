        "Description/Abstract": "The synthesis and single crystal X-ray structure of trans-[HNC6H7][Cr(NCS)4(NC6H7)2] (1) and mer-[Cr(NCS)3(NC6H7)3] (2) are reported. Compound 1 was synthesized by refluxing chromium powder and thiourea in  4-methylpyridine. The isothiocyanate ligand is believed to be generated  from the isomerization of thiourea to ammonium thiocyanate during  synthesis. Compound 2 was prepared from CrCl3 and KSCN in 4-methylpyridine. The reaction conditions for both compounds yielded a mixture of [Cr(NCS)x(NC6H7)6?x]3?x isomers (x = 0\u20136), which were analyzed by HPLC. The thermal properties of trans-[HNC6H7][Cr(NCS)4(NC6H7)2]  were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning  calorimetry\u2013mass spectroscopy (TGA/DSC\u2013MS), and the compound was found  to oxidize to CrO2 in three major weight loss steps when heated to 1000 \u00b0C in dry air.",
