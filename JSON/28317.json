        "Description/Abstract": "Prior research has found that expertise of those charged with risk management governance within an organization is an important determinant of enterprise risk management (ERM) quality. An important facet of overall ERM quality is communication with stakeholders. In this paper we examine and find that existence and expertise of a Chief Risk Officer and Risk Committee are positively associated with the volume of risk factor disclosure provided to stakeholders. We also examine how expertise affects the market reaction to these disclosures and find evidence consistent with an attenuated market reaction to longer disclosures when a Chief Risk Officer is more experienced, but find no evidence of a differential market reaction when there is a more experienced Risk Committee. Overall, this research suggests experience affects risk factor communication and that the market considers experience of the CRO when reacting to this information. This research is clearly important to investors, as well as regulators who are interested in the efficacy of the recently enacted risk factor disclosure requirement.",
