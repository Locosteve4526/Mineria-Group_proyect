        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;We examined hyporheic metabolism in Watershed 1 (WS01), a stream draining a forested headwater catchment at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. We compared measurements from a well network with those from six, 2-meter long hyporheic mesocosms. The patterns in hyporheic metabolism were similar in both the well network and the mesocosms. Oxygen (O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;) concentrations declined and those of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) increased with travel time. However, the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) changed little. The mesocosms showed that net losses of DOC could only account for 7% of O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; consumed during summer and fall sampling periods, whereas in the winter and spring, net losses of DOC could account for 24% of O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; consumed. Previous research in WS01 has shown that hyporheic exchange is large, relative to discharge, thus in-stream DOC is continually processed through the hyporheic zone, limiting the accumulation of bioavailable DOC. Consequently, hyporheic respiration in this forested headwater stream relies primarily on sediment bound or buried organic matter (POC) as a source of organic carbon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;We modeled the consumption of O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; and the production of DIC as zero-order kinetic reactions (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;DIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;, respectively). Both &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;DIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; were correlated to temperature in the mesocosms, and were two-fold higher on warmer (summer-fall) compared to cooler (winter-spring) sampling dates. However, neither &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; nor &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;DIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; showed seasonal differences within the well network. We also compared the rate constants to initial stream water DOC concentrations, and for the mesocosms, time since packing. We expected that both &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;DIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; would show similar relationships because O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; and DIC should be tightly coupled through aerobic respiration. That was not the case. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;DIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;, but not the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;, showed a weak relationship to stream water DOC concentrations. Also, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;DIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; was strongly correlated with time since packing the mesocosms. These results suggest that sediment disturbance or incorporation of relatively fresh organic matter from packing the mesocosms increased the bioavailability of the POC. Further, changes in concentration of O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;, DOC, and DIC versus travel time were approximately linear in both the mesocosms and the well field. These data suggest that the WS01 hyporheic zone is severely carbon limited, and the processes that release bioavailable DOC from POC are relatively constant along hyporheic flow paths and govern the rate of hyporheic metabolism.&lt;/span&gt;",
