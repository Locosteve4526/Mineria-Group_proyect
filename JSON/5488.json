        "Description/Abstract": "Spasticity is characterized by velocity dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes and tendon jerks. Many people affected by spasticity receive late or no treatment, which greatly reduces the potential to regain full motor control and function restoration. There is much to consider before determining treatment for people with spasticity. Treatment of pediatric patients increases the complexity of treatment because of the substantial difference between adult and pediatric spasticity.  Proper patient evaluation, utilization of scales and measures, and obtaining patient and caregiver history is vital in determining optimal spasticity treatment. Further, taking into consideration the limitations and desires of individuals serve as a guide to best management. We have grouped contributing factors into the acronym IDAHO Criteria, to elucidate a multidisciplinary approach that considers a person's complete field of experiences. This model is applied to goal setting and recognizes the importance of a spasticity management team comprised of the subject person, his/her family, the environment, and a supportive, well informed medical staff.  This criterion takes into account the complexity associated with diagnosing and treating spasticity, with the ultimate goal of improved function. ",
