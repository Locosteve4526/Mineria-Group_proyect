        "Description/Abstract": "Collagen is a major component of the newly synthesized pericellular  microenvironment of chondrocytes. Collagen types II, IX, and XI are  synthesized and assembled into higher ordered complexes by a mechanism  in which type XI collagen plays a role in nucleation of new fibrils, and  in limiting fibril diameter. This study utilizes a cell line derived  from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma that allows the accumulation and  assembly of pericellular matrix. Immunofluorescence and atomic force  microscopy were used to assess early intermediates of fibril formation.  Results indicate that this cell line synthesizes and secretes  chondrocyte-specific pericellular matrix molecules including types II,  IX, and XI collagen and is suitable for the study of newly synthesized  collagen matrix under the experimental conditions used. AFM data  indicate that small fibrils or assemblies of microfibrils are detectable  and may represent precursors of the ?20 nm thin fibrils reported in  cartilage. Treatment with hyaluronidase indicates that the dimensions of  the small fibrils may be dependent upon the presence of hyaluronan  within the matrix. This study provides information on the composition  and organization of the newly synthesized extracellular matrix that  plays a role in establishing the material properties and performance of  biological materials such as cartilage.",
