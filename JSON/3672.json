        "Description/Abstract": "Background: The purposes of this study were to describe and analyze the steps/d of nonwhite minority children and youth by gender, grade level, race/ethnicity, and mode of school transportation. A secondary purpose was to compare the steps/d of minority children and youth to their Caucasian grade-level counterparts.  Methods: Participants were 547 minority youth grades 5 to 8 from 4 urban schools. Participants wore sealed pedometers for 6 consecutive week/school days. Three hundred and ten participants responded to a questionnaire concerning their mode of transportation to and from school. Results: Statistical analyses indicated a main effect for gender (F(3,546) = 13.50, P &lt; .001) with no interaction. Boys (12,589 \u00b1 3921) accumulated significantly more steps/d than girls (9,539 \u00b1 3,135). Further analyses also revealed a significant main effect for mode of school transportation (F(2, 309) = 15.97, P &lt; .001). Walkers (12,614 \u00b1 4169) obtained significantly more steps/d than car (10,021 \u00b1 2856) or bus (10,230 \u00b1 3666) transit users. Conclusions: Minority boys obtain similar steps/d as their Caucasian grade-level counterparts; minority girls obtain less steps/d than their Caucasian grade-level counterparts. Minority youth who actively commute are more likely to meet PA recommendations than nonactive commuters.",
