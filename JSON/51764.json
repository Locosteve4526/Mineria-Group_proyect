        "Description/Abstract": "This article offers a racial analysis of security in Colombia. I describe the racist underpinnings of government \u2018citizen security\u2019 and \u2018democratic security\u2019 projects by highlighting a rural peace community\u2019s cross ethnic solidarity network against militarization. I also analyze the racial and colonial dimensions of Colombian peace communities\u2019 use of unarmed international accompaniers as protection from attacks. As such, resistance to insecurity is a window into complex processes of racialization, toward conceptual critiques of security and anti-racist security methodologies.",
