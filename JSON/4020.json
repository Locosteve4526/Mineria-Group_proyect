        "Description/Abstract": "Descriptive data on 100 juveniles seen for assessment and treatment at a nonprofit, community-based, outpatient treatment program for sexual abuse are presented. Prior physical and sexual abuse characteristics of the juvenile sexual offender (JSO) are discussed as well as the incidence of victimization and perpetration within the offender's family. Statistically significant associations emerged for the following characteristics: (a) prior physical and sexual victimization of the offender and having another family member identified as a perpetrator of sexual abuse; (b) prior sexual victimization of the offender and prior sexual victimization of another family member; and (c) a history of sexual abuse of the offender and having a family member with prior sexual victimization.",
