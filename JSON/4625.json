        "Description/Abstract": "This article is about Rabindranath Tagore's construction of the new bhadramahila in \u201cThe Wife's Letter\u201d (1914) and The Home and the World (1915). In particular, the arguments focus on the constitution of \u201cindependent\u201d women subjects by three interrelated authorial strategies: first, the modification of the home to repurpose gender relations; second, the importance of the \u201cLotus feet\u201d or charan in the reconstitution of the new bhadramahila, and, third, the establishment of the benevolent, reformed bhadralok as the saviour. In conclusion, the article states that even if Tagore considered \u201cthe women's question\u201d in a pragmatic manner, he saw it more as a social, rather than as a political, problem. Therefore, he could not liberate the female protagonists completely. Instead, he reconstitutes the home as a \u201clocus of the unconquered and uncompromised [space] under the tutelage of the reformed bhadralok and reaffirming women's subordinate position\u201d (Mitra 247).",
