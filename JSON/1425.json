        "Description/Abstract": "Benedict Prairie is a small railroad prairie that is owned and managed by the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee Field Station. A floristic survey of the 2.5 ha site was conducted from 1988 to 1990. A total of 191 species, representing 51 families were identified, including Asclepias purpurascens and Parthenium integrifolium, which are protected in Wisconsin. This list was compared to two others compiled previously for the site. Compilation of all three lists brings the total number of species recorded from the site to 231, but reveals that a number of species appear to have been extirpated.",
