        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent scholarship has argued that three modern charitable giving practices (limited liability companies, donor-advised funds, and strategic corporate giving) undermine public trust in the charitable sector and violate the \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d reached between elite donors and Congress and embodied in the private foundation rules enacted in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. In this article, we critique this scholarship by comparing each modern giving practice with the terms of the Grand Bargain. While we agree that donor advised funds violate the Grand Bargain and undermine trust in our charitable system, we explain that limited liability companies and strategic corporate giving are less of a concern. In particular, we explore the mysteries of corporate charitable giving and show that it has long been strategic (rather than altruistic) and that the Grand Bargain arguably is irrelevant in the corporate context.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
