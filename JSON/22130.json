        "Description/Abstract": "Location-based services (LSBs) provide many benefits \u2013 to consumers, users, employers, and law enforcement, among others. However, they also often collect detailed, personal information about users \u2013 that tell not only where we are, who we are with, what we are doing, but perhaps even who we are. As yet, the law provides little regulation of LSBs or privacy protection with regard to location. A recent U.S. Supreme Court case, U.S. v. Jones, held that there is a privacy interest in location with regard to the 4th Amendment warrant requirement. However, whether and to what extent a right to privacy in one\u2019s location might apply outside of 4th Amendment purposes is unclear. The intent of this research is two-fold. First, it will explore recent court decisions and literature regarding locational privacy to determine its breadth. Second, it will explore emerging cultural studies research that addresses issues regarding online presentation of the self in terms of location to gain insight into the importance of locational privacy and provide guidance to courts and decision-makers.",
