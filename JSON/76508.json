        "Description/Abstract": "This study demonstrates an association between partisanship and institutional trust and mental\u00a0health help seeking. The 2022 Cooperative Election Study, administered by Harvard University\u00a0and YouGov, includes a national stratified sample; a subset (n=1,000) responded to additional\u00a0questions about mental health and were included in this study. Using regression models,\u00a0relationships between partisanship and mental health outcomes were analyzed. Findings indicate\u00a0Republicans are less likely than Democrats to report seeking help for mental health and are less\u00a0trusting of institutions that supply mental health information. Trust in state health departments is\u00a0moderated by the partisanship of the state the respondent lives in; Republicans are more trusting\u00a0of state health departments in states that are governed by Republicans than in states governed by&lt;br&gt;Democrats. Associations between partisanship and institutional trust and help seeking are large\u00a0and highlight the need for public health and mental health practitioners to study and consider\u00a0partisanship.",
