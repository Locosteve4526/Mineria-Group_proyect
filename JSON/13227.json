        "Description/Abstract": "In this presentation, I will describe curriculum, lesson plans and instructional theory in Canada and the USA. Over the past 50 years, the theory associated with these terms has become increasingly specific and prescriptive (rather than necessarily more critical or reflective). This allows my presentation to follow a roughly chronological in order. At the same time it allows me to move from general to specific, or from the macro through meso to micro levels of planning.",
