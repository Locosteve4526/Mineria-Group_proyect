        "Description/Abstract": "It is estimated that  a language dies every 14 days. With the death of the last speaker of each language, we lose invaluable worldly knowledge. One way to preserve this knowledge, and to delay language death is through language documentation and preservation. \nThe goal of this workshop is to inform refugees about the opportunity to participate in the Boise Language Project, an outreach project of the Boise State Linguistics Lab.",
