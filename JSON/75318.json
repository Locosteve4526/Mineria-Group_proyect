        "Description/Abstract": "            &lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0Sexual health behaviors among international students have gained prominence in recent years due to their increasing representation in global educational institutions.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0The present study explored sexual health behaviors in the context of condom usage, partner relationships, and student grade level.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0A substantial sample size of international students (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0= 13,242) was analyzed using a secondary data analysis of the 2022 American College Health Association\u2019s National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA) dataset, revealing noteworthy findings regarding sexual activities and condom usage.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0The findings indicate that a substantial proportion of international students engage in various sexual behaviors, including oral sex (50.8%), vaginal intercourse (51.3%), and anal intercourse (14.8%). Condom usage during sexual activities, particularly oral sex (4.1%) and anal sex (1.4%), was notably low. A multiple regression analysis rendered significance with sex, grade level, relationship, and number of partners as predictors of sexual health behaviors.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0The current study significantly contributes to the understanding of sexual health behaviors among international students. It underscores the importance of targeted interventions for promoting safe sex practices, the need for continuous access to sexual health resources, and the imperative for culturally sensitive and inclusive sex education programs on college campuses.&lt;/span&gt;        ",
