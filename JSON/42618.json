        "Description/Abstract": "This project explores the sociological significance of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) approach to corporate sustainability reporting (sustainability reporting).  Most sustainability reporting initiatives consist of a voluntary reporting framework, to be used and adapted at the whim of the reporting company.  SASB, by contrast, focuses on leveraging the existing legal definition of \u201cmaterial\u201d information for SEC reporting purposes.  The paper argues that SASB\u2019s unique focus reimagines sustainability reporting as mainstream disclosure, signaling societal change toward expanded corporate responsibilities.  The paper uses social constructionism to illustrate the connections between SASB\u2019s reimagining of \u201cmaterial\u201d information and what it tells us about ourselves as a society.  ",
