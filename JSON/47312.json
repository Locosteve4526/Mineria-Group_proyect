        "Description/Abstract": "We introduce the notion of directed diagrammatic reducibility which is a\nrelative version of diagrammatic reducibility. Directed diagrammatic\nreducibility has strong group theoretic and topological consequences. A\nmulti-relator version of the Freiheitssatz in the presence of directed\ndiagrammatic reducibility is given. Results concerning relative asphericity and\n$\\pi_1$-injectivity of subcomplexes are shown. We generalize the Corson/Trace\ncharacterization of diagrammatic reducibility to directed diagrammatic\nreducibility. We compare diagrammatic reducibility of relative presentations to\ndirected diagrammatic reducibility. Classical tools for showing diagrammatic\nreducibility, such as the weight test, the max/min test, and small cancellation\ntechniques are adapted to directed diagrammatic reducibility. The paper ends\nwith some applications to labeled oriented trees.\n[Journal_ref: ]",
