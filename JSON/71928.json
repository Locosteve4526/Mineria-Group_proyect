Yet during transitions of care consumer/caregiver needs and goals can become obscured, causing confusion and poor outcomes. This session will review standards for successful transitions of care, communication of critical information, and self-management of consumer/caregiver health through activation and engagement practices. The participant will leave with a \u201cchecklist\u201d of items to review at transitions of care and tips for how the consumer/caregiver can set the stage for a smooth transition between settings or providers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;",
