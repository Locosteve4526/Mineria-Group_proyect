        "Description/Abstract": "Over the past 15 years, several projects have been conducted to better understand racial/ethnic disparities (R/ED) in juvenile arrest rates in Idaho.\u00a0 Several of these projects have been focused on particular counties, and one has been comprehensive and statewide.\u00a0 Several other projects that were not specifically focused on R/ED but collected information about race/ethnicity have had their data reanalyzed with a \u2018R/ED lens\u2019 to better understand how risk and protective factors may be differentially distributed as a function of race/ethnicity.\u00a0 In the first section of the Phase 1 portion of this report, these findings are discussed collectively\u2014perhaps becoming the most comprehensive repository of what is known about RE/D in Idaho\u2019s juvenile justice history.\u00a0 In the following section of the Phase 1 portion of this report, several new R/ED-focused analyses are conducted on Progress Assessment/Reassessment (PA/R) data; some of these analyses focus on PA/R risk levels and some on progress in areas within PA/R domains.\u00a0 In the final section of the Phase 1 portion of the report, what was previously known about R/ED among arrested juveniles in Idaho is combined with what is now known from the new analyses, and recommendations for the Phase 2 portion of the current assessment are presented.",
