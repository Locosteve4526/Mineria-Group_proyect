        "Description/Abstract": "As the nascent RRN began to take shape its leadership, including then-director of CRS Susan McGrath, observed a consequential and somewhat\nsurprising gap. While many of the other major thematic areas regarding\nrefugee research\u2014international legal regimes, policy analysis, educational\nopportunities, and integration initiatives among them\u2014were key thematic\nareas for the network, environmental issues represented an important new\narea of both conceptual and practical concern, and largely fell beyond the\nrealm of refugee research proper. As a result, she sought to draw together\nscholars in this emergent field to help create a new research cluster with an\nemphasis on networking, interdisciplinarity, and knowledge generation.\nIn this chapter, we explore the successes and challenges of the Environmental Displacement Cluster with a particular focus on four areas\u20141) the\norigins and structure of the networking model; 2) making the case for\n\u201cenvironmentally induced displacement\u201d as a substantive conceptual field\nand our main organizing concept; 3) how our cluster enabled other interventions into knowledge production concerning our main organizing\nconcept; and 4) reflections on what has worked in this model and what\nremain as challenges moving forward.",
