        "Description/Abstract": "A mathematical model of the electrophotographic printing process has been developed. This model can be used\r\nmathematically for analysis, and to simulate the effects of these components on toner particle placement. The\r\nmodel\u2019s three main inputs, laser spread, charge to toner proportionality factor and toner particle size, produce\r\na wide variety of outputs. While the exact placement of toner particles is a random process, the total effect is\r\nnot. The effect of each model parameter on the ISO 13660 print quality attributes is noted and is described in\r\nthis paper. Particularly noted are the attributes line width, fill, raggedness and blurriness.",
