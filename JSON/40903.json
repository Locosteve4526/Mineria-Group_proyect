        "Description/Abstract": "Ice-sheet/ocean interaction in Greenland is one of the key outstanding challenges in climate modeling, yet present-day climate models are not able to resolve fine-scale processes in the fjords. This is due to orders of magnitude difference in spatial scales between the open ocean (~1000km) and fjord (&lt;1km) as well as small-scale processes at the glacier terminus, complicated bathymetry and coastline.\nThe NUMO project aims to address the issues arising in fjord modeling by developing a three-dimensional, unstructured mesh model using high-order Galerkin methods. Local non-conforming refinement allows for resolving particular areas of interests (i.e. ice-sheet / ocean interface), while maintaining coarser resolution in the rest of the domain.\nWe will present progress of the project, with the goal to develop a non-hydrostatic ocean model able to resolve ice-sheet / ocean interactions, circulation within the fjord and exchanges with the ocean. Recent developments include a streamlined modeling process from GIS bathymetry information (i.e. BedMachine 3.0), through 3D geometry modeling, meshing, and simulations. We will present both simplified (box-fjord) and more realistic (3D Sermilik Fjord) simulations.",
