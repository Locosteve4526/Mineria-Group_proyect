As they re-entered physical classrooms, many teachers took the chance to surface the best of remote instruction and blend it with the advantages of face-to-face meetings, seeking best practices in promoting student success. The unique mergers forming these hybrid spaces foster both complexity and opportunity for clarity. This panel discusses how navigating the complications of hybridity reveals the value of student agency in the learning environment, specifically in assessment processes that have traditionally been instructor centered. Student agency is a self-formative process where students participate in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;self-reflective and intentional, active engagement with their environments (Klemenc\u030cic\u030c, 2015). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Such self-directedness is a key agentive property of perceived self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;This formative practice aligns with the purpose of student assessment in that both are focused on growth. Our panel blends research, scholarship, and personal experience to illustrate a progressive, scaffolded approach to assessment for differing student populations, an approach that assists them in moving toward individual professional and academic goals.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
