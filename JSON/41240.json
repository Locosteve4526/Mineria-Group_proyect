Brown   \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Stout\n\nHeather Nesemeier   \nMinnesota State University Moorhead\n\nAli Gattoni   \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee\n\nStacey Mirviss-Jossart  \n\nSubmitter:\nAli Gattoni   \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee\n\nDescription:\nThis panel addresses an opportunity to create dialogue between tenure-track/full-time faculty and adjunct/temporary faculty. Creating this dialogue not only provides an opportunity to build faculty relationships but also can help adjunct/temporary faculty to feel more connected to their institution. Through this discussion, panel members will address key areas facing all faculty members such as building relationships and developing consistent practices for course planning and assessment, sharing teaching strategies and methods, and professional development. Panel participants will share the successes and challenges at their own institutions, providing insights into practices that might benefit other adjunct/temporary faculty as well as new faculty members.\n\nRationale:\nThis panel explores a growing need in the academic community: how can we create dialogue between full-time/tenure track faculty and adjunct/temporary faculty? Institutions may also benefit as faculty members build these relationships and develop a shared based of resources. By sharing different institutional experiences, we also open networking opportunities for adjunct and temporary faculty that may need guidance and support as they navigate the complexities of academic life.\n",
