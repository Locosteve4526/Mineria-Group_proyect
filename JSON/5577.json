        "Description/Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of pedometer use and self-regulation strategies on adolescents' daily physical activity.\nMethods: Junior high school students (n = 113) enrolled in seventh- and eighth-grade physical education classes (52 girls, 61 boys) volunteered to participate in a 5-week study to assess daily step counts. Ten physical education classes were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (a) self-regulation, (b) open, and (c) control.\nResults: A repeatedmeasures, mixed-model analysis of variance revealed a significant 3 \u00d7 4 (Group by Time) interaction effect, F6,290 = 2.64, P &lt; .02. Followup analyses indicated participants in the selfregulation group took 2071 to 4141 more steps/d than the control. No other significant differences emerged among groups on step counts. \nConclusions: It appears that having access to and charting daily step counts (ie, self-regulatory strategies) positively influenced young adolescents to attain a higher number of steps/d.",
