        "Description/Abstract": "Long-billed Curlew populations in western North America have declined in many portions of their range and curlews are recognized as a species of concern by many federal, state, and provincial agencies.  We've identified location-specific threats to curlews that occur in either the breeding or wintering ranges; however, it is also critical to step back and view their life cycle as a whole.  By looking at their full annual cycle we are able to better understand connectivity between wintering, stopover, and breeding grounds and how various threats in each time period might compound throughout the year.  We are examining limitations to breeding success in a variety of grassland and agricultural habitats in the western United States.  Because of specific threats to breeding curlews in southwestern Idaho, including direct shooting of adults, we are also conducting community education and outreach to help raise awareness about this declining population and reduce threats.  In addition, multiple partners are collaborating to describe the migratory connectivity patterns of Long-billed Curlews using satellite telemetry.  All told, including published and in progress data, IBO and partners have tracked individuals to and from well over 50% of breeding and non-breeding ranges. We will present movement details, compare results to prior work, consider threats to curlew populations, and discuss future objectives",
