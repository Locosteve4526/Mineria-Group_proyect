        "Description/Abstract": "Early diagnosis and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care settings remains complex. Nephrology nurses have the opportunity to positively impact this care trajectory. The Chronic Care Model has been applied as a means to improve chronic care management. A scoping review was conducted to identify how elements of the Chronic Care Model have been applied to CKD identification and early management in primary care settings. Elements of the Chronic Care Model were applied across studies and quality improvement projects to various degrees. Nurses, especially those with CKD knowledge, were highlighted as integral parts of successful interventions.",
