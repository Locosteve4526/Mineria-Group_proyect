        "Description/Abstract": "\u2018Map your Hazards\u2019 is an educational module developed within the NSF Interdisciplinary Teaching about Earth for a Sustainable Future program (InTeGrate). The module engages students in place-based explorations of natural hazards, social vulnerability, and the perception of natural hazards and risk. Students integrate geoscience and social science methodologies to (1) identify and assess hazards, vulnerability and risk within their communities; (2) distribute, collect and evaluate survey data (designed by authors) on the knowledge, risk perception and preparedness within their social networks; and (3) deliver a PPT presentation to local stakeholders detailing their findings and recommendations for development of a prepared, resilient community. \u2018Map your Hazards\u2019 underwent four rigorous assessments by a team of geoscience educators and external review before being piloted in our classrooms. The module was piloted in a 300-level \u2018Volcanoes and Society\u2019 course at Boise State University, a 300-level \u2018Environmental Sociology\u2019 course at Central Washington University, and a 100-level \u2018Natural Disasters and Environmental Geology\u2019 course at the College of Western Idaho. In all courses students reported a fascination with learning about the hazards around them and identifying the high risk areas in their communities. They were also surprised at the low level of knowledge, inaccurate risk perception and lack of preparedness of their social networks. This successful approach to engaging students in an interdisciplinary, place-based learning environment also has the broad implications of raising awareness of natural hazards (survey participants are provided links to local hazard and preparedness information). The data and preparedness suggestions can be shared with local emergency managers, who are encouraged to attend the student\u2019s final presentations. All module materials are published at serc.carleton.edu/integrate/ and are appropriate to a wide range of classrooms.\r\nExplanation of Other:  Educational Module ",
