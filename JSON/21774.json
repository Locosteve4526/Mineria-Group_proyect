        "Description/Abstract": "This study examines the effects of incentive contract framing on individuals\u2019 effort choices. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment in which participants assumed the role of employees under economically equivalent, but differently framed incentive contracts. Specifically, employees\u2019 costly effort decisions were framed as a bonus-only contract, penalty-only contract, clawback contract with a bonus greater than the potential penalty, or a clawback contract with a bonus less than the potential penalty. Additionally, we measured individual risk and loss preferences, perceptions of contract fairness, and expected disappointment as potential explanations for effort choice.  Prior research suggests that individuals\u2019 effort decisions are a result of loss aversion. We directly test this assertion, using an individual measure of loss aversion validated in prior research examining contract preference (Brink and Rankin 2013).  Using this measure of loss aversion, we find no evidence to support the assertion that participants\u2019 loss aversion impacts effort choices across contract frames. Consistent with an endowment effect, we find that contracts framed as clawback contracts (i.e., combination of bonus and penalty incentives) encourage higher effort choices than bonus-only contracts. Lastly, we find no evidence that clawback contract frames induce greater effort in comparison with bonus-only contract frames. \r\nRole:  Co-Principal",
