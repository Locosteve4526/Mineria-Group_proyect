        "Description/Abstract": "Organized every three years by the Boise Art Museum, the Idaho Triennial is a juried exhibition bringing together exemplary works of art created by a broad selection of Idaho artists. For the last 80 years, BAM has celebrated the creativity of artists living and working in Idaho, and the Museum\u2019s series of biennial and triennial exhibitions has become a respected and treasured tradition.\r\n\r\nThe juror for the 2017 Idaho Triennial is John D. Spiak, who has been the Director and Chief Curator of California State University Fullerton\u2019s Grand Central Art Center (GCAC) in Santa Ana since September of 2011. His curatorial emphasis is on contemporary art and society, with a focus on works in social practice and video. From 917 exceptional entries submitted by 180 artists from around the state, Spiak selected 41 works by 24 artists for the 2017 Idaho Triennial.",
