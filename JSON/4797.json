        "Description/Abstract": "DockoMatic is a free and open source application that unifies a\nsuite of software programs within a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to\nfacilitate molecular docking experiments. Here we describe the release of\nDockoMatic 2.0; significant software advances include the ability to (1) conduct\nhigh throughput inverse virtual screening (IVS); (2) construct 3D homology\nmodels; and (3) customize the user interface. Users can now efficiently setup, start,\nand manage IVS experiments through the DockoMatic GUI by specifying\nreceptor(s), ligand(s), grid parameter file(s), and docking engine (either\nAutoDock or AutoDock Vina). DockoMatic automatically generates the needed\nexperiment input files and output directories and allows the user to manage and\nmonitor job progress. Upon job completion, a summary of results is generated by\nDockomatic to facilitate interpretation by the user. DockoMatic functionality has\nalso been expanded to facilitate the construction of 3D protein homology models\nusing the Timely Integrated Modeler (TIM) wizard. The wizard TIM provides an interface that accesses the basic local alignment\nsearch tool (BLAST) and MODELER programs and guides the user through the necessary steps to easily and efficiently create\n3D homology models for biomacromolecular structures. The DockoMatic GUI can be customized by the user, and the software\ndesign makes it relatively easy to integrate additional docking engines, scoring functions, or third party programs. DockoMatic is\na free comprehensive molecular docking software program for all levels of scientists in both research and education.",
