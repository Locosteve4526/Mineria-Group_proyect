        "Description/Abstract": "Thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF) is a useful technique for  separating complex polymer mixtures. The unique features of ThFFF make  it applicable to many polymers that are difficult to characterized by  conventional methods. Advances in channel design, spearheaded by work at  the University of Utah's Field-Flow Fractionation Research Center, have  recently culminated in the introduction of a commercially available  instrument. Motivated by this progress, ThFFF is reviewed in this paper  with an emphasis on implementation. Theories governing retention, zone  dispersion and optimization are summarized. Procedures for obtaining  accurate molecular-weight distributions on polymers are reviewed along  with sample handling techniques. Also discussed is the application of  ThFFF to studies of thermal diffusion in polymer solutions. The paper  concludes with a discussion of current trends in the field.",
