        "Description/Abstract": "Failure has become an acceptable, even celebrated, part of innovation, education, and personal growth, a sign of resilience-as long as the person bounces back in a quick and efficient way. As long as they fail, fast, forward. The popular rhetoric around failure lifts the taboo by reframing failure as a ubiquitous experience and learnable skill. The consequence of this rhetorical trend, however, is that the failure stigma is not lifted but postponed. While failure rhetoric flourishes, the threat of becoming a failure looms more heavily and with an intensified sense of personal responsibility, due to the underlying message that the true failures fail at failing. By developing responses that are analytical and reflective, and by turning a critical eye toward the rhetorical construction of the failure stories that are shared publicly, we can explore ways to better understand and voice the unspeakable failures.",
