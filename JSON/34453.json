        "Description/Abstract": "Many Americans today have accepted what seemed inconceivable just a generation ago: that gender is artificial, is socially constructed, and can to be chosen freely by all individuals. This notion\u2014that biological sex can be willfully separated from gender\u2014originated in the arguments of influential radical feminists writing from the 1950s through the 1970s. The premises of their theories, in turn, have ushered in the new world of transgenderism. Yesterday\u2019s shocking theory has become today\u2019s accepted norm, with more changes to come. Yet whether this new world will prove to be fit for human flourishing remains to be seen.",
