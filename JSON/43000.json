        "Description/Abstract": "Reformation-era religious divisions complicated the traditional boundaries of parental authority. This was true for parents of adolescents and even of adult children. When parents and children agreed on religious matters, there were few insurmountable difficulties. When disputes arose, however, both parents and children wanted to save one another\u2019s souls and were often willing to ignore customary family and gendered hierarchies to attain this higher goal. This paper explores such issues in the British Isles after Henry VIII\u2019s break from Rome in 1534. Some parents abdicated their customary authority, humbling or subordinating themselves before their progeny to sway their children\u2019s religious loyalties. Children who appeared to have the best of intentions superseded their parents\u2019 hierarchical authority by taking responsibility for their parents\u2019 salvation as well as their own. As mutually altruistic as such desires initially appear, they caused no end of familial, gendered, and religious conflict. The Catholic Church, Protestant state churches in the British Isles, and the monarchy sometimes stepped between parents and children, trying to secure religious allegiances and social conformity. Although religious and salvific priorities justified each side\u2019s actions, such efforts unintentionally re-negotiated the bounds of authority between parents and children over the long-term. Both male and female adolescent and adult children emerged more greatly empowered and willing to make their own religious decisions than ever before. Parental authority\u2014particularly paternal authority\u2014over religious choices declined, as did the power of institutional churches and governments to enforce religious obedience and conformity.\n",
