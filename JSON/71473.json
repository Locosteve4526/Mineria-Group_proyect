        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;The emergence of increased technology and global competition in certain rapidly evolving marketplaces has transformed strategic marketing.\u00a0 These changes have made it harder for firms to obtain and retain a lasting competitive advantage useful for &lt;/span&gt;increasing brand's awareness and overall sales. This changed market structure in some products due to rapid technological change and increasing competition and intensity of competition characterizes what is defined as hypercompetitive markets.\u00a0 Using Data Envelopment Analysis this article contributes to an analysis of what Dagnino et al (2020) refer to as action based temporary competitive advantage analysis.",
