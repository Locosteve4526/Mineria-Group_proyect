        "Description/Abstract": "Recent statistics report three million people, or one percent of the population in the United States (U.S.), are affected by celiac disease (CD). Additionally in the U.S., one in one hundred children are affected with CD (Tully, 2008). Celiac disease, also known as gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a lifelong autoimmune disease that damages the small intestinal villous epithelium when there is ingestion of gluten and if left untreated can cause significant morbidity and mortality (Corrao, Corazza, Bagnardi, et al., 2001; Hill et al., 2004; Pietzak &amp; Thomas, 2003). Irritability, diarrhea, and stomach aches are common manifestations of viruses that affect children and often, parents believe their child has acquired a common cold or flu virus. The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence regarding incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of a child with CD.",
