        "Description/Abstract": "What happens when a detective confuses following with being the object of his search? As the narrative of Laetitia Masson's 1998 film, \u0154 vendre, drifts from private investigator Luigi Primo's search for France Robert, a runaway bride, to his own sordid relationships with women, traditions of narrative continuity and authority are violated. In offering a necessarily new take on the adage &quot;violence breeds violence,&quot; this article examines the extent to which Luigi's violent disposition, as he searches for France within the narrative, is ultimately expressed as violence to the narrative itself.",
