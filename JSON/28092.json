        "Description/Abstract": "For quite long time knitting, crocheting and lace viewed as the trite hobby of grandmothers. Nowadays, they have evolved into a highly versatile contemporary art form. Moreover, if someone goes back to art history in the early 20th century the Arts and Crafts movement asserted the handmade pieces as artworks considered equal as painting and sculpture, an argument that has continued until now. It\u2019s time then for an exhibition featuring the contemporaneity of craft.",
