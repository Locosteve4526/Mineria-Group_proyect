        "Description/Abstract": "Modern democracies are founded on the distinction between the private and the public. Civil governments still depend on the decisions of private individuals in families for their very survival, just as individuals depend on government to provide protection and a framework of rights within which to exercise their freedom.  Ultimately, the health of a political community grounded on the distinction between private and public depends on the people acting individually and not on the government.  ",
