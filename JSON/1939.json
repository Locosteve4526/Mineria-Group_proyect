        "Description/Abstract": "The authors examine the competing pressures on the education community  posed by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) and its mandates, and the  less specific, but visible demands that an increasingly global economy  place upon education planners, policy makers and researchers.  This  conflict is examined from a national, regional and local perspective,  with examples and citations from the recent literature and interview  quotations from Idaho teachers.  The authors also point to some specific  issues regarding the research methods mandated by the NCLBA, and the  problems these mandates may create in the education policy and research  communities.",
