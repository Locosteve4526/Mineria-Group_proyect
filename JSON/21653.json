        "Description/Abstract": "Land use change for bioenergy production can create substantial green house gas emissions through removal of standing vegetation and disturbance of soil carbon pools. With this project we assess: (1) whether shifting C3-dominated nonnative perennial grasslands to C4-dominated native perennial grasslands repay the carbon debt of land-use change by increasing soil carbon sequestration within the early years of establishment; (2) whether increased variation in root traits in species and cultivar mixes of native perennial grasses will enhance biomass production, soil carbon storage and the efficiency of nitrogen (N) cycling (i.e., decrease N losses); and (3) whether energy gain resulting from an increase in soil carbon storage and yield, along with a decrease in nutrient inputs and losses in low-input diverse mixtures of perennial grasses, is sufficient to offset energy gain from relatively greater biomass production in high input monocultures of perennial grasses. \nRole:  Principal",
