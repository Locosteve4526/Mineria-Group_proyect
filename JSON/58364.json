        "Description/Abstract": "Systems, methods, and compositions are disclosed for a Li-substituted layered-tunneled O3/spinel Na(NixFeyMnz)O2 cathode material, Na0.87Li0.25Ni0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2+\u2202 (LS-NFM) for enhanced sodium ion storage and cycling stability. The LS-NFM electrode is prepared by adjusting the stoichiometric ratio of the Na ion over the sum of Li and transition metal ions below 1. The Rietveld refinement of XRD data indicates that the cathode is composed of 94% layered and 6% spinel components. When cycled at a high current density of 100 mA g\u22121, LS-NFM cathode exhibited a first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 88% and reversible discharge capacity of 107 mAh g\u22121 after 50 cycles with the capacity retention of 95%.",
