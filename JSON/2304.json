        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of the reported study was to identify the degree to which college algebra students' value mathematical skills in their prospective careers. A survey was administered to N=144 students in six college algebra classes at a mid-sized doctoral granting university. Students in half the classes completed a data analysis project and half of the students planned to major in a business related degree. Logistic regression suggested students held mostly positive attitudes about the value of mathematics in their career, with business students expressing more positive attitudes than non-business students. Unexpectedly, those who completed the data analysis project expressed less positive attitudes on 6 of the 20 survey items.",
