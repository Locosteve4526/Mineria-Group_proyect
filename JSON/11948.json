        "Description/Abstract": "Interactive storytelling is an innovative way to present information in a manner that involves learners by allowing them to connect with the content. Incorporating interactive storytelling into online education offers the potential to increase student engagement and knowledge retention. This paper identifies and explains the five features of interactive storytelling: dynamic presentation, data visualization, multisensory media, interactivity and narration. Each feature is defined and its educational benefit is discussed. In addition, three examples are presented to showcase interactive storytelling and illustrate the use of these features. Suggestions for course designers and educators to incorporate interactive storytelling into online learning are provided, and challenges of this format are discussed.",
