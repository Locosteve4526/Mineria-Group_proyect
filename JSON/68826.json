        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Cobalt\u2019s importance has taken the rural community of Salmon in central Idaho by storm. Salmon was founded after gold was struck in the nearby mountains, and has seen its fair share of mining boom-and-bust cycles. The recent activity surrounding cobalt mining is routine for this community, yet the social landscape for mining has changed. Mines now face a wide range of environmental and social considerations that add time and cost to operations, while demand increases for critical minerals to advance our technological society. It is a dilemma that takes on an unaccustomed cast when the minerals are those that support a more environmentally sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These transitions present a series of juxtapositions. Cobalt mining can be environmentally destructive, yet this has to be weighed against the overall good it can do for the environment. Incoming residents looking to be closer to nature place new pressures on infrastructure and the community bonds of rural towns, but then add to the economic and cultural diversity that can help a rural community adapt to a changing world. Such juxtaposition is a reality we must face as we navigate the environmental and social changes that occur as we move toward a more environmentally sustainable future. The story of Salmon is a story of challenges and optimism that mining and social transitions can be done responsibly through the social, environmental, and economic boom-and-busts of the American West.&lt;/p&gt;",
