        "Description/Abstract": "This chapter covers several aspects of Canadian environmental policy.  We examine constitutional features such as the internal federal-provincial relationship regarding the environment and the dominance of the provincial policy.  The relationship between Canada and the United States also merits consideration.  The dominance of the United States in its advocacy in environmental protection and Canada\u2019s supportive role and eventual adjustment to the policy priorities of the United States is emphasized.  We then focus on the domestic environmental policy-making process and public opinion about the importance of the environment in relation to other public policy concerns.  Then we highlight the influential international role that Canada has played in creating and supporting multinational environmental agreements.  Finally, we provide some future perspective on environmental policy-making in Canada.",
