        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Many stakeholders now consider LGBTQ diversity and inclusion efforts as ethical and human rights promoting behavior for businesses to address social inequality. Historically, agency theory has dominated governance perspectives about management\u2019s motivations and behaviors, focusing on controlling management to mitigate myopic behavior. However, recent research as started to examine what factors play a role in promoting stewardship behaviors in managers. This paper examines the association of CEO compensation packages, the percent of women on the board, age diversity of the board, and CEO characteristics with stewardship behaviors that are more pro-social in nature. We examine how a stewardship governance paradigm with its more long-term outlook is manifested in firms\u2019 diversity and inclusion efforts. Our model demonstrates that boards with a higher percentage of women, longer CEO compensation, younger CEOs, and age diverse boards each increase the likelihood of an organization embracing diversity and inclusion policies.&lt;/p&gt;",
