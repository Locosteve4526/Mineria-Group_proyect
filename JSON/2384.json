        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract: The concept of civility in nursing education is analyzed using a modifcation of Wilson's\nclassic concept analysis procedure described by Walker and Avant. This analysis provides a common\nunderstanding ofthe concept ofthe civility in nursing education and is an attempt to more precisely\nclarify its meaning. Civility is integral to establishing meaningful relationships among students, faculty,\nand administrators and is a growing area of research in nursing education. Because the concept\nof civility lacks consistent definition, this article provides an operational definition of civility using\nrelevant sources from a variety of discipline",
