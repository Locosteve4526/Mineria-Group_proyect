        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Health disparities exist across socioeconomic status levels, yet empirical evidence between financial well-being (FWB) and health are limited.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;This cross-sectional study combined data from 25\u2009370 adults aged \u226518 years in the 2019 National Health Interview Survey with estimated household FWB scores from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s 2016 National Financial Well-being Survey. FWB associations with health service visits, biometric screenings, smoking status, body mass index and physical and mental conditions were tested using age-adjusted, sex-adjusted and health insurance coverage-adjusted linear regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;In 2019, the mean FWB for US adults was 56.1 (range 14 (worse) to 95 (best)). With increasing time since the last health service visit or screening, FWB was increasingly lower compared with adults with visits or screenings &lt;1 year (\u226510 years or \u2018never\u2019, FWB ranged from \u22121 (blood sugar check) to \u22126.5 (dental examination/cleaning) points). FWB was lower with declining general health status (excellent (reference), very good (\u22120.5 points), good (\u22123.4 points) and fair/poor (\u22126.6 points)). Adults with physical health conditions had FWB lower than adults without (range \u22120.4 (high cholesterol) to \u22124.6 (disability) points). FWB were lower in adults who have ever been diagnosed with anxiety disorder (\u22121.8 points) or depression (\u22122 points). Adults managing their anxiety or depression (no/minimal symptoms currently) had greater FWB (anxiety: 3 points and depression: 4.1 points) than those with symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Given the observed associations between FWB and health-related measures, it is crucial to consider FWB in primary and secondary health prevention efforts, recognising the relationship between economics, health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;",
