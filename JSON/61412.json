        "Description/Abstract": "Sustainable strategies applied in the context of supply chain management are receiving increasing\nattention from practitioners and researchers. In this regard, innovation in products, organizational\nstructures, and business methods can be the key to achieving economic, social, and environmental\noutcomes. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how sustainable-oriented innovations (SOI) can influence inter-organizational relationships in sustainable supply chain management. The research is based\non two case studies of Brazilian focal companies (Braskem and Mercur) and their respective suppliers\nand customers. We have identified different realities regarding operational aspects, supply chain\nstructure, and the strategic orientation for sustainability. The cases outlined provide in-depth insights\ninto the forms of SOI, i.e. product and organizational innovations. A practical implication includes the\nillustration of how the sustainability innovations allow the reaping of positive effects to businesses along\nthe supply chain. Collaborative relationships with suppliers and buyers can be seen as a source of\nlearning, development of new technology processes, and information acquisition. We position our\nresearch within the realm of sustainable SCM as a contribution to the increasingly discussed relationship\ndimensions and present links to the sustainable innovation literature, which is rarely amalgamated with\nthe SCM discipline. This establishes a more concrete connection, where further research at this intersection would be required.",
