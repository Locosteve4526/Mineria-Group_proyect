        "Description/Abstract": "This article examines the potential of harvesting and processing sturgeon and assesses its potential nutritional or dietary value as a food resource. Using examples from the Middle Snake River and other areas, catch ratios, handling time, and caloric values are calculated. Analysis of existing data suggests that while sturgeon were utilized, they may not have been optimal in the aboriginal diet.",
