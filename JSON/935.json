        "Description/Abstract": "Making students revisit their worldviews through an encounter with discomforting ideas is a valuable teaching and learning device. We administered an exercise in our &quot;Democracies, Diplomatic Relations, and Global Business&quot; upper division course that documents the reactions of our students to different worldviews. We found that students were more accepting of the provocative propositions in the post-instruction exercise given at the end of the course than in the pre-instruction exercise administered at the beginning of the course. We conclude that exposure to different worldviews, a fundamental activity of international studies courses, expands students' perceptual horizons and their cognitive and affective awareness.",
