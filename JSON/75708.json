        "Description/Abstract": "*This work is in progress. I have been working on the manuscript in Fall 2024.\u00a0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Planar functions themselves cannot be bijections, and&lt;br&gt;there are known lower and upper bounds established on $V(f)$ for planar functions.&lt;br&gt;Since the planarity of a function (in the sense just defined) is invariant&lt;br&gt;under the addition of linear transformations and constants, this means that&lt;br&gt;for any planar function $f$ we actually have&lt;br&gt;$$\\frac{q+1}{2}\\le V(f+L) \\le q - \\frac{2(q-1)}{1+\\sqrt{4q-3}}$$&lt;br&gt;for any linear transformation $L$. The lower bound was established independently by Kyureghyan and Pott \\cite{kyureghyan08}, and Qiu, Weng, Wang and Xiang \\cite{qiu07}, and later shown to be true for a much larger class of functions by Coulter and Matthews \\cite{coulter11}. The upper bound was proved in \\cite{coulter14c} by Coulter and Senger. &lt;br&gt;As an initial attempt to understand this phenomenon, we completely determine&lt;br&gt;the preimage distribution of&lt;br&gt;$x^2+L(x)$ for linear transformations over fields of order $p^2$, where $p$ is an odd prime.",
