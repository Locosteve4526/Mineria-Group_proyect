        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Affluent places are distinguished not only by who lives there and who does not, but by their distinct aesthetics and the policies and practices that support these. As we detail in this essay, elite placemaking became widespread with the grand estates and rural retreats of elite classes in Europe and the US and gathered strength with the emergence of suburbs and other enclaves beyond city centers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This practice of remove and restriction continues today and has taken new forms in rural areas that were once sites of agricultural or extractive production. Elite placemaking has also taken new forms within cities, as urban and gentrifying neighborhoods afford prestige once primarily associated with bucolic retreats. Again, the entrenchment of elites within these places brings with it visual signs of their power and preferences and generates patterns of exclusion. While the ability of elite groups to make and remake places reflects their economic, social and political power, we conclude by considering challenges to the exercise of power from both within elite groups and beyond.&lt;/span&gt;",
