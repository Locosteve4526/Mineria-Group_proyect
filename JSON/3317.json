        "Description/Abstract": "This article focuses on the role of cannibalism, both within the context of Schwab's 1991 play and as a reflection of modern Austrian society. Performativity, anthropological studies of cannibalism, and Artaud's theater of cruelty provide the framework for my analysis. Language and corporeality, both intrinsically connected to performativity and cruelty, emerge as crucial elements of Schwab's theatrical dissolution of boundaries.\n\n",
