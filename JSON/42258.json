        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Offshore wind development is in its nascent stages in the United States. Recent research indicates that the visual impacts of offshore\u00a0&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/wind-turbine&quot; title=&quot;Learn more about wind farms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages&quot;&gt;wind farms&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0are viewed negatively by the general population. This North Carolina application is the first US-focused discrete choice experiment that explicitly asks respondents to consider the positive local and global benefits from offshore wind development, such as job creation and\u00a0&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/greenhouse-gas-emission&quot; title=&quot;Learn more about greenhouse gas emission from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages&quot;&gt;greenhouse gas emission&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0reductions, simultaneously with their visual impacts. We find significant\u00a0&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/willingness-to-pay&quot; title=&quot;Learn more about willingness to pay from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages&quot;&gt;willingness to pay&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(WTP) for reducing the visual impacts of offshore\u00a0&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/wind-turbine&quot; title=&quot;Learn more about wind farms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages&quot;&gt;wind farms&lt;/a&gt;, and that the extent of disamenity varies in the population and with placement along developed tourist towns (as much as $783/year for three years) or preserved coastlines (as much as $451/year for three years). We also find that some preference classes value projects that create permanent jobs and reduce\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/carbon-dioxide-emission&quot; title=&quot;Learn more about carbon emissions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages&quot;&gt;carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We use our estimates of preferences for the positive and negative attributes to explore specific wind farm configurations and locations that could achieve positive consensus in a heterogenous population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
