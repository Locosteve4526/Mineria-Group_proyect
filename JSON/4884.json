        "Description/Abstract": "A developmental description of overarm-throwing characteristics of  U-14 female ASA softball players is presented here. Comparisons were made  between these athletes and teens of similar age in the United States  (Runion, Roberton, &amp; Langendorfe 2003) and in Germany (Ehl,  Roberton, &amp; Langendorfer, 2005). A majority of the softball players  demonstrated the most advanced developmental levels for the backswing  foot, humerus, and forearm components. Seventy percent (n = 26)  demonstrated a Level 2 trunk, while 30% (n = 11) demonstrated a  differentiated trunk, Level 3. The average throwing velocity was 62.58  ft/s (19.07 m/s). Comparisons were made to girls with less throwing  experience in the United States (Runion et al.) and Germany (Ehl et  al.); the softball players threw with greater velocity (9.12ft/s [2.77  m/s]and 15.89 ft/s [4.84 m/s], respectively) and demonstrated superior  trunk, humerus, and forearm actions. The boys from both countries threw  the ball faster than the softball players. Significant chi-square  analyses found the softball players had superior humeral actions (Level  3) compared to the German boys and superior forearm actions (Level 3)  compared to both groups of boys. Experience seems to have an impact when  comparisons among girls are made; yet, explanations for differences  seen between boys and girls still remain unclear and warrant further  research.",
