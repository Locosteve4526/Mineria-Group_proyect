        "Description/Abstract": "Methods are presented for in situ determination of Pb/U, Pb/Th, and Pb/Pb ages in monazite by laser ablation, single-collector, magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Analytical precisions for individual spot analyses are \u00b12\u20133% for 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U, 4% for 208Pb/232Th, and 1\u20132% for 207Pb/206Pb (2?, SD). For pooled analyses these precisions are ? \u00b1 1\u20132% for 206Pb/238U, 207Pb/235U, and 208Pb/232Th and ?1% for 207Pb/206Pb (2?, SE). When normalized to Trebilcock, LA-ICP-MS ages on other monazite standards can deviate from their thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) ages by up to 1% for 207Pb/206Pb and up to 5% for 206Pb/238U, 207Pb/235U, and 208Pb/232Th ages. This variability has also been observed for secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) Th-Pb dating. The source(s) of these inaccuracies remains unknown. Although there are significant uncertainties inherent in this technique, U-Th-Pb monazite dating by LA-ICP-MS has important applications where this higher level of uncertainty is acceptable. Application to a large vein monazite from the Llallagua tin district of Bolivia suggests mineralization at 17\u201321 Ma, consistent with 21 Ma K-Ar ages from wallrock minerals but distinct from ?45 Ma ages from apatite (Sm/Nd) and zircon (Pb/Pb).",
