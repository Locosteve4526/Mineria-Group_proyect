        "Description/Abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, result from the degradation of the central nervous system, particularly in the functionality of cholinergic and dopaminergic systems. The \u03b13\u03b22-nAChR isoform is a model receptor system for the \u03b16\u03b14\u03b22\u03b23-nAChR isoform shown to degrade in Parkinson\u2019s patients. It has been previously reported that binding of ligand agonists to the \u03b13\u03b22-nAChR isoform, such as nicotine, trigger the biological response of neuronal receptor up-regulation and reduction of proteasomal subunit degradation. In order to identify ligands that induce a favorable biological response, this study investigates the relative binding energies of three \u03b1-conotoxins (\u03b1-CTxs): native \u03b1-CTx MII, and two mutant variants, MII[E11A] and MII[N5R:E11A:H12K]. Two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was used to determined IC50 values for \u03b1-CTx MII and mutants. The IC50 values were 0.425, 0.996, and 7.75 nM for \u03b1-CTx MII, MII[E11A], and MII[N5R:E11A:H12K], respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to these systems to explore the energetics and dynamics of \u03b1-CTx interaction with nAChRs. The MII[N5R:E11A:H12K] mutant had a relative binding free energy (\u2206\u2206Gbind) of -7.29 kcal mol-1 compared to the relative binding free energy of MII[E11A]  which was 1.93 kcal mol-1. Despite the greater predicted binding affinity for the MII[N5R:E11A:H12K] mutant, TEV experiments showed that this ligand only induced approximately 60% blockage of \u03b13\u03b22-nAChR.",
