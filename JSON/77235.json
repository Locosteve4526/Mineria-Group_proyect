        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;As public higher education continues to see shrinking state and federal support, universities have responded with budget cuts, program prioritization, and other measures. At our institution, our English Department was divided into smaller programs, which required us to not only pivot our technical communication degree offerings but to manage a unit with fewer resources. Despite these challenges, we revised our writing degree in an effort to respond to student needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;In this presentation, I will share these revisions that accounted for resource constraints. Our goal was to revise our degree now that we were a standalone writing studies department; that context came with opportunities but also significant challenges. It is these opportunities and challenges I will share. Opportunities include what is possible when a degree program can focus solely on writing\u2013when we no longer have to adhere to the traditions of English literature programs, we were freed to focus our program more specifically on writing, including technical and professional writing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;However, this work also exposed us to challenges and risks: we had to adapt our course offerings to account for the constraints brought on by increased service course demands, shrinking faculty availability, and fewer resources. These challenges are what I\u2019ll explore to discuss how we are attempting to face them. I will close by inviting the audience to share how their own programs have addressed the challenges they face and what this means for the next steps in program and curriculum development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
