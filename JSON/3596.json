        "Description/Abstract": "In a response-to-intervention framework, schools typically employ a  direct route approach to screening, in which students                      identified as at risk by a screening process are  directly placed into intervention. Direct route approaches require  screening                      decisions to be highly accurate, but few studies  examining the predictive validity of reading measures report achieving  recommendations                      for classification accuracy. In this study, two  approaches to improving the classification accuracy of predictors of  Grade                      3 reading performance are compared. Findings  indicate that the reliance on single screening measures do not result in  high                      levels of classification accuracy. Classification  accuracy improved by 2% when a combination of measures was employed and                      by 6% when a predicted probability risk index was  used. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",
