        "Description/Abstract": "My consideration of this second edition of Turning Point is framed through my perspective as a user of the text.  I not only study this book with graduate students in curriculum and instruction but also re-consider the text from multiple viewpoints in my quest for emphasizing democratic education and curriculum work.  During a local school superintendent's recent presentation in one my my graduate level &quot;Issues in Education&quot; courses, she shared the what of curriculum is no longer within the purview of teachers.  Teachers, in her perspective, should only have control over the how of the curriculum.  From her vantage point, how should teacher educators and curriculum workers cultivate colleagues who uphold the ideals of democratic education and more particularly democratic participation within policy and curriculum work?",
