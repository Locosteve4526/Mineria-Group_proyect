        "Description/Abstract": "Antibacterial resistance has increased in recent years leading to higher prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Quorum-sensing allows bacteria to communicate using small molecules called autoinducers which respond to a potential threat like antibiotic attack by forming biofilms, secreting virulence factors and rapidly sharing resistance genes. The 3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone autoinducer, synthesized by LasI AHL Synthase, has been shown to initiate interbacterial communication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during the early stages of quorum-sensing. The inherent difficulty in the synthesis of acyl-ACP substrate impedes mechanistic studies and inhibitor design for the LasI enzyme. In order to circumvent this problem, we have explored the activities of C-2 dimethyl analogs of acyl-ACP, acyl-CoA and acyl-Pantetheine as potential acyl-ACP surrogate substrates for this enzyme. The substrate analogs were synthesized by coupling activated carboxylic acids with their corresponding thiols. The kcat and Km of these substrate analogs with the LasI enzyme will be determined using colorimetry.",
