        "Description/Abstract": "Instructors accustomed to teaching in a traditional format are increasingly involved in online course design. This task involves adjusting to a new format, developing online courses, adjusting to and learning new technology, and determining best practices. This paper discusses the importance of technology and pedagogy in online course design. A literature review was performed to investigate the different supports available to teachers designing online courses, with a specific focus of determining methods that are used to help teachers design online courses. These methods include offering online training classes, resources and software to teachers and providing expert assistance. In some cases, teams are utilized to help online teachers learn and collaborate with others. Institutions have also offered templates and guidance to support teachers with online course design. Focusing on the importance of course design as a way to increase learning and course quality is a way to increase the effectiveness of online courses. ",
