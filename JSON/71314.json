        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Public engagement is becoming a critical element of US universities\u2019 missions. Defining public engagement has become increasingly complex, however, and navigating the significant and diverse literature on public engagement can be daunting. This paper addresses this challenge as well as two others that make public engagement difficult for those feeling called (or pressured) to do such work. We draw on our own public engagement experience and research to 1) conceptually scope out the terrain of public engagement literature and approaches, 2) articulate how the emerging problems of rapid intensification and hyper-polarization in American political culture make public engagement work evermore challenging for both faculty and students, and 3) call attention to the ways in which universities are often not bureaucratically or structurally aligned to meaningfully support and advance public engagement work. We conclude with some recommendations for how faculty, staff, and administrators might navigate these concerns.&lt;/span&gt;",
