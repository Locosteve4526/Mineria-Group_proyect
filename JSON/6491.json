        "Description/Abstract": "As a participant in SEG's Geoscientists Without Borders program, we have developed a geophysics field camp in northern Thailand to train students and professionals from throughout Southeast Asia in field-based geophysical methods. Over the past two years, faculty, technicians, professionals, and students from 18 institutions and 11 countries have acquired, processed, and interpreted geophysical data at field sites in and around Chiang Mai, Thailand. Participation from undergraduate students, graduate students, and private and public sector geoscience professionals provides a broad base of experience, background, and insight. Our training has provided opportunities for cross-cultural collaboration and education, and a greater use of field-based geophysical methods for academic, private sector, and government agencies throughout Southeast Asia.",
