        "Description/Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our usual research practices. Of necessity, we quickly transitioned our research practices from in-person to virtual. In this paper, we describe our research practices before the global pandemic and how we transitioned our participatory research with children to virtual design sessions. We also present what went well and not so well during our virtual design sessions. Additionally, we present some questions that look to the future of working with children as design partners. Finally, this paper could help inform other child-computer interaction researchers as they conduct online design sessions with children.",
