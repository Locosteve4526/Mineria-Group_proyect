        "Description/Abstract": "We examine the impact of low\u2010priority initiatives on criminal activity. Low\u2010priority initiatives mandate that minor marijuana possession offenses be the lowest enforcement priority for police. Localities pass these laws because they believe if officers devote fewer resources toward minor marijuana crimes, more resources will be available to deter more serious crimes. Using data from California, we find that jurisdictions that adopted low\u2010priority laws experienced a reduction in arrests for misdemeanor marijuana offenses. However, we do not find evidence of a consistent effect of enacting a low\u2010priority initiative on the crime or clearance rate of other felonies. (JEL H1, H4, K4)",
