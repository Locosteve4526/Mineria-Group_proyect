        "Description/Abstract": "From \u201cNo Name Woman\u201d to Gu Liu Xin: \nGhost Writing in Amy Tan\u2019s The Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter\n\nIn the epilogue to The Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter, Amy Tan offers a scene that combines the adult writer, Ruth Young, at her desk developing a story with the writer\u2019s childhood memory of writing messages from a ghost on a tea-tray lined with sand. By fusing the two in one scene, Tan provides an apt metaphor for the work she performs throughout her fiction, that of investigating and reclaiming aspects of the past in order to define the self, align it with female ancestors, and orient it toward the future. The image of the daughter at the tea-tray writing out messages from the dead symbolizes the \u201cpossession\u201d of the daughter by her ghostly female ancestor. This possession is not a passive state but an active one, for the daughter exercises her agency as a writer by using her imagination and responding through her written words to the to her mother about Precious Auntie.\nMoreover, the story of Precious Auntie in The Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter may be interpreted as a creative adaptation of \u201cNo Name Woman,\u201d the first chapter of Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s The Woman Warrior. Tan borrows the topos of the patriarchal silencing of women from Kingston as well as the imagery of paper and ink to recover the silenced female ancestor.\nIn The Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter, the fact that the family manufactures ink is a critical feature of LiLing\u2019s childhood experience and her relationship with Precious Auntie.  Given that ink is the means by which Precious Auntie tries to kill herself (the first time) and instead injures and disfigures herself, it is also a primary element in the plot of Precious Auntie\u2019s life story. LiLing\u2019s calligraphy and Ruth\u2019s own work as a writer are part of the family of images relating to writing in the novel. \nThese images provide a strong parallel to the writing metaphors in \u201cNo Name Woman\u201d and \u201cWhite Tigers,\u201d the first two chapters of Kingston\u2019s Woman Warrior.  In \u201cNo Name Woman,\u201d Kingston figures her memoir about her anonymous aunt as a tribute or homage, taking the place of origami offerings to the dead. In \u201cWhite Tigers,\u201d Kingston portrays the long section in which Maxine \u201cbecomes\u201d Fa Mu Lan as an imaginative entering into an ink drawing, a passage that focuses on the similarity between the image of a bird in flight with that of the Chinese ideograph for \u201chuman.\u201d This image symbolizes Kingston\u2019s active engagement with the tale of Fa Mu Lan in her work as a writer.  In turn, Tan\u2019s adaptation and revision of Kingston\u2019s anonymous aunt in The Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter similarly foregrounds images of writing. Tan does so in order to transfigure the anonymous aunt, a deliberately forgotten female ancestor, into a mother with a name and life story.\n\nJeff Westover (jeffreywestover@boisestate.edu)\n182 E Gettysburg St., Boise, ID 83706     \n208.598.6566\n",
