        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The route by which a vaccine is delivered can determine its efficacy. Transcutaneous delivery for subunit vaccines is highly advantageous but requires the use of an adjuvant. The cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) is a well-described mucosal adjuvant that can also induce responses from cutaneous surfaces. In this study, we developed a sucrose, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) dissolvable microneedle patch loaded with a fluorescent CTA2/B fusion. The patch was tested to assess application force, stability of cargo, and penetration of skin. The microneedles were found to withstand application forces in a parafilm test model and penetrate to the predicted depth of the dermis. The fluorophore from the CTA2/B fusion was effectively delivered to the epidermis and dermis of porcine skin ex vivo. This study supports the use of sugar-based dissolvable microneedles for the delivery of CTB adjuvanted transcutaneous vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;",
