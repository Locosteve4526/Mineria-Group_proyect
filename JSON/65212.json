        "Description/Abstract": "Quantification of natural knee kinematics is essential for the assessment of joint function in the diagnosis of pathologies. Combined measurements of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint kinematics are necessary because knee pathologies, such as progression of osteoarthritis and patellar instability, are a frequent concern in both articulations. Combined measurement of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics also enables calculation of important quantities, specifically patellar tendon angle, which partly determines the loading vector at the tibiofemoral joint and patellar tendon moment arm. The goals of this research were to measure the differences in tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics, patellar tendon angle (PTA), and patellar tendon moment arm (PTMA) that occur during non-weight-bearing and weight-bearing activities in older adults.",
