        "Description/Abstract": "The accuracy of a binarization algorithm is often calculated\r\nrelative to a ground truth image. Except for synthetically\r\ngenerated images, no ground truth image exists.\r\nEvaluating binarization on real images is preferred. The\r\nground truthing between and among different operators is\r\ncompared. Four direct metrics were used. The variability\r\nof the results of five different automatic binarization algorithms\r\nwere compared to that of manual ground truth results.\r\nSignificant variability in the ground truth results was\r\nfound.",
