        "Description/Abstract": "Ten downward portions in the large oscillatory force-distance curve reported earlier are analyzed to understand a nanoscale water meniscus confined between a sharp probe and a flat substrate in air. The sigmoidal shape of each portion leads to assumption that the meniscus is made up of n independent transitions of two states, one for a coil state and the other for a bridge state, in each portion. The analysis reveals that each downward portion results from a coil-to-bridge transition of n self-assembled water chains whose length ranges between 197 and 383 chain units. The transition provides novel insights into water\u2019s unique properties such as the high surface tension and the long-range condensation distance.",
