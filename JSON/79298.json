        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wildfires have increasingly affected human and natural systems across the western United States (WUS) in recent decades. Given that the majority of ignitions are human-caused and potentially preventable, improving the ability to predict fire occurrence is critical for effective wildfire prevention and risk mitigation. Using over 500,000 wildfire ignition records from 2000 to 2020, we developed machine learning models to predict daily ignition probability across the WUS, incorporating a wide range of physical, biological, social, and administrative variables. A key innovation of this work lies in the development of novel sampling techniques for representing ignition absence. Unlike traditional purely random or hyper-sampling techniques\u2014which fail to account for autocorrelated processes in time (such as droughts, insect outbreaks, heatwaves) and in space (such as proximity to human settlements, infrastructure presence, fuel type)\u2014our approach introduces spatially and temporally stratified sampling of ignition absence. By drawing absence samples near the location and timing of historical ignitions, we better captured the complex environmental and anthropogenic conditions associated with fire occurrence or lack thereof. Models trained without stratified sampling produced ignition probability maps that consistently overestimated fire risk during high fire danger periods, whereas models incorporating stratified fire absence samples more accurately captured the spatial and temporal variability of fire potential and achieved predictive accuracies exceeding 95% across multiple metrics. In addition to operational utility for fire prevention and resource allocation, our approach offers insights into the drivers of wildfire ignitions, highlighting the importance of incorporating spatiotemporal structure in absence sampling for wildfire modeling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
