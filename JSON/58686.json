        "Description/Abstract": "In this chapter, we present a practical, introductory guide on the use of social network analysis to examine social structures (e.g., family and organization) in family business research. We present an overview of social networks coupled with a taxonomy of social ties. Then, we discuss the basics of designing social network research with a focus on data collection and management. We conclude with an overview of three software applications utilized to analyze social network data (i.e., UCINET, Stata, and R). Throughout we include examples and illustrations specific to family business research.",
