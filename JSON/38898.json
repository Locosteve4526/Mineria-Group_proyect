        "Description/Abstract": "Previous research presented the idea that teams comprised predominately of a\r\npersonality type such as that characteristic of system security professionals, potentially are at risk of thinking narrowly and unimaginatively when trying to forecast and prepare proactively for security threats. Research results to date have been mixed regarding the impact of personality diversity on team process and success. Four experimental teams were formed representing the personality type predominately found in system security professionals. Four control teams were formed as well comprised randomly of diverse personality types dissimilar from that of the security professionals. The results indicate\r\nthat personality diversity amongst the members of a problem-solving, idea-generating team does not lead to the generation of significantly more creative solutions or ideas as individuals or as a group. Additionally, the study seems to indicate that diversity of personality types amongst the team members does not improve the idea generating process nor lead to a greater sense of accomplishment for those in the group.
