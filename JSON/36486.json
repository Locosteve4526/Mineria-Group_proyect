        "Description/Abstract": "Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe is one of North America\u2019s most\r\nimperiled ecosystems, as the result of many factors including grazing, development,\r\nfire, and invasion of exotic plants. Threats to sagebrush steppe are expected to\r\nincrease because of climate change and further human development. Many songbirds\r\nuse sagebrush steppe opportunistically, but a few obligate species are dependent\r\non it. To quantify the habitat associations of three sagebrush obligates, the Sage\r\nThrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus), Sagebrush Sparrow (Artemisiospiza nevadensis),\r\nand Brewer\u2019s Sparrow (Spizella breweri), and nine other songbird species that\r\nuse this habitat, we surveyed across a broad region of Idaho. At each of 104 sites,\r\nwe selected three plots, one each in relatively poor, moderate, and good condition,\r\ndefined qualitatively by the cover of native shrubs. We quantified bird abundance by\r\npoint counts, described the habitat at these points by a line-intercept method, and\r\nat each plot calculated the fraction of a circle (radius 1 km) covered in shrubs or\r\ngrassland. We compared two-scale occupancy models based on these data by the\r\ninformation-theoretic approach. According to the models, our qualitative assessment\r\nof habitat condition within a site distinguished birds\u2019 use of relatively good habitat\r\nfrom their use of poor habitats only, not from those in moderate condition. Thus\r\nthe sagebrush-obligate species may tolerate some local habitat degradation, at least\r\nup to some unidentified threshold. Occurrence of all three sagebrush obligates correlated\r\nwell with one or more characteristics of sagebrush such as its cover, height, or\r\nheterogeneity in height. They differed in the Sage Thrasher being most sensitive to\r\nsagebrush cover, the Sagebrush Sparrow being found more often at lower elevations,\r\nand the Brewer\u2019s Sparrow being less sensitive to ground cover. The nine other species\r\nevaluated were less or negatively associated with attributes of sagebrush. On the basis\r\nof these results, we suggest that the three sagebrush obligates are best conserved by\r\npromoting shrublands over a broad range of elevations, containing both sagebrush\r\nand other shrubs in patches of mixed height, and minimizing invasive annual grasses.",
