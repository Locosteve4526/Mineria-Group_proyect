        "Description/Abstract": "Proteins from hyaline or articular cartilage can be isolated and purified using a series of chemical extraction steps and various identification techniques including mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. The isolation and purification of proteins from cartilage will facilitate the study of specific proteins and multimeric complexes of cartilage proteins to better understand their functions in normal healthy cartilage as well as pathological conditions of cartilage. Cartilage tissue engineering efforts rely on the comprehensive understanding of the composition of cartilage and the function of each of the protein constituents.",
