        "Description/Abstract": "Although theory points to the relevance of dynamic capabilities in firms that seek to drive new markets, we lack a clear understanding of how firms can develop and apply such capabilities. In this paper, we draw on a seven-step quasi-Delphi study to discuss how market-driving companies should conduct market-sensing, \u2212 seizing, and &lt;br&gt;-transforming activities. We identify important research gaps related to determining needs in market sensing, making \u201cbig bets\u201d versus taking small, incremental steps in market seizing, and individual versus collective market-driving activities in transforming markets, and on the role of agility and resources in market-driving activities. We propose an integrated research agenda to address these gaps and advance exploration of the &lt;br&gt;market-driving phenomenon.",
