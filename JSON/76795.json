        "Description/Abstract": "from the website: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Golden Satellite Debris&lt;/em&gt; is my 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; book. I don\u2019t feel particularly superstitious about that. I do still feel as if a book of mine coming into the world is still an unprecedented surprise. I feel a mix of hope and failure. The title points towards a sense of the wonder and glory of life on this planet, the Golden (with a hint of the sun setting no doubt), but also a sense of life as an aftermath, Debris, a sort of arbitrary and accidental outcome of equations and collisions only some of which we are aware of. I see the earth as a Satellite, a contingent object moving in space, but on a smaller scale also the human and the poem, spinning around some unknown centre, whether we call that truth, being, love or death.&quot; \u2014 Martin Corless-Smith",
