        "Description/Abstract": "Even the most rudimentary definitions of the term \u2018technology\u2019 indicate that its meaning extends far beyond artefacts and devices to include processes, methods, means and applied knowledge. It is therefore surprising how rarely instructional theories, methods and applications \u2013e.g., learning theories learning designs or learning environments ? are considered specifically as technologies in the relevant literature. This chapter focuses on the instrumental nature of the concept \u2018learning\u2019 and learning theory, which Gert Biesta and others have characterized as being manifest in a \u2018new language of learning.\u2019 This refers to a vocabulary or discourse that, for example, characterizes \u2018\u2018teaching\u2019 [as the] \u2018facilitation of learning\u2019 [and], \u2018education\u2019 [as the] \u2018provision of learning opportunities\u2019\u2019 (Haugsbak &amp; Nordkvelle, 2007,  p. 2). The paper argues that this vocabulary represents a particular technologization or instrumentalization of education, a process that makes educational practices and priorities appear germane to, or even incomplete without, technological rationalization and reshaping. This paper traces how this vocabulary casts learning as a natural and universal process, and quite consistently accompanies the promotion of a range of technological artifacts in education. Running from the introduction of \u2018teaching machines\u2019 through to current visions of school reform, this theoretical lexicon will be shown to efface its cultural and ideological contingency through a quasi?scientific \u2018neutrality\u2019 and a biologically?based universality, and to limit the possibility for educational discourse and practice.",
