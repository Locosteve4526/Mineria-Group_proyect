        "Description/Abstract": "Collegiate Summer Baseball Leagues offer development opportunities to\u00a0college players. Overall, a significant number of Major League Baseball players once\u00a0played in a summer league, suggesting at least some positive effect from the experience.\u00a0However, teams within each league are individually owned and likely approach both\u00a0business and baseball operations in different manners, leading to different opportunities\u00a0for players based on their team affiliation. This investigative and exploratory study\u00a0examines differences in player performance and from their collegiate season to their\u00a0following collegiate summer league season. Results suggest that some summer league\u00a0teams, such as the Savannah Bananas, have significant effects on individual player\u00a0performance compared to their collegiate teams. Qualitative interviews with Bananas\u2019\u00a0players are then conducted to add context and explanations for the quantitative results.\u00a0Interviews suggest that the team environment in which they play improved their\u00a0performance. Benefits to mindset, self-confidence, and goals to improve on and off the\u00a0field are cited as beneficial.",
