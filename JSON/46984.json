        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract: : This case study of librarian-led marketing efforts at a mid-size academic library examines workarounds to obstacles that librarians frequently encounter when taking on marketing for their libraries. These obstacles often stem from a combination of misunderstanding and/or misplaced priorities at both the unit and administrative levels. Challenges in this case study include a number of factors: no marketing strategy at the administrative level, a lack of understanding from colleagues generally, little time to complete tasks or improve marketing skills, and no dedicated funding. To address these challenges the authors embarked on an internal marketing campaign engaged extensively on social media networks and made creative use of additional freely available marketing tools. These efforts helped foster engagement with library personnel, services, resources, and space while building a brand image that aligns with the reality of what a modern academic library contributes to campus.",
