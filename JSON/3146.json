        "Description/Abstract": "We have modeled in vitro infection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in primary unstimulated cells of the porcine bone marrow and have studied the phenotypical cytophotometry. Monocytes and large-sized lymphocytes completely vanished in 72 h of infection which is result of high sensitivity of those cells to ASFV. We describe DNA synthesis in monocytes at 24 h post infection. Cytophotometry of the uninfected cells revealed the few number of atypical lymphocytes and lymphoblasts after 72 h of cultivation; whereas in viral infected cultures, atypical cells appeared in large quantity (about 14%) with 24 h. Most of atypical lymphocytes and lymphoblasts had altered nucleus, and only a small number of atypical cells had additional nucleus. The cytophotometry of main and additional nuclei showed that DNA content didn't exceed diploid standard which indicates that the additional nuclei were consequence of fragmentation of nuclei in lymphocytes.",
