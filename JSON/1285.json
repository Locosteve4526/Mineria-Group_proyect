        "Description/Abstract": "Interest in psychology at the undergraduate level continues to grow.  There have been over 70,000 bachelor's degrees awarded every year in psychology since 1994-1995 (National Center for Education  Statistics, 2002). In 1979-1980, 42,093 psychology bachelor's degrees  were awarded; just 20 years later, that number increased to 74,060,  representing a 43.2% increase. This growth is also reflected in the  interest in graduate programs of psychology. In the same 20-year time  frame, master's degree awards increased by 31.3% and doctorates awarded  increased by 21.2%. When growth at the undergraduate ranks accelerates  past the growth at the graduate level, this is bound to cause some  stress for undergraduate students intending to continue their education  in psychology.",
