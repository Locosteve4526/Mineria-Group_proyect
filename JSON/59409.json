        "Description/Abstract": "We describe a case of immune-allergic reaction in a 2-year-old female given a\nfull course of Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine (Sigma Tau\u2019s Eurartesim) dosed\nbased on weight at a tablet of 320/40mg per day for 3 days during a\nmass treatment campaign in Uganda. In the week following injestion, she\ndeveloped a progressive skin rash and blisters which later formed painful raw\nareas and was accompanied by a low grade fever. The child was not taking any\nprior medications. Blood work was performed (CBC, RFTs/LFTs) and found to be\nunremarkable apart from hypo-proteinemia of 4.63(6.6-8.7 g/dl).  Her\nconstellation of symptoms and presentation were consistent with Toxic Epidermal\nNecrolysis (&gt; 30% TBSA), or Steven-Johnson syndrome. Causality was established\nas \u2018probable\u2019 for Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine using both the Naranjo and the\nWorld Health Organization causality assessment scales. It could not be\nestablished if the causative agent was dihydroartemisinin or piperaquine,\nhowever, the child had previously taken artemether-lumefantrine for malaria\nwith no reported reactions or repercussions. The child was admitted to the\nburns unit and managed with supportive treatment including steroids,\nantihistamines, tetracycline ointment for eye care, prophylactic antibiotics,\nand meticulous twice daily dressing with neomycin cream. After a good clinical\nresponse, she was discharged after 2 weeks and subsequently monitored for 6\nmonths for the reappearance of lesions. Her recovery was found to be complete\nand the child and her caregivers were given a laminated card to be\nused at all health facilities, advising against any retreatment with\ndihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The aim of this work is to bring attention of\nthis case to clinicians and malaria control operations, and to provide and\ndiscuss the details of her successful therapy.",
