        "Description/Abstract": "The use of clickers in the classroom can improve student engagement and motivation.  However, few studies have been conducted on faculty opinions of the use of clickers.  This paper measures clicker use amongst legal studies in business faculty and investigates perceptions and factors associated with adoption of clickers in the discipline.  Survey results indicate that most legal studies in business faculty have either never or rarely use clickers, and very few faculty members in the discipline use clickers regularly.  Instructors perceive clickers to improve teaching, but may be reluctant to adopt them because of time constraints.  ",
