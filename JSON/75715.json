        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;While attention has long been a concern in western philosophy and eastern spirituality, technologies (e.g., social media, gaming) and pathologies (e.g., attention deficit disorders) have recently foregrounded the issue specifically in education. Issues of student absorption and diversion have been widely discussed; but comparatively less has been said about on teachers and their attending, particularly the kind of attention that the individuality of each of their students claims. This paper begins by reconstructing the kind of awareness and attention that are implied in Kant\u2019s account of logical tact and Herbart\u2019s lecture on specifically pedagogical tact. Potentially tactful forms of awareness are then explored and delineated in phenomenological, Gestaltist terms \u2013 as well as through reference to Freud\u2019s notion of \u2018free-floating attention.\u2019 The paper concludes by outlining characteristics of awareness that appear requisite to the demands of tactful decision and action, an attention at once receptive to the world outside yet also modulated by the one attending.&lt;/span&gt;",
