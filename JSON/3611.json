        "Description/Abstract": "Tiered models of service delivery for both academics and behavior are being increasingly adopted across the nation, and discussions of how to implement these models effectively and simultaneously are growing. In this article, the authors share some lessons learned from a 2-year implementation project to implement a comprehensive (both academic and behavior) model of tiered service delivery in an elementary school. The authors discuss four major issues that arose during implementation, including signs for predicting these challenges and insights into how they can be addressed.",
