        "Description/Abstract": "???Previous research reports positive effects of yoga on health. The  physical and psychological outcomes of participation in Bikram yoga are  under-researched despite its increasing popularity, and this type of  yoga may be significant with regards to stress management due to its  unique method of practice. This study was designed to assess changes in  levels of mindfulness, perceived stress, and physical fitness after  participation in an 8-week Bikram yoga program. Fifty-one participants  aged 20\u201354 years (mean, 31.57 years) were recruited by word of mouth  from a large university located in the Northwestern United States.  Participants attended a minimum of 20 Bikram sessions over 8 weeks.  Changes in mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), perceived  stress (Perceived Stress Scale), and physical fitness (resting heart  rate, 1-mile walk, sit-and-reach, total-body rotation, and single-leg  balance) were measured. Eight weeks of Bikram yoga improved mindfulness,  perceived stress, cardiorespiratory endurance, flexibility and balance (p &lt; 0.01). Mindfulness was negatively correlated with perceived stress (r=?0.43, p &lt; 0.01) and resting heart rate (r=?0.30, p &lt; 0.05). The results show that Bikram yoga positively affected  psychological and physical health in the sample population. This  information can be used to further the understanding of mind-body based  programs, and how Bikram yoga may give people the tools to decrease  perceived stress, potentially having an effect on chronic stress-related  illnesses.",
