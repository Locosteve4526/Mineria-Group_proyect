        "Description/Abstract": "Collections of black fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) larvae were made at  previously unexplored lotic habitats in northern Thailand and their gut  fungi identified. Eight trichomycete species were recovered, including  one new species, Harpella asiana, and two possible new species: Graminelloides cf. biconica and Harpella cf. tica. Paramoebidium sp., Pennella montana Lichtwardt, Stachylina nana Lichtwardt and Stipella vigilans L\u00e9ger &amp; Gauthier are new Thailand records. The widely distributed species of gut fungus, Harpella melusinae L\u00e9ger &amp; Duboscq, that has previously been reported from Thailand,  was also recovered. We have shown that trichomycetes are abundant in  northern Thailand and undoubtedly many other Harpellales, beyond the  taxa we report here, are present especially in unexplored regions of the  country and in different hosts, habitats and times of the year. These  findings correspond to 40 (6/15) of the trichomycete genera previously  reported from tropical regions worldwide.",
