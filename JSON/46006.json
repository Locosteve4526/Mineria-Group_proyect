        "Description/Abstract": "Students with math learning disabilities have been shown to experience math anxiety at rates nearly double those of students without. Anxiety about math is thought to disrupt learning by co-opting attentional resources that could go towards problem solving and may be caused by the way in which students interpret their math-related experiences. This article describes a math intervention designed through a framework of self-regulated learning that defines self-regulated learners as students who are connected, self-aware, self-determined, strategic and resilient. Specifically described in this article is an intervention that helps students regulate anxiety, initiate a problem-solving strategy, and advocate as needed to use approaches they find effective.",
