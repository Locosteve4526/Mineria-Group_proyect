        "Description/Abstract": "The article provides a guide for reading the lyric narrative experiments in Virginia Woolf's short story &quot;Moments of Being: Slater's Pins Have No Points,&quot; which is said to capture her fondness for Johannes Bach's fugue. It proposes a dialectic relationship of love between theme and content in the story. It examines two parallel structures in the narrative progression, and how the mimetic and synthetic dimensions work together to enlist readers in the lyric narrative.",
