        "Description/Abstract": "Pilot test projects often examine technical, operational, and economic feasibility of new systems. When inter-organizational systems are pilot-tested, it is helpful to also examine relational feasibility. We report on relational feasibility issues identified in two IOS pilot tests in the context of emergency medicine. Lessons learned and implications for using pilot tests to assess relational feasibility in health care and other domains are discussed.",
