        "Description/Abstract": "The view of online education as a disruptive force to more traditional forms of education is coming to fruition as blended and fully online methods of delivery move from early adoption to mainstream. This trend, along with the continued rapid advancement in technologies means our deeply held view of  \u201cthe classroom\u201d as one-size fits all is being challenged now, more than ever in the history of education, and will continue to be challenged more rapidly and in ways that we cannot foresee. This presentation provides a thought-provoking look at the intersecting paths of technological advancement with the evolution of our educational systems, the current landscape of online education, insights into where we might be headed, and practical solutions as we face the inevitable dynamic and personalized future of education.",
