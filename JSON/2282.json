        "Description/Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of adding individualized, function-based support to the well-documented early\nintervention, First Step to Success. A single-subject multiple-baseline design was applied across three, K-1 students\nwho did not respond to standard First Step to Success procedures. A functional behavioral assessment and\nindividualized function-based support plan was added to the First Step protocol. The multiple baseline analysis\ndocumented an effect between adding individualized, function-based supports to the standard First Step program and\nboth (a) a decrease in problem behavior and (b) an increase in academic engagement. Implications of the results are\nprovided for the design of school-based behavior support, implementation of First Step to Success, and applications\nof manualized interventions.",
