        "Description/Abstract": "When interacting with shareholders, female CEOs face challenges in meeting observers\u2019 expectations for them as both women and leaders.  To meet these expectations, we theorize that female CEOs communicate in a complex way that allows them to display both agentic (leadership role) and communal (female gender role) qualities by  suppressing elements of agency that conflict with gender role expectations, while exhibiting elements of agency that do not conflict with these expectations.  We find support for our arguments.  Our findings provide important insights into how female leaders cope with conflicting gender and leadership role expectations, and how their language differs from that of their male counterparts. Finally, results from a supplemental analysis suggest that the stock market values communication that incorporates both agentic and communal elements.",
