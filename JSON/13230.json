        "Description/Abstract": "Over the past century or more, the language associated with education and pedagogy has changed considerably. I sketch out an overview of these changes, focusing on the field of educational psychology, and beginning with the work of Dewey on the one hand, and Behaviourism on the other. I include the vocabulary of the \u2018Learning Sciences\u2019 which sees itself as being centrally informed by the neurosciences. I focus on the notion of \u2018the self\u2019 in educational psychology. The term Bildung is central to this psychology, particularly as it is articulated in Dewey\u2019s early textbook titled simply \u201cpsychology.\u201d Bildung has been variously translated as edification, formation or growth.",
