        "Description/Abstract": "This purpose of this paper is to report the development and validation of the Writing Dispositions Scale (WDS), a self-report instrument for measuring affective stances toward writing. Survey data from a sample of 854 elementary and middle school students were collected and randomly split to facilitate both an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The findings of the EFA demonstrated that an 11- item Writing Dispositions Scale has good internal and content reliability, and good discriminant validity. The CFA supports the item selection of the EFA, and demonstrates excellent factorial validity and reliability. The analyses confirmed that writing dispositions are related to three affective stances: confidence, persistence, and passion toward writing.",
