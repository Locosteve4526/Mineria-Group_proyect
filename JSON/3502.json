        "Description/Abstract": "This phenomenological study explored five undergraduate students' experiences in a web-based general science course through the lens of social cognitive theory, while thematic analysis was used to examine the emerging themes of their self-regulated learning (SRL). Our findings revealed that the participants exerted a variety of SRL strategies in the web-based learning environment (WBLE) with the facilitation from instructional elements and strategies: planning with the online calendar, monitoring progress with the online gradebook, and sustaining motivation with instructor's virtual presence via multimedia capability of the WBLE. They were also able to adapt to the WBLE by adjusting their study routines, note-taking strategies, and seeking help in order to succeed in this web-based course. Design implications were provided based on our findings in this research.",
