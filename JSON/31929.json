        "Description/Abstract": "For the past two years, I have used a fully flipped classroom in my undergraduate Thermodynamics of Materials course.  This workshop is meant to not only share that experience (the strengths and also areas for improvement), but to also help participants think about how they could flip even just a single day in their own class.  In order to successfully flip a class, the instructor needs to pay attention to how students prepare, how the content is delivered, and how they will ensure readiness among students.  More importantly, perhaps, is what actually takes place when the students and instructor are together \u2013 the time traditionally used for lecture.  This workshop will engage participants in using and planning active learning strategies that support student learning.  These strategies can be built upon each other to fill up a flipped class session, but could also be used separately to make a lecture more interactive and engaging for students. ",
