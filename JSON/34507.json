        "Description/Abstract": "challenges of the education system: under-qualified teachers and low teacher retention.  With special education teachers nationally leaving the profession after approximately 2.5 years, district and school administrators turn to lesser-qualified applicants to work with students with disabilities - one of our most vulnerable community populations.  We, as teacher educators, are in a position of moral, ethical, and professional obligation to better support the next generation of special educators.  Statistics are demonstrating that education preparation for special education teachers is not creating the positive and long-lasting impact necessary to support students with disabilities.  We must begin to re-consider the practices we are utilizing at the teacher preparation level, re-evaluating how we can more effectively and efficiently support special education teacher candidates.  \nCurrently, research specific to special education teacher preparation is lacking (Bishop, Brownell, Klingner, Leko, &amp; Galman, 2010; Conderman, Johnston-Rodriguez, Hartman, &amp; Kemp, 2013; Lako &amp; Brownell, 2011). Further, the high demand for qualified special education teachers is not currently being met with traditional teacher preparation programs (TPPs) alone, due to the programs\u2019 extensive time requirements.  This contributes to the increasing number of alternative route preparation programs that provide \u201cfast-tracked\u201d initial certification without the focus on content or pedagogical expertise when compared to traditional preparation programs (Hardman, Rosenberg, &amp; Sindelar, 2005).  Without sufficient preparation to meet the demands that the job entails, dismal retention rates exist for special education teachers.\nThis roundtable session will present preliminary findings from a self-study of 5 clinical practitioners who act as a Professional Practice Liaison Team in a fully-online special education Masters in Teaching program.  With participants, we would like to discuss implications of self-study results on teacher preparation practices in special education, and further to inquire into more efficient and/or effective practices in supporting team-based clinical supervision in graduate teacher preparation programs.",
