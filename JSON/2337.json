        "Description/Abstract": "When electronic portfolios (e-portfolios) are employed as summative assessments for degree granting programs, it is imperative that graduate students demonstrate their knowledge in the field to showcase learning growth and achievement of the program learning outcomes. This study examined the extent master's degree students in the field of educational technology demonstrated their technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) related elements in their e-portfolio reflection, when they were guided by TPACK framework grounded instruction. Using content analysis technique and open-ended survey responses, the findings show that graduate students were able to demonstrate their interconnected technological pedagogical knowledge in their reflection to justify their competencies. In addition, graduate students had positive reactions to the opportunity to reflect through writing the reflection paper. This study contributes to the e- portfolio literature by signifying the importance of providing a discipline-specific framework to guide students\u2019 reflection of learning. The TPACK grounded instruction helped graduate students stay focused on their reflection. This study also contributes to the TPACK literature by demonstrating the extent to which graduate students presented their integrated knowledge of TPACK at the end of a program driven to developing students\u2019 technology integration expertise.\r\n",
