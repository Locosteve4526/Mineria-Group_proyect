        "Description/Abstract": "Reactions involving the VITiIVAl-VIAlIVSi exchange in muscovite, biotite, and hornblende were calibrated thermodynamically using a set of experimental and natural data in rutile-plus quartz/coesite-bearing assemblages. The specific respective reactions are \nK(Al2)(AlSi3)O10(OH)2 + TiO2 = K(AlTi)(Al2Si2)O10(OH)2 + SiO2 (R1)\nK(?MgAl)Si4O10(OH)2 + TiO2 = K(?MgTi)AlSi3O10(OH)2 + SiO2 (R2)\nCa2Mg3Al2Al2Si6O22(OH)2 + 2TiO2 = Ca2Mg3Ti2Al4Si4O22(OH)2 + 2SiO2. (R3)\nIdeal mixing on octahedral or octahedral plus tetrahedral sites and a non-ideal van Laar solution model yield the best regression results for thermodynamic fit parameters, with R2 values of 0.98\u20131.00. Isopleths of the equilibrium constant (Keq) show minimal pressure dependencies of &lt;1 &gt;\u00b0C/kbar, implying that the equilibria are poor barometers. Model reproducibility of the ideal portion of the equilibrium constant (Kid) is excellent (ca. \u00b10.1 to 0.3, 2?), but the absolute value of the combined term ?S+Kid is quite small (absolute values from 0 to 4), so calibration residuals propagate to temperature errors &gt;\u00b150\u2013100 \u00b0C, 1?. Whereas the consistency of a mica or hornblende composition with a known T can be evaluated precisely, Ti chemistry in these reactions is sensitive to composition and does not resolve T (or P) well. The activity of TiO2 in rutile [a(rt)] was also evaluated using both the garnet-rutile-ilmenite-plagioclase-quartz (GRIPS) equilibrium and our new calibrations in rutile-absent, ilmenite-bearing rocks whose peak P-T conditions are otherwise known. Metapelites have average a(rt) of 0.9 (GRIPS) and 0.8 (R1), whereas amphibolites have a(rt) of 0.95 (GRIPS and R3). A value for a(rt) of 0.80 \u00b1 0.20 (metapelites) and 0.95 +0.05/?0.25 (amphibolites) is recommended for trace-element thermomobarometers in ilmenite-bearing, rutile-absent rocks. The dependence of Ti contents of minerals on a(rt) and the reequilibration of Ti during metamorphic reactions both deserve further exploration, and may affect application of trace-element thermobarometers.",
