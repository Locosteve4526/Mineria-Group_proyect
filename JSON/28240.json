        "Description/Abstract": "With the increasing use of security technology, technical at- tacks should become more difficult leading attackers to em- ploy social engineering as a means to obtaining unautho- rized access to information. Therefore, social engineering is a potentially dangerous threat to information security. Fortunately, a number of countermeasures have been pro- posed to defend against it. These countermeasures include implementing policy, providing end-user and key personnel education, and performing security audits. However, most current prominent information assurance curricula do not di- rectly address social engineering and only indirectly address the countermeasures. Amending these curricula to include social engineering as a topic may help students be better prepared for encountering social engineering threats.",
