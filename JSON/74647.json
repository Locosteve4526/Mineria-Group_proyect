        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Transform plate boundaries can be significant sources of seismicity, and those with a component of oblique convergence may be crucial for understanding the process of subduction initiation. The Queen Charlotte Plate Boundary (QCPB) is a transform boundary separating the Pacific and North American plates offshore western British Columbia. The QCPB is one of Earth\u2019s fastest slipping continent-ocean transforms and is a source of large earthquakes in the northeastern pacific. The 2012 M7.8 Haida Gwaii thrust earthquake and its tsunami renewed interest in the QCPB, especially in its southern section that experiences oblique convergence (from ~5-25\u00b0). Mechanisms to accommodate the oblique convergence fall into two end members: crustal thickening of the Pacific plate or underthrusting of the Pacific plate, both of which could produce the Queen Charlotte Terrace (QCT), a bathymetric high offshore Haida Gwaii. Previous subsurface imaging is limited to shallow-penetrating studies that leave most of the QCT\u2019s deep crustal structure largely unknown. Here, we use multichannel seismic reflection data collected in 2021 acquired with a 15 km-long hydrophone streamer to study the crustal structure offshore Haida Gwaii. Our images reveal for the first time that Pacific plate crust and sediment is underthrusting beneath the QCT, topped by the Haida Gwaii thrust. The Haida Gwaii thrust extends to the shelf, near the QCF at depth and along-strike for at least ~170 km, elevating the seismic and tsunami hazard in this region. The QCT is made from sub-parallel ridges formed by thin-skinned thrust faults branching off the Haida Gwaii thrust, which accommodate the oblique convergence along with the underthrusting. Strain is partitioned between the QCT and the QCF, which suggests that the terrace is more analogous to an oblique subduction zone crustal sliver than to other transform plate boundaries. The region offshore Haida Gwaii may represent an early stage of subduction initiation.&lt;/p&gt;",
