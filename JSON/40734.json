        "Description/Abstract": "Since it was formalized by Kane (1990, 1992), the argument-based approach to validation has been promoted in the field of educational and psychological measurement as the preferred method for validating interpretations and uses of test scores. Validation is currently discussed in terms of arguments, and since arguments are both interactive and social, the present review is to systematically examine the scholarly arguments about validation which appear in n = 83 papers on argument-based validation methods which appear in peer-reviewed journals. The findings suggest that the scholars reviewed generally agree on the nature and importance of argument-based validation but disagree on which elements to place in the foreground and whether validation should be structured or unstructured, formal or informal. Reviewers discuss implications for validation practice and offer promotion of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, &amp; NCME, 2014) as\na starting point for broad consensus in the field.",
