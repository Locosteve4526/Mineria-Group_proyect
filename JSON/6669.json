        "Description/Abstract": "Initial-boundary value problems for nonlinear differential-functional equations are considered. A general class of lines method is investigated. The Perron-type estimation for the right-hand side of the equation with respect to the functional argument is assumed. The proof of the convergence is based on a comparison theorem for differential-difference inequalities. A numerical example is given.",
