        "Description/Abstract": "An asymmetric planar molecule, 4-trans-2-(pyrid-4-yl-vynyl) benzoic acid (PVBA), has been used to establish the organic chiral recognition on fcc(111) metal surfaces. The strong correlation between the orientation and chiral recognition of PVBA on both Ag(111) and Pd(111) guides the choice of a model potential, which determines the relative binding energy of PVBA on fcc(111). An angle-dependent calculation of relative binding energy reproduces the experimental observation of the chiral recognition of PVBA on Ag(111) but not on Pd(111).",
