This recording was submitted to the International Clarinet Association (ICA) as part of a proposal to perform at the 2018 ClarinetFest, to be held in Ostend, Belgium. We were notified in December 2017 that our performance proposal was accepted for ClarinetFest 2018. We performed at the conference in July, 2018. A program is attached.",
