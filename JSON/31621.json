        "Description/Abstract": "Many gaseous exoplanets in short-period orbits are on the verge or are in the process of Roche-lobe overflow (RLO). Moreover, orbital stability analysis shows tides can drive many hot Jupiters to spiral inevitably toward their host stars, and the distributions of orbital periods and semi-major axes point to non-negligible orbital decay during the main sequence lifetimes of the host stars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape the observed distribution of close-in exoplanets. However, the exact outcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass loss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO. Applying the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) suite to model RLO, we find that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several properties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass of the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion that accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that depends on the core mass. We suggest that RLO may often strand the remnant of a gas giant near or interior to this orbital period, providing an observational prediction that can corroborate the RLO hypothesis. We conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the observed population of small, short-period planets and find some planets in orbits that may be consistent with this picture. ",
