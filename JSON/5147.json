        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to qualitatively examine factors related to physical activity adherence to understand why women   continue to participate in long-term exercise after completing a structured exercise program. Data were collected from focus   groups, interviews, and e-mails, and analysis used grounded theory. The central category related to physical activity adherence   was self-worth. Motivation, activity enjoyment, priorities, body image,  ability to access support, and self-regulation skills had    an impact on the self-worth of nonadherers and adherers. Women must value themselves enough to continue to participate in   physical activity once they start. Exercise and fitness professionals  are encouraged to use strategies to increase self-worth and   long-term adherence to physical activity. Some recommended strategies include (a) increasing motivation and enjoyment relative   to activity, (b) making activity a high priority in a woman's life, (c) improving or deemphasizing body image, (d) increasing   a woman's ability to access support, and (e) facilitating the use of  self-regulation strategies. This study is the first to examine   qualitative perspectives of exercise adherence among women who completed a structured exercise program. Several concepts   related to adherence presented in the quantitative literature are confirmed and enhanced in this study.",
