        "Description/Abstract": "Assesses how students feel about test delays and their perceptions of the effect on class performance. Two instances of test delays were examined that varied in class level and how the situation was resolved. Ss were 534 college students. Results of survey questions indicate that the lower level class (Introduction to Psychology) felt the delay hurt their performance, while the upper level class (Personnel and Industrial Psychology) felt the delay helped their performance. Alternative explanations to these conclusions are also discussed.",
