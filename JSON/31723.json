        "Description/Abstract": "Last year we unveiled a new web page on the DPS Education site listing all the graduate programs we could find that can lead to a PhD with a planetary science focus. The list is meant to be a first-look point for undergraduate students and undergraduate advisors where they can find and compare programs across a set of very basic criteria, then follow links to the web sites of those programs for further information. We did this because the field of planetary science is incredibly diverse, typically is not a stand-alone department, and navigating all the possibilities can overwhelm even a determined undergraduate student\u2014and even many advisors.Over the past year we have striven to add programs as we are made aware of them, fill in missing information for known programs, and continually update the information we do have. In addition we have moved forward on plans to implement the most asked-for feature: filtered searching.We present here the updated site and a preview of the transitional site needed before full filtered searching can be implemented. In addition we will present design notes for the full-featured version in order to elicit feedback from the community. Finally, we call upon those mentoring and advising undergraduates to use this resource, and program admission chairs to continue to review their entry and provide us with the most up-to-date information.
