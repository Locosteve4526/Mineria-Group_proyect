        "Description/Abstract": "The tiger moth Bertholdia trigona is the only animal in nature known to defend itself by jamming the sonar of its predators \u2013 bats. In this study we analyzed                      the three-dimensional flight paths and echolocation behavior of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) attacking B. trigona in a flight room over seven consecutive nights to determine the  acoustic mechanism of the sonar-jamming defense. Three mechanisms                      have been proposed: (1) the phantom echo  hypothesis, which states that bats misinterpret moth clicks as echoes;  (2) the ranging                      interference hypothesis, which states that moth  clicks degrade the bats' precision in determining target distance; and  (3)                      the masking hypothesis, which states that moth  clicks mask the moth echoes entirely, making the moth temporarily  invisible.                      On nights one and two of the experiment, the bats  appeared startled by the clicks; however, on nights three through seven,                      the bats frequently missed their prey by a distance  predicted by the ranging interference hypothesis (?15\u201320 cm).  Three-dimensional                      simulations show that bats did not avoid phantom  targets, and the bats' ability to track clicking prey contradicts the  predictions                      of the masking hypothesis. The moth clicks also  forced the bats to reverse their stereotyped pattern of echolocation  emissions                      during attack, even while bats continued pursuit of  the moths. This likely further hinders the bats' ability to track prey.                      These results have implications for the evolution  of sonar jamming in tiger moths, and we suggest evolutionary pathways by                      which sonar jamming may have evolved from other  tiger moth defense mechanisms.",
