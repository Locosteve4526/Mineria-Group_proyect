        "Description/Abstract": "This study examined changes in physical activity and perceived exercise benefits, barriers, and benefit-to-barrier differences in mothers and daughters who participated in 12-week home-based (HB) and university-based (UB) physical activity interventions. Two (group) by two (time) repeated measures ANOVAs and effect sizes showed an increase in physical activity in both groups. Mothers in both groups reported a significant decrease in exercise barriers (p = .01, ES = .41). Exercise benefits and barriers did not change for daughters, nor did exercise benefits change for mothers. These two interventions were successful at increasing physical activity, but changes in EBBS scales differed by age and point in time measures were taken. This information can be used to plan better interventions for girls and women.",
