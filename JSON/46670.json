        "Description/Abstract": "Empirically derived predictive models describing synthesis\u2010structure relationships have the potential to significantly improve and guide future research in a more cost\u2010 effective and timely manner; however, few of these models exist for cation ordering in perovskites. In this study, four compositions within the AZn0.5Ti0.5O3 system (A = Nd, Sm, Nd0.5La0.5, Nd0.5Gd0.5) were synthesized using a conventional solid\u2010 state mixed\u2010oxide method. X\u2010ray diffraction data show evidence of long\u2010range 1:1 rock salt cation ordering on the B site for all compositions. Additional data for other rock salt B\u2010site ordered compositions were mined from literature. Correlative models for the B\u2010site shrinkage (\u0394rB) have been derived for each B\u2010site ordered system, and a general model has been developed for rock salt B\u2010site ordering from these specific models. This general model allows for the prediction of the room\u2010temperature volume shrinkage resulting from rock salt B\u2010site ordering using only published ionic radii data.",
