        "Description/Abstract": "This paper explores the differential effect of love on self-esteem among men and women. Among a number of variables examined, love was the most important determination of self-esteem for both men and women. However, love was much more important for women than for men. Women had both the lowest and the highest self-esteem in this sample depending on the level of love they perceived themselves to be receiving.",
