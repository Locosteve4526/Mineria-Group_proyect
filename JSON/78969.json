        "Description/Abstract": "A controlled experiment at the Harry W. Morrison Dam on the Boise River in Boise, Idaho, USA, was conducted to study the mechanism that controls spectral amplitude variations in seismic and acoustic signals recorded around the dam. The dam is a 56~m river-wide feature equipped with pneumatic pumps and hydraulic flash boards. The pumps and boards can be adjusted in real time to vary the height and angle of the dam; adjustments to these dam controls lead to variations in the behavior of the hydraulic jump (i.e. wave shape) generated by the dam spillover. The hydraulic jump can be characterized by the dimensionless Froude number, and as we altered the Froude number the river discharge and dam pool height varied. During this time, the character of the seismo-acoustic field generated by hydraulic also changed. In this presentation we demonstrate the preliminary results of our seismo-acoustic experiment. We identify a correlation between the Froude number and the spectral content of the seismic and acoustic waves. This suggests that the Froude number is related to the generated frequencies. Beyond the spectral character of the signal, we perform a semblance based source location to demonstrate that observed signals are generated at the hydraulic jump. Seismo-acoustic observations made during this controlled experiment provide insights into the structure of natural and man made hydraulics features.",
