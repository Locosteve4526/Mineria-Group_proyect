        "Description/Abstract": "Intimidation and threats of future victimisation are obstacles battered women often face when attempting to leave abusive relationships. Thus, all possible means of protecting battered women at this most dangerous time should be employed. This paper presents findings from a study in the US designed to determine the nature and extent to which domestic violence programs use security technology to protect battered women. Security technology includes panic alarms, cellular phones, home security devices, electronic monitoring of the offender and/or the property surrounding the victim's home, and surveillance or closed circuit cameras. The data collected through this survey will assist in determining whether domestic violence programs are utilizing the advances made in security technology. The findings are used to discuss the relationships between demographic variables, primary funding sources, type of program, and the use of security technology.",
