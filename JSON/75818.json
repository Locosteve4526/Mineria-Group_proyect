These numbers are no surprise given the flexibility and customization of over a hundred services offered by AWS. This presentation will focus on three services used for application hosting: (1) Elastic Compute Cloud, (2) Beanstalk, and (3) Lambda. We will compare and contrast these services to better understand the best choice for a given business scenario.",
