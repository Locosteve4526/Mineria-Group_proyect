        "Description/Abstract": "In composition studies, contract grading has been shown to benefit first-year writing students, particularly underrepresented students or those deemed under-prepared. However, little research has examined contract grading in technical communication settings. Given data drawn from one student's experience, course evaluations, and the instructor's shift in approaches to assessment, this use of contract grading shows strong potential to support student success, particularly for minority students or first-generation, Pell-eligible students often at risk. In addition, it fits within best practices drawn from work in the Designing for Student Success Faculty Learning Community. While contract grading presents challenges for students used to a traditional model, it aligns assessment practices with pedagogical orientations that ensure students with a range of abilities and backgrounds can be successful.",
