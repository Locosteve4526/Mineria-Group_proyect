        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\nProvider adherence to system of care principles in service interactions with families is an important indicator of behavioral health service quality for youth; however, valid and pragmatic measures suitable  for  monitoring  this  quality  indicator  at  population  scale  have  not  been  developed.  This paper reports on two studies that developed and evaluated such a measure. In Study 1, an iterative, family-partnered process resulted in generation of 18 items that demonstrated unidimensionality and strong reliability among caregivers of youth participating in behavioral health services (N = 141). In Study 2, data from a second, statewide, stratified random sample of caregivers (N = 351), confirmed  the  items\u2019  unidimensionality,  discriminant  validity,  and  criterion-related  validity. Higher scores on the System of Care Adherence Scale were associated with lower risk of youth psychiatric  hospitalization,  greater  perceived  improvement  in  youth  functioning,  and  greater increases in caregivers\u2019 self-efficacy to access services. Item response theory analyses indicated the  items  were  strongly  related  to  adherence;  however,  most  were  optimal  for  differentiating between  low  to  moderate  levels  of  adherence.  The  System  of  Care  Adherence  Scale  is  a psychometrically  sound  measure  suitable  for  population  surveillance  of  the  extent  to  which families experience system of care principles in their interactions with providers. \n",
