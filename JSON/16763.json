        "Description/Abstract": "Heat transfer characteristics of a prototype light-weight protective vest were\nevaluated under controlled laboratory conditions. Vest surface temperatures, manikin skin temperatures, and total body heat gain profiles were documented. The new protective vest design, including spacers and an aluminized external surface, was found to provide an\ninfrared heat radiation attenuation level of 53.7%. The results indicate that use of such a\nnovel reflector garment vest can help reduce heat stress for persons exposed to intense\noutdoor sunlight conditions.",
