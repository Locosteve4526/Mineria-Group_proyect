        "Description/Abstract": "Presented by Seattle\u2019s Northwest Film Forum, the 23rd Annual Local Sightings Film Festival [Online] is a virtual showcase of creative communities from throughout the Pacific Northwest. The 2020 program, which runs from September 18-27, features a competitive selection of curated short film programs and feature films, inviting regional artists to experiment, break, and remake popular conceptions around filmmaking and film exhibition.\nLocal Sightings 2020 champions emerging and established talent, supports the regional film industry, and promotes diverse media as a critical tool for public engagement.\n\nMore and more artists find technological immersion in their laptops and mobile phones a way not only for creation (their virtual studio), but also for the diffusion and sharing of what they do and create. In a way we can say that the place of art is moving fast. It is a powerful and complex, socially active, global tectonic that the old vertical, bureaucratic and speculative structures of official art that they call 'contemporary' are unlikely to resist.\n",
