        "Description/Abstract": "Officer wellness has become a well-deserved focus within our profession. In recent years we have become increasingly concerned with officer retention and satisfaction, and preventing burnout, turnover, and even suicide. But what about the law enforcement executive? This session will reveal what we\u2019ve learned about chiefs' burnout, disengagement, satisfaction, and turnover from a national study of 741 police chiefs conducted by our presenter. He will also supplement with data from a study of 916 police chiefs in Texas, and a separate study of turnover among 164 Texas chiefs. This presentation will focus on describing burnout, satisfaction, and turnover, and the factors associated with each. Additionally, Dr. King will review possible best practices in preventing disengagement, burnout, and turnover among police chiefs.",
