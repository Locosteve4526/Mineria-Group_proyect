        "Description/Abstract": "Disclosed is a compression-resistant container that overcomes at least one of the shortcomings described above. In an embodiment, the container incorporates alternating cylinders and spheres across the body of a bottle. As the bottle is compressed, the spheres distribute some of the vertical load across the surface (i.e., absorbing strain horizontally), which increases the amount of force that is required to compress the bottle. Also, as the bottle is distorted, adjacent spheres provide a support surface and prevent the collapse of the other spheres. This shape makes the bottle more difficult to flatten during recycling, thereby preventing PET bottles from commingling with paper during the automated sorting process.",
