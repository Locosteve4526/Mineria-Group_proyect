        "Description/Abstract": "Mastering practical application of real-time digital signal processing (DSP) remains one of the most challenging and time-consuming pursuits in the field. It is even more difficult without a resource to bridge the gap between theory and practice.\nFilling that void, Real-Time Digital Signal Processing from MATLAB\u00ae to C with the TMS320C6x DSPs, Second Edition is organized into three sections that cover enduring fundamentals and present practical projects and invaluable appendices. This updated edition gives readers hands-on experience in real-time DSP using a practical, step-by-step framework that also incorporates demonstrations, exercises, problems, coupled with brief overviews of applicable theory and MATLAB\u00aeapplications.\nEngineers, educators, and students rely on this book for precise, simplified instruction on use of real-time DSP applications. The book's software supports the latest high-performance hardware, including the powerful, inexpensive, and versatile OMAP-L138 Experimenter Kit and other developmental boards.\nIncorporating readers' valuable feedback and suggestions, this installment covers additional topics (such as PN sequences) and more advanced real-time DSP projects (including higher-order digital communications projects), making it even more valuable as a learning tool.",
