        "Description/Abstract": "Several humic materials are characterized by flow field-flow  fractionation, including humic acids, a fulvic  acid, and aqueous leachates from compost. Hydrophilic and  hydrophobic fractions of a compost leachate were also examined. After  characterizing molecular weight distributions, the effect of pH and salt  concentration on hydrodynamic size is studied. In general, the  hydrodynamic size decreases as the pH is lowered. However, humic acids  form large aggregates below pH 5. Small amounts of sodium chloride have little effect on the  size distributions. In contrast, a little calcium  chloride reduces the hydrodynamic  size of individual molecules while inducing the formation of oligomers,  although severe aggregation is absent. With further additions of calcium chloride,  the decrease in hydrodynamic size continues but oligomer formation  subsides. Precise characterization of the unaggregated material is  hindered by sample penetration through the channel membrane.",
