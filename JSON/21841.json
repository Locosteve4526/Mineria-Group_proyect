        "Description/Abstract": "This book project, Pandemic Modernity: the Aesthetics and Ethics of Illness in Modernist Literature, argues for the centrality of illness in shaping modernist literature in three ways.  First, I examine the role illness plays in modernist fiction\u2019s staging of questions of being and of ethics.  Second, I consider an under-examined aspect of the historical context of modernism to argue that the Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918-19 should be understood as a pivotal influence shaping modernist fiction.  Third, I suggest that the experimental aesthetics of modernism share with illness the effect of creating perspectives that make the familiar strange. \nRole:  Principal",
