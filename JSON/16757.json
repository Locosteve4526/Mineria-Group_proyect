        "Description/Abstract": "Occupation related exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation can result in significant health risks. These risks include accelerated skin aging, sun burn, heat stress, and skin cancer. Clothing is considered important in protecting against such risks. Laboratory tests were performed to measure the penetration characteristics of UV and IR radiation through selected fabric samples. The results show that fabric layering, color, moisture, and stretch influence UV and IR radiation penetration differently. While the fabric samples exhibited a UV radiation penetration in the range of 3% to 14% the samples exhibited IR radiation penetration in the range of 83% to 88%.  This difference must be considered when assessing the potential health risk associated with occupational exposures to intense outdoor solar radiation.",
