        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\n\nDNA binds to cell-surface proteins on human and murine leukocytes and induces secretion of the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). Cell-surface DNA binding molecules have been shown to serve as target antigens for the production of autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and in lupus-prone mice. Recent studies have demonstrated that a subset of anti-anti-DNA antibodies, isolated from patients with SLE, are idiotypically related to antibodies reactive with a cell-surface DNA binding molecule. We now report that immunization of normal mice with a murine monoclonal anti-DNA antibody induces an anti-idiotypic response which has reactivity with a cell-surface DNA binding molecule. An anti-idiotypic anti-DNA monoclonal antibody (LB17) was isolated from the spleen of an immunized mouse. This monoclonal antibody blocked the binding of DNA to murine splenocytes and mimicked the functional effect of DNA by stimulating the secretion of IL-6. These experiments provide further evidence for an idiotypic connectivity between antibodies to cell-surface DNA binding proteins and anti-DNA antibodies. It is hypothesized that this idiotypic system is part of the network of natural autoantibodies and that its perturbation may give rise to pathogenic antibodies.\n",
