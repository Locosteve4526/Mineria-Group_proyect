Prebriefing may provide a vital opportunity for students to reflect-before-action prior to participating in simulation thus improving student learning outcomes. Exploring the relationship between prebriefing structure and student learning outcomes may allow faculty to ensure simulation learning outcomes are more readily  met.",
