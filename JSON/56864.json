        "Description/Abstract": "The World Health Organization has stressed the need to address social determinants of health (SDOH) in reducing health disparities and promoting health and well-being for patients. Public health professionals are stakeholders in identifying, addressing and resolving health inequities at the population level while frontline health care workers address inequities on individual\u2019s health. While both address SDOH, they may not be aware of differences in how each mitigates the impact of SDOH on populations and individuals. Therefore, the intersectionality of healthcare and public health disciplines in addressing SDOH is a focal point for impact at the community/population and individual health level. \nAs IPE evolves, health educators are challenged to create inclusive learning opportunities for clinically and population health focused disciplines. Efforts at ETSU for IPE  have grown from three disciplines to numerous programs within the health sciences colleges. As part of a continuous improvement process, IPE program developers embraced critique from public health students and faculty indicating a need to better incorporate public health students in largely clinically based simulation activities.\nCurricular changes occurred by adding an asynchronous online IPE program for public health, and clinically focused health care students. Course developers created case-based scenarios that encouraged student collaboration and engagement asynchronously. This presentation discusses the curricular change including SDOH case-based simulation and feedback from students.",
