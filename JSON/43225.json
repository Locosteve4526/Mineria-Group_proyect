        "Description/Abstract": "In July 2017 researchers discovered that a large municipal water source for Wilmington, North Carolina, the Cape Fear River, was contaminated with the chemical GenX.The source of the contamination is an upstream factory which had been releasing the chemical into the Cape Fear for several years. Potential health effects of GenX exposure are largely unknown and municipal water systems in Wilmington, NC are unable to filter the chemical from the water supply. We exploit spatially varying water sources (municipal wells and the Cape Fear River), to evaluate the effect of the GenX contamination discovery on property prices in the area. While GenX is no longer being released into the Cape Fear River there is the potential for significant property price effects between the time of the discovery and when the pollution was curtailed by state regulators.",
