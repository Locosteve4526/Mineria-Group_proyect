        "Description/Abstract": "The authors searched in four major databases and used snowballing methods to locate 15 experimental or quasi-experimental mCSCL studies, and nine of these studies were included for analysis considering the appropriateness of research method aligned with the scope of this paper, the rigor in research design and the clarity in research report. The following aspects regarding existing experimental research on mCSCL were reported: 1) Student level, content domain, group size and software; 2) Mobile OSs and mobile applications (apps) used to support CSCL; 3) The effects of mCSCL on learning performance, engagement, participation and interaction; 4) Types of mCSCL intervention. It is also found that three areas have been lacking in experimental research in mCSCL: 1) Using mobile devices with Web 2.0 applications and social media to promote interaction; 2) Expanding the context to higher education; 3) Examining affordances of currently dominant mobile devices and mobile operating systems for collaborative learning.",
