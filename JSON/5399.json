        "Description/Abstract": "The retention of both underivatized and carboxylated polystyrene latex  beads by electrical field-flow fractionation (EIFFF) was investigated  using a 2 mM aqueous solution of quinonehydroquinone as the carrier  liquid. The quninone-hydroquinone redox couple passes current with less  polarization of the electrodes than carrier liquids previously employed.  Underivatized beads, ranging in diameter from 0.15 to 0.74 ?m eluted in  the normal mode, while carboxylated beads larger than 1 ?m eluted in  the steric mode. Normal mode retention increases with flow rate,  probably due to shearing of the polarization layer, which increases the  working field. At a constant field and flow rate, normal-mode retention  is inversely related to the product of a particle's size and  electrophoretic mobility, in accordance with retention theory. Thus,  ElFFF can be used to obtain both the size and electrophoretic mobility  of particle suspensions.",
