        "Description/Abstract": "This article reports the results of a case study about elementary school teachers' induction experiences. Four teachers began the three-year study, but only two remained in the profession after their second year. This development was consistent with estimates that 40-50% of novices leave the profession within five years (Smith &amp; Ingersoll, 2004). Bandura's (1977) construct of self-efficacy beliefs was used as a lens to examine how personal characteristics and professional experiences either contributed to new elementary teachers' success, increased sense of self-efficacy, and desire to remain in the profession, or contributed to their desire to leave teaching.",
