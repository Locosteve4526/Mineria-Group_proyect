        "Description/Abstract": "Learning in the field \u2013 what is often called experiential learning \u2013 promises to provide a holistic learning experience that extends the scope and scale of student learning. Much is written about the places where this learning occurs and the various opportunities those places afford, yet the experience of the student in those places is often backgrounded. Although there are many dimensions to the student experience of learning in the field, in this project I focus only on one broad dimension: the relative comfort (or discomfort) that the student feels. Ultimately, I aim to understand the role that the experience of (dis)comfort plays in student learning, guided by the intuition that discomfort can be a&lt;br&gt;powerful motivation for the sort of transformational learning that experiential learning promises. More specifically, I explore the ways that physical discomfort from being outdoors, e.g. feeling hot/cold, muscle fatigue, uneven footing/seating, can challenge students in ways that prompt cognitive growth.",
