FAR,10995,111615748,111615748,Engineering by design: Connecting Engineering and Elementary Education,2006.0,Hawaii Education,Hawaii,,,"To increase the preparedness for and interest in engineering, as well as math-science skills in our youth, a new course has been developed with cooperation between the Colleges of Education and Engineering at Boise State University. This course is presently titled “Engineering for Educators” and its goal is to reach more K-12 students for longer periods of time and at earlier ages than most engineering/math/science outreach activities allow. The pre-service teachers in elementary education are mixed with engineering students in an existing “Introduction to Engineering” course. The education students get an extra hour a week with an education professor to discuss how the engineering projects in the course could be used in the elementary classroom to meet state teaching standards for math and science as well as reading, writing and other non-technical subjects. Combining the educators in with the engineers has three main benefits. First, the education students work along side the engineering students and get to see what the engineering entails. Second, the elementary education students learn that they have the skills and ability to understand and teach engineering activities. Third, by interacting with the engineering students, the educators can break down some of their stereotypical views of engineers and they may be more likely to recommend this field to their future K-8 students when they see a student with the appropriate interests. Although this reports on the first two semesters that the course was offered, those involved have seen several improvements in student attitude, both engineering and education students. However, the most telling improvement is the confidence level of the education students. They have found that they can play a valuable part in any team project. Although they may not feel they have the necessary math skills they are able to organize, analyze and synthesize the ideas. Also, once the math is explained to them they realize that they do understand the concepts. The education students are also seeing numerous ways that the course projects could be used in the schools. Plans are to continue to offer this course in the following semesters with expectations for higher enrollment including some practicing teachers. This course has also been accepted as a substitute for the elementary science methods course offered by the Education College and will be offered as such in the Spring 2006.",,[],,"[{""id"": 10995, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2006, ""termid"": ""2006/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

We contend that the almost diametrically opposed assumptions of Protestantism, which undergirds much entrepreneurship research, may yield misleading conclusions in an Islamic setting. As a result we propose a study of female entrepreneurship through an Islamic lens. Women were chosen because Islamic institutions are designed to yield distinct results across men and women thus giving highly contrasting results when compared to a Western interpretation.

However, there is virtually no empirical research in the German literature about their impact on cost system or firm performance. This exploratory study provides a working definition of GPK for research and tests conceptual path models of antecedent and process factors affecting its adoption and implementation within German-speaking firms. Based primarily SEM analysis of survey data, there is support that both contextual and cultural factors lead to antecedent conditions that make GPK more likely to be adopted. Further analysis of firms who have adopted GPK suggests that GPK accuracy is more a function of top management support, while the number of GPK practices implemented is more a function of the capability of the information system.

But what is world literature? How does one teach it to American students some of whom have little to no knowledge of cultures outside their own? What is at stake in teaching world literature instead of the conventional British and American literatures? In context of recent debates over the discipline of postcolonial studies, I think aloud in this paper my own ideas about teaching world literature. As such I expect the paper to be read as an exercise in contemplation. In what follows, I ‘argue’ in favor of a pedagogy that not only situates the teaching of world literature in a postcolonial world, but also in a posthuman world. Issues such as where it [world literature] is taught, to whom it is taught, and how it is taught, I believe, cannot be separated from the issue of ‘when’ it is taught.

The study investigated (1) the effectiveness of using a systematically sequenced and managed, self-paced e-learning program, ALEKS, on academic performance of students with different learning styles, and (2) the relationship among the students' dominant learning styles, motivational characteristics, and overall performance in the Precalculus class. Students in the experimental group, consisting of 2 of the 4 sections of the course, were assigned to complete ALEKS as homework assignments throughout the semester. Students in the control group, consisting of the other 2 sections of the course, completed a series of traditional paper-and-pencil homework assignments instead. Students' dominant learning styles were measured by Gregorc Style Delineator™. Their motivational orientations and learning strategies were measured with the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. A pre-test and a post-test, measuring students' entry- and exit-knowledge levels in Precalculus, were administered in both experimental and control groups at the beginning and at the end of the semester. This study revealed that sequential-type students who used ALEKS outperformed sequential-type students who completed handout homework assignments and random-type students who used ALEKS or handout homework assignments by one letter grade, although this difference was not statistically significant. Several instructional implications related to students' learning styles, motivational characteristics, and academic performance are discussed.

During the course, she recorded her observations and experiences in the classroom. The math professor also shared reflections on his teaching, observations of his students, and perspectives on the influence of her presence in his class. The two professors' reflections enabled us to identify a set of student assumptions and learning behaviors that would likely influence their learning outcomes in both positive and negative ways. We developed a survey questionnaire based on the identified student assumptions and learning behaviors. At the end of the course, we administered the survey with the calculus students in order to obtain the students' perspectives. By triangulating the three sources of information and through our self-reflections on the results, we have generated recommendations on teaching strategies to which math and engineering instructors might need to pay attention, in order to better understand students and to provide them with more meaningful learning experiences.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/ipt_facpubs/31,"[{""id"": 24083, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2012/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This vocabulary includes terminology pertaining to the materials themselves, as well as terminology defining the construction processes using the materials. Courses such as these form a backbone of knowledge that is necessary in nearly every other CM course. Students are often not prepared for the amount of self-directed studying they must do to be successful in this type of course, particularly as freshmen in college. This paper examines the self-reported study habits of 68 students enrolled in a freshman level CM materials and methods course. This paper presents some insights into how students study for exams and what resources they use (or do not use). The paper also presents preliminary findings indicating that many students appear to have a lack of accurate self-knowledge, defined as the ability to accurately judge one’s level of knowledge, and a lack of self-regulation, defined as the ability to adjust one’s behavior to ensure that acquisition of missing knowledge is successful.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/construct_facpubs/17,"[{""id"": 24446, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2012/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Moving engineering education research into practice is a more complicated task than it might initially seem. There are many significant barriers to hinder the transition from research to implementation. These barriers can be categorized into two groups: (1) individual barriers, such as personality characteristics that contribute to a lack of willingness to implement innovations, as well as a lack of knowledge about engineering education research; and (2) environmental perceptions, such as perceptions of the tenure and promotion process that suggest a lack of support for innovations. The project discussed in this paper investigates the characteristics of faculty members who successfully adopt engineering education innovations and studies the impact of their working environment on their decision to adopt. Additionally, the project investigates characteristics of faculty members who do not adopt engineering education innovations and whether that decision was affected by perceptions of their working environment. This paper describes preliminary results of a data collection effort identifying current barriers faculty members have in the adoption of innovations in engineering education. This paper presents data from two perspectives, that of self and colleagues. These perspectives are part of a larger 360° approach for data collection that also includes the perspectives of students, experts in education innovation - such as the director of a center for teaching and learning, administrators, and published documents.

However, it is limited to a small radius of influence (ROI) surrounding the air injection well. Hence, there have been several efforts to improve its effectiveness. To study the possibility of improving the effectivity of air sparging electromagnetic (EM) waves, an easily visible analogous problem (dye transport in water) is studied in this paper. In order to quantify the effects of EM stimulation on flow of an inert, nonreactive dye in water, EM-stimulated and unstipulated dye transport experiments tests were performed and compared. To quantify this interaction, both dye transport and EM wave propoagation (only the electric field component Z) are quantified experimentally in lab-scale. In addition to the experimental mapping of the electric field at limited location on depth (i.e., vertical) slices, the electric field is simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics 4.1 in three dimensions (3D) for accurate field analysis. Transport analysis of the dye was performed using digital imaging to determine temporal and spatial concentration variations. The results show a visible effect on the dye transport mechanisms (i.e., fingering and diffusion). However, further study is needed to validate the proposed correlation between the electric field and the transport mechanisms.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/civileng_facpubs/38,"[{""id"": 24593, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2011/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
FAR,24600,112188448,112188448,A Data Assimilation Approach for the Prediction of Soil Moisture at Tactical Scales Fusing Multiple Scale Data Sources and Models,2010.0,,"Orlando, Florida",,,"Soil moisture is a critical environmental variable that impacts military trafficability through its impact on soil load bearing capacity. Adequate knowledge of soil moisture at scales of individual hillslopes (10s to 100s of m) would substantially improve efforts to assess trafficability and assist in erosion mitigation strategies on military lands. Field-based observations of soil moisture at the necessary high resolution over large areas is impractical, particularly for many Army operations. On the other hand, hydrologic models can simulate spatial patterns in moisture at the required scales, but are subject to errors in the model inputs and formulation. Anticipated L-band microwave remote sensing platforms offer accurate global observation of geo- physically obervable quantities that are related to soil moisture at revisit intervals of 2-3 days, but are too coarse in spatial scale for trafficability assessment. Numerical data assimilation provides a mathematical framework to leverage the benefits of models and remotely sensed observations, while potentially compensating for their respective weaknesses. This work provides a proof-of- concept illustration of how data assimilation with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) can be used to improve hillslope-scale estimates of soil moisture. In a synthetic experiment in the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed in Arizona, USA, we show that immediately after a rainfall event, ingesting L-band microwave radar data into a watershed ecohydrology model using the EnKF increases the accuracy in a watershed-scale mapping of trafficability. Moreover, we demonstrate how the estimate of uncertainty in soil moisture provided by the EnKF can be used to convey risk in trafficability assessment.",,[],,"[{""id"": 24600, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2010, ""termid"": ""2010/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

It is consequently not surprising that Ludwig Wittgenstein’s work, particularly in the Philosophical Investigations, has been taken up by philosophers of education in English. Michael A. Peters (1999), Christopher Winch (2002), Smeyers & Burbules (2010), and others (e.g. Aparece 2005) have engaged extensively with the implications of the later Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mind and language for education. One challenge that that they face is Wittgenstein’s use of the word “training” throughout his discussions of language learning and in his periodic references to education. This is made all the more problematic by realizing that the term Wittgenstein actually used was Abrichtung, which refers exclusively to animal dressage or obedience training, connoting also the breaking of an animal’s will. I argue that little-recognized fact has broad significance for many important Wittgenstinian insights into education, effectively meaning that the gap between present and future generations is one of coercion and pain, rather than upbringing and care. This paper sheds light on these, and concludes by considering how an unflinching recognition of the implications of Wittgenstein’s choice of words casts him as a tragic philosopher of education and upbringing.",,[],http://normfriesen.info/papers/Lost_in%20_Translation.pdf,"[{""id"": 24669, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 24669, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2015, ""termid"": ""2015/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

These campuses serve as both feeder schools for the main campus and also offer baccalaureate and associate degrees in a number of STEM majors. Considering the number and geographic diversity of the campuses involved and the number of different STEM fields served, this effort is significant. The project is based on three intervention strategies and an assessment strategy. The three intervention strategies include: (a) enhanced tutoring programs for foundational mathematics courses in algebra, trigonometry, and calculus, (b) a freshman toy-based design course (called Toy FUN-damentals) in which dissection and re-design of toys is used to engage students in a positive environment, and (c) a math-intensive summer bridge program offered at three regional campuses to facilitate underrepresented engineering freshmen as they transition from high school to college. The strength of this project lies in the comprehensive scope of the interventions as well as its large sample size.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/edtech_facpubs/64,"[{""id"": 25117, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2012/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,26036,112045153,112045153,Bridging the Valley of Death: A Preliminary Look at Faculty Views on Adoption of Innovations in Engineering Education,2012.0,,,,,"There is a nationwide need to better translate engineering education research into the classroom setting. Moving engineering education research into practice is a more complicated task than it might initially seem. There are many significant barriers to hinder the transition from research to implementation. These barriers can be categorized into two groups: (1) individual barriers, such as personality characteristics that contribute to a lack of willingness to implement innovations, as well as a lack of knowledge about engineering education research; and (2) environmental perceptions, such as perceptions of the tenure and promotion process that suggest a lack of support for innovations. The project discussed in this paper investigates the characteristics of faculty members who successfully adopt engineering education innovations and studies the impact of their working environment on their decision to adopt. Additionally, the project investigates characteristics of faculty members who do not adopt engineering education innovations and whether that decision was affected by perceptions of their working environment. This paper describes preliminary results of a data collection effort identifying current barriers faculty members have in the adoption of innovations in engineering education.

FAR,26451,112180039,112180039,Bridging the Valley of Death: A Preliminary Look at Faculty Views on Adoption of Innovations in Engineering Education,2012.0,,,,,"There is a nationwide need to better translate engineering education research into the classroom setting. Moving engineering education research into practice is a more complicated task than it might initially seem. There are many significant barriers to hinder the transition from research to implementation. These barriers can be categorized into two groups: (1) individual barriers, such as personality characteristics that contribute to a lack of willingness to implement innovations, as well as a lack of knowledge about engineering education research; and (2) environmental perceptions, such as perceptions of the tenure and promotion process that suggest a lack of support for innovations. The project discussed in this paper investigates the characteristics of faculty members who successfully adopt engineering education innovations and studies the impact of their working environment on their decision to adopt. Additionally, the project investigates characteristics of faculty members who do not adopt engineering education innovations and whether that decision was affected by perceptions of their working environment. This paper describes preliminary results of a data collection effort identifying current barriers faculty members have in the adoption of innovations in engineering education. This paper presents data from two perspectives, that of self and colleagues. These perspectives are part of a larger 360° approach for data collection that also includes the perspectives of students, experts in education innovation - such as the director of a center for teaching and learning, administrators, and published documents.

As part of the project, we have developed a series of MATLAB-based simulations delivered through our Blade servers to help students better conceptualize abstract Math concepts. During the fall semester of 2010, we implemented 12 simulations in a Multivariable & Vector Calculus class in which 117 students were enrolled. To better understand the overall program usability via Blade servers and the value of the simulations from the student perspective, we conducted an evaluation study and answered the following three questions: 1. How do students perceive the use of interactive simulations in their Math class? 2. How do students? motivational characteristics (e.g., intrinsic and extrinsic goal orientations and confidence levels in studying science, math and engineering) relate to their perceptions in using simulations during the Math class? and 3. What aspects of the simulation programs should be improved? The study revealed that about 74% of students rated the value of simulations as high or moderate. The simulations tend to be attractive to students with high intrinsic goal orientation, while their value perceptions were not related to students' extrinsic goal orientation and confidence levels. The data also showed areas for improvement, based on which we have generated a ""things to do"" list to make the simulation programs more easily accessible and valuable to students in the future semesters.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/ipt_facpubs/7,"[{""id"": 26684, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2011/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The assigned project was to design a biomedical robot to work in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) to perform tasks such as transporting supplies or delivering paperwork. Students with diverse skills and majors were grouped in ten teams, two to three students each. Student learning activities included designing a robot from a box of FisherTechnik materials, without the aid of instruction manuals; writing program code using the PCS environment; and integrating hardware and software. After four weeks of building, training, and testing, each teampsilas robot was unique. In the final competition, each robot was assigned to a particular room in the ICU to perform a specific task.

Students were asked to write down as many famous or historically important scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. After one minute, they were instructed to write down as many famous or historically important women scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. For the first question, 95% of the responses referred to male scientists, inventors or engineers. For the second question, respondents named on average less than one woman (M=.86), and those named were more often from non-STEM fields (e.g., Rosa Parks) than actual scientists, inventors or engineers. Additionally, while respondents named a total of 279 distinct men, they named only 35 distinct women. Students in STEM fields could name significantly more male scientists, inventors or engineers than non-STEM students, but could not name significantly more women. The implications of these results are discussed, along with suggestions for educators on how to integrate the contributions of women in STEM into the classroom.",,[],http://www.asee.org/public/conferences/8/papers/3444/view,"[{""id"": 27106, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2012/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Published research has provided a robust set of documented tools and techniques for transforming individual engineering courses from traditional lecture-based formats to those that emphasize project- and problem-based learning[1]. These new formats support transfer of learned skills to subsequent courses and the workplace. Unfortunately, the mere availability of such research has not resulted in its widespread adoption across engineering programs. The pace of adoption has been slow and sporadic, which has led researchers to identify a ""Valley of Death"" separating research and practice [2]. Attempts to encourage widespread adoption of research-based engineering education practices by ""pushing"" effective techniques on faculty via workshops have not produced consistent results.

This paper describes a method for evaluating and visualizing persistent conversations by creating a speech act profile for conversation participants using speech act theory and concepts from fuzzy logic. This method can be used either to score a participant based on possible intentions or to create a visual map of those intentions. Transcripts from the Switchboard corpus, which have been marked up with speech act labels according to a SWBD-DAMSL tag set of 42 tags, are used to train language models and a modified hidden Markov model (HMM) to obtain probabilities for each speech act type for a given sentence. Rather than choosing the speech act with the maximum probability and assigning it to the sentence, the probabilities are aggregated for each conversation participant creating a set of speech act profiles, which can be visualized as a radar graphs. Several example profiles are shown along with possible interpretations. The profiles can be used as an overall picture of a conversation, and may be useful in various analyses of persistent conversations including information retrieval, deception detection, and online technical support monitoring.",,[],,"[{""id"": 28221, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2004, ""termid"": ""2003/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

At the same time it also provides for the possibility of detecting and tracking their deceptive communication. Recent advances in natural language processing, machine learning and deception research have created an environment where automated and semi-automated deception detection of text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC, e.g. email, chat, instant messaging) is a reachable goal. This paper reviews two methods for discriminating between deceptive and non-deceptive messages in CMC. First, Document Feature Mining uses document features or cues in CMC messages combined with machine learning techniques to classify messages according to their deceptive potential. The method, which is most useful in asynchronous applications, also allows for the visualization of potential deception cues in CMC messages. Second, Speech Act Profiling, a method for quantifying and visualizing synchronous CMC, has shown promise in aiding deception detection.

At issue is whether various forms of CMC enable or deter successful deception. Synchronous (real-time) CMC was hypothesized to foster more involvement and mutuality during communication, more credibility for team members, and hence less detection of deception when it was present. Team performance was hypothesized to suffer under deception due to deceivers capitalizing on synchronous communication to build their credibility. Two-person teams conducted a decision-making task in real time (synchronous) or over the course of several days (asynchronous). In half of the pairs, one party was asked to be deceptive. Participants in the synchronous mode were perceived as showing more involvement and mutuality, and viewed their partners in a more favorable light, than participants in the asynchronous mode. Deceivers portrayed themselves as more credible than truthtellers. Participants in the deceptive condition made poorer decisions than participants in the truthful condition.

A study of the fore-mentioned groups using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is discussed and the results anticipated from the groups' participation in a problem-solving task and subsequent group analysis survey.

Students were asked to write down as many famous or historically important scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. After one minute, they were instructed to write down as many famous or historically important women scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. For the first question, 95% of the responses referred to male scientists, inventors or engineers. For the second question, respondents named on average less than one woman (M=.86), and those named were more often from non-STEM fields (e.g., Rosa Parks) than actual scientists, inventors or engineers. Additionally, while respondents named a total of 279 distinct men, they named only 35 distinct women. Students in STEM fields could name significantly more male scientists, inventors or engineers than non-STEM students, but could not name significantly more women.

This can be very influential in a text-based domain. In recent years, tools have been developed that, while not initially designed for this domain, have been adapted successfully for use in identifying deception in text-based communication. These text analysis tools, which utilize features such as parsing and categorizing, are emerging as accurate tools to identify cues that may be useful in distinguishing deceptive from truthful communications. These deception detection tools have been applied to problems such as security screening, criminal incident statements, and evaluation of online communication patterns.

FAR,29603,112180039,112180039,Bridging the Valley of Death: A preliminary look at faculty views on adoption of innovations in engineering education,2012.0,,,,,"There is a nationwide need to better translate engineering education research into the classroom setting. Moving engineering education research into practice is a more complicated task than it might initially seem. There are many significant barriers to hinder the transition from research to implementation. These barriers can be categorized into two groups: (1) individual barriers, such as personality characteristics that contribute to a lack of willingness to implement innovations, as well as a lack of knowledge about engineering education research; and (2) environmental perceptions, such as perceptions of the tenure and promotion process that suggest a lack of support for innovations. The project discussed in this paper investigates the characteristics of faculty members who successfully adopt engineering education innovations and studies the impact of their working environment on their decision to adopt. Additionally, the project investigates characteristics of faculty members who do not adopt engineering education innovations and whether that decision was affected by perceptions of their working environment. This paper describes preliminary results of a data collection effort identifying current barriers faculty members have in the adoption of innovations in engineering education. This paper presents data from two perspectives, that of self and colleagues. These perspectives are part of a larger 360° approach for data collection that also includes the perspectives of students, experts in education innovation - such as the director of a center for teaching and learning, administrators, and published documents. This 360° approach provides a foundation for bridging the gap, often referred to as the 'valley of death,' between engineering education research and the common practice of engineering education.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/construct_facpubs/18,"[{""id"": 29603, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2012/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

After one minute, they were instructed to write down as many famous or historically important women scientists, inventors or engineers they could think of. For the first question, 95% of the responses referred to male scientists, inventors or engineers. For the second question, respondents named on average less than one woman (M=.86), and those named were more often from non-STEM fields (e.g., Rosa Parks) than actual scientists, inventors or engineers. Additionally, while respondents named a total of 279 distinct men, they named only 35 distinct women. Students in STEM fields could name significantly more male scientists, inventors or engineers than non-STEM students, but could not name significantly more women.

The conflict in Ukraine drew attention to the memory wars there. Putin’s Russia prepared the groundwork for the annexation by engaging in memory warfare, by re-writing the history of the past to include claims on the lands of the former (PLC). In the 2010 “Unified History” the PLC is “an evil from the West.” Communist historiography underscored that Kyivan Rus’ was the precursor to Russia, and many Russians still accept the idea that Russia is descendant of Kyivan Rus’, how could the PLC equally trace its origins to the land? Since 1991, no common consensus has emerged on the collective memory of the PLC supporting a positive view of the PLC in Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine. While Polish scholars embraced the memory of the PLC, there is public indifference and reluctance to embrace the legacy of the PLC in Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine. But if the people of Lithuania and Belarus have no universal mass memory of the legacy of the PLC, this is certainly no accident. The erasure of the memory the PLC and the cultivation of mass amnesia was the policy first of the empire that partitioned the state, then the nationalists who forged 19th century linguistically-based identities, and later by the Soviets.

FAR,31243,112184269,112184269,Learning to Create a Culture of Feedback,2016.0,,,,,"Abstract: Conferring with student writers one-on-one is notoriously hard to do well. Research offers guidance on what happens in a good conference, but little is known about how any teacher actually learns to do it. This interactive session will focus on research and teaching experiments addressing how teachers learn to confer. -- Conferring with student writers one-on-one is a key component of teaching writing, but it’s notoriously hard to do well. The challenges of conferring are at once practical and philosophical: We want the student to maintain authority as author of the writing, but what if he/she just says “it’s done?” We want students to do most of the talking, but what if the student isn’t talking? We want to engage with every student, but certain students seem needier than others. We want to help students, but we also want them to have experiences problem-solving on their own. And there is never, ever enough time. Research shows that conferring is an important instructional opportunity; and we have in research and practical literature good guidance on the content and conduct of individual conferences (Anderson, 2000; Calkins, Hartman, & White, 2005; Crochunis, 2009; Freedman & Katz, 1987; Glasswell, Parr, & McNaughton, 2003; McIver & Wolf, 1999; Murray, 1979). However, little is known about how any teacher actually learns to do it. This session will focus on research and teaching experiments addressing how teachers learn to confer. Attendees will have opportunities to interact directly with classroom data and discuss emerging findings about the development of conferring skills. In Part One, “Learning to Confer in Collaboration between Mentors and Interns,” a university researcher and two classroom teachers will share research focused on conferring practices of a second grade teacher, a third grade teacher, and their two classroom interns. Using Swivl devices, interns and their mentors collected audio and video data of themselves conferring during the same writer’s workshop class period. They viewed and analyzed these collaboratively with a critical partner, developing shared values and norms for conferring. These could then be taken back to writer’s workshop and built upon iteratively-- for the interns as they prepared for their own classrooms and careers, and for the mentors as they both extended their own partnership and began the following year with new interns. In Part Two, “Learning to Create a Culture of Feedback,” a university researcher and teacher educator will first share how he works with undergraduate teacher candidates to instill a value of feedback and sound practices for providing it to K-12 writers. A series of in-class experiences and field experiences helps to develop skills for conferring within a framework of understanding feedback. Then, he will discuss how that same framework informs work with more experienced teachers in a graduate course. In Part Three, attendees will have opportunities for discussion using data excerpts and example teaching materials from the two projects described. References Anderson, C. (2000).

IT is used in this research in order to have an initial evaluation of the surface and near surface of concrete structures in a time effective manner. The method can be widely used for concrete pavement, particularly bridge decks inspection. In this paper we have studied one of the important aspects that has a major effect on infrared thermography technique which is the depth of delamination inside concrete structure. In order to mimic the delamination in subsurface, two Styrofoam cubes have been inserted in different depth near the surface of the concrete cylinder. After heating up the specimen, thermal images were taken from the surface using an infrared thermal camera to evaluate the effect of subsurface defects on the detection sensitivity and accuracy. We also investigated the precision to which the shape and the size of the sub-surface anomalies can be perceived using an uncooled thermal camera. To achieve this goal, we used image processing technique to accurately compute the size of delamination in order to compare it with the actual size. Also thermal/distance graph is used as a complimentary method to detect the presence of the defect underneath the concrete surface. This method can be used when we are inspecting a wide area of concrete structure e.g. bridge decks. Furthermore, thermal transfer modelling was adopted in this paper to assist the setup of this experiment and the results are compared with laboratory findings.",,[],,"[{""id"": 32460, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This article presents a numerical study for the analysis of the thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of concrete with Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) around individual aggregate. Attention was given to the simulation of concrete having different phases such as, cement paste, aggregate and particularly the ITZ surrounding the aggregates. All the boundary loads and temperatures were static to keep the simulation as simple as possible. A parametric study was conducted to observe the variation of deformations and stresses depending on the variation of the porosity of ITZ. It was found that deformation of concrete depends on the variation of temperature as well as the porosity of ITZ. Two different failure functions were used to evaluate the potential failure location. Both of the failure functions agree with the identified failure locations.",,[],,"[{""id"": 32461, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The Anm model places multiple irregular shape particles into a pre-defined empty box according to the real parking density to build up particles embedded in matrix material model in all scales from nano to macro. However, the packing accuracy and efficiency need to be improved, since the original Anm model’s algorithms has limited function and relative low parking efficiency. Furthermore, it cannot control the inter-particle distance. In this paper, we upgraded the initial algorithms by the following innovations: 1) integrated a new contact function, extending overlap box (EOB) to make the contact detection more accurately and efficiently; 2) the particle parking algorithm has been implemented to associate multiple aggregate shape database with each size bin; 3) an uniform thickness shell has been put around each parking particle, which can make the inter-particle distance customizable when we park nano-scale particles considering possible charge interactions between individual nano-particles.",,[],,"[{""id"": 32462, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2015, ""termid"": ""2014/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

A statistical analysis was performed to study the packing density and shape effects with a large number of modeled particles. The lunar soil simulant JSC-1a was developed to study simulant soil behaviors for large and medium scale engineering studies in support of future human activities on the Moon. Parameters such as particle size distribution, specific gravity, angle of internal friction, and cohesion have all been investigated. However, no research has been performed to explore the microstructural behaviors and their influences on the engineering properties as a whole. As such, Anm model can provide us a useful approach to investigate microstructural features of lunar simulant, e.g. charge contact, lofting, transport, stratification and adsorption. Thus the virtual JSC-1a microstructure can be used to study lunar soil handling, construction, excavation, and transportation. Furthermore, the uniform-thickness shell is a customized parameter to control the minimum inter-particle distances. Integrating this algorithm into individual particles packing, the Anm model can be used to create a virtual lunar regolith to investigate the particle contact charging properties at the individual particle scale. In general, this virtual lunar soil simulant model could provide a broad range of applications to lunar surface missions. It is a potential tool for modeling the behavior of the lunar soils, and accurately predicting the geotechnical properties of lunar soils for lunar base planning and construction.",,[],,"[{""id"": 32463, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FCS which relies on correlation function analysis (CFA) is a very powerful tool used for single molecule and single cell measurements that provide new insights into biomolecular interactions. FCS time series analysis coupled with the use of deep time- series neural networks provides better insight into a data set than correlation functions alone. Typical correlation functions average over many molecular events to give an average characterization of concentration, mobility, binding or enzymatic processivity. One benefit of coupling CFA with deep-learning is the added ability to perform quantitative measurements in the presence of noise. In some cases fluorescence signal noise arises from a lack of detector measurement efficiency (shot noise) or high signal intensities. Other fluorescence signal noise sources include low frequency photobleaching, or high frequency oscillations. Ultimately such noise degrades the cross-correlation signal. In this paper, we illustrate a systematic approach for identifying noise in fluorescence data. We illustrate how traditional CFA can be enhanced through the use of a deep time-series neural network, and how wavelet transforms facilitate signal noise isolation and root cause analysis in both stationary and non-stationary fluorescence signals. In this paper, we describe a unique systematic approach for detecting fluorescence signal noise in a two-signal FCS system.",,[],https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01177-2_2,"[{""id"": 33280, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

One component in determining from whom and how knowledge is most effectively transferred to employees is to gauge how employees perceive the effectiveness of training. The primary goals of this research were to assess employee's perceptions of the effectiveness of training by first assessing the types and methods of training that they are provided, and then to assess their perception of the effectiveness of that training. Towards this end, a survey was conducted to collect data concerning the perceived effectiveness of fall protection training from employees of small commercial construction entities. The resulting data was analyzed to gauge employees perceived effectiveness of training methodologies and to gauge from whom employees perceive training to be most effective. Findings from the study are relevant because understanding employee perceptions of the effectiveness of training will allow for more effective training methodologies to be developed.

Cloud service providers usually put more emphasis on defending outside attacks rather than internal attacks. Thus, data stored on the cloud usually suffers more from insider threats and can be viewed by anyone with access to the server. Our solution is a cloud security strategy where data is selectively and strategically encrypted before it is stored in a cloud server, which renders the data unintelligible to both outside attackers and malicious insiders. The strategic encryption allows for queries to be run over the encrypted data on the server without decryption. Decryption keys are stored within the data owner’s organization and are never revealed to the server, meaning it cannot be decrypted by anyone besides the owner. This allows entities to store highly sensitive data on cloud services without the extra risk associated with cloud storage.",,[],,"[{""id"": 34105, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2017/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

When big security breaches happen, thousands to millions of passwords can be exposed and stored into files, meaning people are susceptible to dictionary and rainbow table attacks. Those are only two examples of attacks that are used to crack passwords. In this paper, we will be going over three open-source password managers, each chosen for their own uniqueness. Our results will conclude on the overall security of each password manager using a list of established attacks and development of new potential attacks on such software.

To address issues related to self-efﬁcacy and teacher preparation, we started a formal program (IDoCode) that not only provides teacher training through the academic year, but also provides teachers the opportunity to obtain a Masters in STEM Education degree or a Graduate Certiﬁcate in Computer Science Teacher Endorsement. Through our program, we have shown that teachers feel more conﬁdent in their ability to teach computer science courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and the Java-based AP CS A, as well as leading the students in a capstone project. In this paper, we present a sustainable approach to make a cultural change in the landscape of Computer Science education in the state of Idaho. We discuss various factors including working with the State Board of Education, local software companies, the university, and other invested partners to help CS courses in high school count towards graduation. We have also been active with respect to community engagement by organizing an annual meeting with counselors and principals to encourage women and minorities to take computer science courses and conducting summer professional development workshops for new teachers.",,[],,"[{""id"": 34108, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,34414,113122305,113122305,Ten Years Later: Where are they Now?,2017.0,ASEE,,,,"Ten Years Later: Where are they Now? This paper is focused on exploring the educational and career trajectories of the alumnae of an outreach activity for girls. The outreach activity was originally developed using an integrated marketing approach to attract girls into engineering programs [Ref]. It involves a two day, overnight experience for exiting 9th, 10th and 11th grade girls, and focuses on showcasing engineering as an exciting, creative activity, including activities developed from that perspective. Started in 2005 and held annually since then, a total of over 500 girls have participated, with approximately 85% of them coming from the University’s immediate metropolitan area. Facilitated by the College of Engineering, and largely staffed by volunteering women engineers from the region, the outreach event takes place in a small metropolitan city in the United States. At the time of its onset this was the only outreach or camp activity in that state focused on girls or young women in engineering and science. The college-going rate in this state is very low, so there is interest in any programming that increases that rate - especially for girls in engineering. The specific topic of this paper is an investigation into what has transpired in the girls’ lives relative to their educational and career plans since they participated in the program. We are interested in using the pathways forward for these girls to better understand the impact the program may be having as well as to be able to better tell the story about how one program can influence such plans. Participants in this research project are drawn from the population of 418 alumni of the program who are currently at least 18 years of age. Participants in this population for whom we have a verified email address will receive a survey (n= 173). The survey will collect information from past participants focusing on what other STEM related extracurricular programs they participated in, their post-secondary activities (education and career), and what impacted those choices. Additional data will be gathered from a smaller sample of alumni who are current students at the University (n = 40) via focus group. The data will be analyzed using qualitative methods and this paper will report on the results of the analysis. Implications for program design and follow up activities will also be discussed.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/28938,"[{""id"": 34414, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2017/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The new Engineering Plus degree has a core set of required foundational courses in engineering, a multi-year design sequence, and allows for self-defined pathways. The new curriculum also offers three defined degree pathways that have been chosen based on an examination of student “fate” data: secondary education, pre-medical, and environmental studies, with additional pathways planned for the near future. The fate analysis examined the paths of students who were enrolled in an engineering or STEM major in one year and samples their major choice in the following year. This analysis maps the flow of students into and out of the major with demographic slicers to more closely understand these in-migration and out-migration choices.

The initial wooden or metal cast fonts have mostly disappeared. In this paper we address the creation of character templates from printed documents. Images of characters scanned from Renaissance era documents are segmented, then clustered and a template is created from each obtained cluster of similar appearance characters. In order for subsequent typeface analysis tools to operate, the template should reduce the noise present in the individual instances by using information from the set of samples, but the samples must be homogeneous enough to not introduce further noise into the process. This paper evaluates the efficiency of several clustering algorithms and the associated parameters through cluster validity statistics and appearance of the resulting template image.

The need for this support was a result of both Boise State University College of Engineering’s transition from a 2-year pre-engineering program to the establishment of Bachelors of Science in Engineering Degree programs in 1997 as well as the establishment of the College of Western Idaho as a regional community college in 2007. Both of these factors led to an increase in the numbers of incoming engineering students transferring from other institutions of higher education to complete their degree. These students were generally ineligible for most Boise State University scholarship programs which are mainly aimed toward students entering college directly from high school. In this paper we describe how our program connected transfer students with university staff, faculty and resources. To date, this program has a 100% retention rate, with the exception of one student on an official leave of absence, and a projected 100% graduation rate with 91% of the students already graduated.

The need for this support was a result of both Boise State University College of Engineering’s transition from a 2-year pre-engineering program to the establishment of Bachelors of Science in Engineering Degree programs in 1997 as well as the establishment of the College of Western Idaho as a regional community college in 2007. Both of these factors led to an increase in the numbers of incoming engineering students transferring from other institutions of higher education to complete their degree. These students were generally ineligible for most Boise State University scholarship programs which are mainly aimed toward students entering college directly from high school. In this paper we describe how our program connected transfer students with university staff, faculty and resources. To date, this program has a 100% retention rate, with the exception of one student on an official leave of absence, and a projected 100% graduation rate with 91% of the students already graduated.

FAR,36554,112088556,112088556,Interaction Between Electromagnetic Waves and Transport in Saturated Media,2012.0,,,,,"Air sparging is one of the most popular remediation technologies. However, it is limited to a small radius of influence (ROI) surrounding the air injection well. Hence, there have been several efforts to improve its effectiveness. To study the possibility of improving the effectivity of air sparging electromagnetic (EM) waves, an easily visible analogous problem (dye transport in water) is studied in this paper. In order to quantify the effects of EM stimulation on flow of an inert, nonreactive dye in water, EM-stimulated and unstipulated dye transport experiments tests were performed and compared. To quantify this interaction, both dye transport and EM wave propoagation (only the electric field component Z) are quantified experimentally in lab-scale. In addition to the experimental mapping of the electric field at limited location on depth (i.e., vertical) slices, the electric field is simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics 4.1 in three dimensions (3D) for accurate field analysis. Transport analysis of the dye was performed using digital imaging to determine temporal and spatial concentration variations. The results show a visible effect on the dye transport mechanisms (i.e., fingering and diffusion). However, further study is needed to validate the proposed correlation between the electric field and the transport mechanisms.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/civileng_facpubs/38,"[{""id"": 36554, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2011/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The 1,032-page volume left Melville’s library following his death in 1891. It was discovered in the 1930s, subsequently lost, and rediscovered in 1999. Twice rebound and missing its original endpapers (and therefore, most likely, Melville's usual ownership inscription), the extremely brittle volume has been photographed by Houghton Library and digitized at Melville’s Marginalia Online. Along with following the historian’s account of English literature from the Eleventh Century to the poetry of the Reformation, Melville’s markings and annotations reveal his preoccupation with Warton’s attention to subjects “almost unknown to the general reader.” His marginalia gravitate uncannily to Warton’s discussions of lost works, dispersals of libraries, works rescued from oblivion, languages and writings concealed by ecclesiastical dictates, banned writings, and esoteric modes of literary expression—all topics with deep aesthetic and biographical connections to Melville's own writings and to his failed career as a popular author. The book also contains marginalia on writers Melville had already studied in still-surviving volumes, such as his copies of Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton, whose works had profoundly influenced his own writings, as well as unique marginalia on now-forgotten writers excerpted by Warton, and by whom no works owned by Melville are known to survive. Dating deep within the period of reputational decline that followed his failure as a marketable writer, when he closely studied works of poetry and criticism while quietly pursuing his own sophisticated efforts in verse, Melville’s marginalia in Warton’s History of English Poetry offer an unparalleled look into an obscure but artistically fertile period of his life and thought.",,[],,"[{""id"": 38022, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2020/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 38022, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

FAR,38399,111110323,111110323,Creating a STEM Identity: Investment with Return,2014.0,American Society for Engineering Education,,,,"Creating a STEM Identity: Investment with Return Establishing a strong STEM identity on this metropolitan campus has been an important step toward creating a climate conducive to facilitating fundamental change. Examples of such change include building collaborations among faculty within and across departments,establishing the identity of students as part of a community beyond their chosen major,improving the efficiency and effectiveness of university systems, and perhaps most importantly in higher education, developing a framework to think very purposefully about ways to effect change. The College of Engineering on this metropolitan campus began focusing heavily on student success initiatives in 2004 with support from the Engineering Schools of the West Initiative, through The Hewlett Foundation. This first wave of initiatives was critically assessed,and engineering student success became a focal point for the College of Engineering. Internal research conducted under this grant exposed numerous roadblocks that impeded students' academic success, particularly in the mathematics sequence. In 2010, another large grant, funded through the National Science Foundation Science Talent Expansion Program, was awarded to help focus on increasing the numbers of students graduating with STEM degrees. This grant engaged an interdisciplinary, cross-college team of educators passionate about continuous improvement and pedagogical reform. All activities associated with this grant were deliberately categorized as “STEM” activities, in order to further unify the STEM community and its sense of common purpose. Within approximately one year of the STEP grant's launch, a second grant was awarded, a NSF Innovation through Institutional Integration grant. This paper discusses and presents supporting data to show how creating a STEM identity has been a critical step towards cross-curricular integration and improvements in pedagogical training. Structures and policies have changed on campus. Across campus, educational research and curriculum collaboration is expanding. Information distribution to STEM majors has changed, and a sense of STEM community and culture has emerged.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/20219,"[{""id"": 38399, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Research results to date have been mixed regarding the impact of personality diversity on team process and success. Four experimental teams were formed representing the personality type predominately found in system security professionals. Four control teams were formed as well comprised randomly of diverse personality types dissimilar from that of the security professionals. The results indicate that personality diversity amongst the members of a problem-solving, idea-generating team does not lead to the generation of significantly more creative solutions or ideas as individuals or as a group.

The expansion of the Internet has significantly increased the amount of textual communication received and stored by individuals and organizations. Inundated with massive amounts of textual information transmitted through computer-mediated communication, CMC, people remain largely unsuccessful and inefficient in detecting those messages that may be deceptive. Creating an automated tool that could help people flag the possible deceptive messages in CMC is desirable, but first it is necessary to understand cues used to deceive in textual instances. This study focuses on the identification of deceptive cues deceivers use in a textual CMC environment. 30 dyads (n =14 truthful, n = 16 deceptive) were able to complete the desert survival problem. Findings have demonstrated significant differences between the content within truthful and deceptive messages. Several cues were also found to be significantly more present when deceivers write messages.",,[],http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1173793,"[{""id"": 38899, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2003, ""termid"": ""2003/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The study investigated (1) the effectiveness of using a systematically sequenced and managed, self-paced e-learning program, ALEKS, on academic performance of students with different learning styles, and (2) the relationship among the students' dominant learning styles, motivational characteristics, and overall performance in the Precalculus class. Students in the experimental group, consisting of 2 of the 4 sections of the course, were assigned to complete ALEKS as homework assignments throughout the semester. Students in the control group, consisting of the other 2 sections of the course, completed a series of traditional paper-and-pencil homework assignments instead. Students' dominant learning styles were measured by Gregorc Style Delineator™. Their motivational orientations and learning strategies were measured with the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. A pre-test and a post-test, measuring students' entry- and exit-knowledge levels in Precalculus, were administered in both experimental and control groups at the beginning and at the end of the semester. This study revealed that sequential-type students who used ALEKS outperformed sequential-type students who completed handout homework assignments and random-type students who used ALEKS or handout homework assignments by one letter grade, although this difference was not statistically significant. Several instructional implications related to students' learning styles, motivational characteristics, and academic performance are discussed. Especially, students with a dominant abstract-random style may need more tailored learning support to be more successful in a Precalculus class.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/5591,"[{""id"": 39578, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2009, ""termid"": ""2009/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,39870,111615748,111615748,Interaction Between Electromagnetic Waves and Transport in Saturated Media,2012.0,,,,,"Air sparging is one of the most popular remediation technologies. However, it is limited to a small radius of influence (ROI) surrounding the air injection well. Hence, there have been several efforts to improve its effectiveness. To study the possibility of improving the effectivity of air sparging electromagnetic (EM) waves, an easily visible analogous problem (dye transport in water) is studied in this paper. In order to quantify the effects of EM stimulation on flow of an inert, nonreactive dye in water, EM-stimulated and unstipulated dye transport experiments tests were performed and compared. To quantify this interaction, both dye transport and EM wave propoagation (only the electric field component Z) are quantified experimentally in lab-scale. In addition to the experimental mapping of the electric field at limited location on depth (i.e., vertical) slices, the electric field is simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics 4.1 in three dimensions (3D) for accurate field analysis. Transport analysis of the dye was performed using digital imaging to determine temporal and spatial concentration variations. The results show a visible effect on the dye transport mechanisms (i.e., fingering and diffusion). However, further study is needed to validate the proposed correlation between the electric field and the transport mechanisms.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/civileng_facpubs/38,"[{""id"": 39870, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2011/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The dataset is named the Boise State Bangla Handwriting Dataset. The dataset contains 2 pages. The first has a 104 word/364 character essay. The essay uses 49 basic characters, all 11 vowel diacritics and 32 high frequency consonant conjuncts. The second page contains 84 isolated units containing all basic characters, numbers, vowel diacritics and several high frequency conjuncts. The initial release is based on the voluntary contribution of 100 different writers. One of the highlights and unique features of this database is that all of its contents are tagged with the associated ground truth information from different component hierarchies, such as characters, words and lines. It is expected to be useful for research on offline Bangla handwriting recognition, particularly with segmentation-based approaches. Furthermore, a basic character recognition method is presented where the features are extracted based on zonal pixel counts, structural strokes and grid points with U-SURF descriptors modeled with bag of features. The highest classification accuracy obtained with an SVM classifier based on a cubic kernel is 95.4% using the isolated characters from the Boise State dataset together with 3 other datasets to ensure the versatility and robustness of this process.",,[],,"[{""id"": 39885, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2017/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The need for this support was a result of both Boise State University College of Engineering’s transition from a 2-year pre-engineering program to the establishment of Bachelors of Science in Engineering Degree programs in 1997 as well as the establishment of the College of Western Idaho as a regional community college in 2007. Both of these factors led to an increase in the numbers of incoming engineering students transferring from other institutions of higher education to complete their degree. These students were generally ineligible for most Boise State University scholarship programs which are mainly aimed toward students entering college directly from high school. In this paper we describe how our program connected transfer students with university staff, faculty and resources. To date, this program has a 100% retention rate, with the exception of one student on an official leave of absence, and a projected 100% graduation rate with 91% of the students already graduated.

Most of the research to date has focused on thermodynamic properties or axial and radial stress and strain of piles. This paper focuses on the effects of temperature fluctuation on the capacity of driven energy piles in clayey soils. Consolidation of clay surrounding driven piles affects the pile capacity (i.e., set up in clay). The heating and cooling periods of energy piles can create the excess pore-water pressure (EPWP, ue) or relax the existing one (e.g., due to pile driving or previous thermal loads) in clayey soils (due to the contraction and expansion of water) affecting the pile capacity. In the meantime, the thermal expansion and contraction of the pile also generate or relax the EPWP in the soil, which can be computed using the cavity-expansion theory. This paper studies the resulting changes in the pile capacity due to the daily and seasonal thermal cycles. The results show that thermal cycles in an energy pile can cause a decrease in the pile capacity leading to a delay in reaching the capacity after a complete clay set up.",,[],,"[{""id"": 40089, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The need for this support was a result of both Boise State University College of Engineering’s transition from a 2-year pre-engineering program to the establishment of Bachelors of Science in Engineering Degree programs in 1997 as well as the establishment of the College of Western Idaho as a regional community college in 2007. Both of these factors led to an increase in the numbers of incoming engineering students transferring from other institutions of higher education to complete their degree. These students were generally ineligible for most Boise State University scholarship programs which are mainly aimed toward students entering college directly from high school. In this paper we describe how our program connected transfer students with university staff, faculty and resources. To date, this program has a 100% retention rate, with the exception of one student on an official leave of absence, and a projected 100% graduation rate with 91% of the students already graduated.

I-O models can be modified to include the effects of such expenditures as retirement benefits, tax payments, and charitable contributions. However, even such extended input-output analyses do not provide complete measures of the economic impact of a new firm or research facility's location choice. Additional economic impacts arise when facilities generate additional external economies generated by a new firm or economic facility. These agglomeration effects are essentially overlooked in standard I-O analyses. These agglomeration effects are likely to differ depending on the urban or rural nature of the region in which a facility locates. Urban firm location is more likely to generate localization economies such as those stemming from knowledge spillovers, labor pool effects, and scale economies of input providers. In rural areas, these localization economies are likely to be small. However, location of new firms in rural areas can result in substantial increases in population and income which can then give rise to agglomeration effects as new firms are attracted to the new economic node. As shown by Black, Church and Holley (2004), these agglomeration economies can be large. This paper extends examines whether the agglomeration effects of new capital investment are larger in rural areas than in urban areas.

Understanding such multimodal descriptions and later locating the landmarks from real world is a challenging task for the hearer, who must interpret speech and gestures in par- allel, fuse information from both modalities, build a mental representation of the description, and ground the knowledge to real world landmarks. In this paper, we model the hearer’s task, using a multimodal spatial description corpus we col- lected. To reduce the variability of verbal descriptions, we simplified the setup to use simple objects as landmarks. We describe a real-time system to evaluate the separate and joint contributions of the modalities. We show that gestures not only help to improve the overall system performance, even if to a large extent they encode redundant information, but also result in earlier final correct interpretations.

We implemented a system that can produce what we call “time buying” acts whenever it needs to bridge time until it can present a task-level reply (in our case, flight information). The range of acts and, crucially, the sequencing of these acts (including their temporal placement) are learned from an existing corpus in which such situations were created on purpose. We evaluate this system by letting participants interact with it as well as with two baseline systems: one that only produces one type of act (namely explicitly asking the user to wait) at regular intervals, and another one that produces the full range of acts, but sequenced randomly. We find that participants rate the full system as more human-like than the other systems and that they also report enjoying interacting with it more.

FAR,40557,113084385,113084385,"The impact of surface exposure on carbon decomposition in ancient, buried soils along an erosional gradient",2018.0,,,,,"Buried layers of ancient soil organic matter (SOM) occur throughout much of North America, Europe, and Asia, storing significant amounts of carbon (C). However, erosion may expose this C to modern surface conditions, altering the surrounding biotic and abiotic environment. These changes may enhance the decomposition of ancient C by triggering microbial activity and respiration, thereby increasing the flux of soil C into the atmosphere. Root-derived C inputs and nitrogen (N) deposition can be key factors in ancient C decomposition as exposure to surface conditions increase, however, changes in labile soil C and N inputs to ancient C decomposition along an erosional gradient remain uncertain. Our research aims to evaluate the vulnerability of ancient C stored within paleosols when exposed to C and N inputs. Our field site is in Wauneta, NE where erosion has uncovered areas of a Pleistocene era soil. Formed 10-13 kya, the Brady soil occurs throughout the landscape along erosional toposequences and was collected from 0.2m, 0.4m and 1.2m depths below the surface. The soil was homogenized, root picked, and held at 60% water holding capacity to assess microbial activity in a controlled laboratory incubation study. To evaluate effects of modern root-derived C inputs and N deposition on Brady C decomposition, we applied (1) a lab synthesized root exudate solution to mimic root exudates (0.3 mg C g-1­soil) and (2) ammonium nitrate to simulate atmospheric (wet + dry) and wind-blown agricultural N deposition (30 kg ha-1). The exudate solution was 13C labeled (12 atom% 13C), allowing us to partition between the decomposition of root exudate C and Brady soil C. We calculated microbial CO2 respiration, N mineralization and enzymatic activity on days 0, 3, 14 and 30. Significant increases in soil respiration with root exudate addition - particularly at the shallowest depth - suggest that the ancient Brady C is vulnerable to decomposition when exposed to surface conditions.",,[],,"[{""id"": 40557, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
FAR,40558,113084385,113084385,Vulnerability of Ancient Carbon to Modern Erosional Processes,2018.0,,,,,"As much of the Earth’s landscape is marked by slopes, accounting for erosion effects on soil carbon (C) dynamics is key for regional predictions of C storage. Erosion can deliver C to depositional sites, bury C produced on site, and expose buried C. Buried soils can store more C than expected at equivalent depths. Understanding the effects of landscape destabilization and further erosion on formerly buried soils is important for assessing the vulnerability of ancient C to disturbance. Loess-mantled landscapes, developed under drier conditions than today, often contain buried soils, which could become disturbed by land use and changes in climate. We studied a prominent buried soil, the Brady soil, which has been identified in loess-mantled uplands throughout the U.S. Central Great Plains. Found 6 m below the surface at its deepest, the Brady soil began developing at the end of the Pleistocene and was buried during climate-driven episodic deposition of local loess sources during the early Holocene. The Brady soil was buried at different depths, and today the landforms at our study site in Nebraska are dissected by gullies. The aim of our study was to assess spatial variability in soil properties along burial and erosional transects to improve estimates of C storage belowground as well as evaluate its exposure to modern surface conditions, which could activate losses of ancient C. Specifically, we focus on physical properties that influence C persistence or stabilization and how they may vary with increased weathering as the Brady soil becomes exposed to modern environmental conditions at the surface. Preliminary data revealed that the organic C content of the Brady soil increased as erosional processes caused the Brady soil to be closer to the modern surface. Soil texture of the Brady soil (on average 8% clay, 56% silt, and 36% sand) did not change with depth from the landscape surface. Analysis of clay fractions using X-ray diffraction (XRD) also showed no differences in mineralogy in the Brady soil with increasing exposure to the surface. These results suggest that C inputs, possibly due to an increase in the concentration of roots closer to the surface, may outweigh the loss of C through aggregate disruption and increased microbial decomposition attributed to erosion as the Brady soil becomes closer to the modern surface.",,[],,"[{""id"": 40558, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

We evaluated differences in soil C accumulation and the processes that affect it, under a variety of switchgrass and big bluestem cultivars. Our experiments are located at the Fermilab National Environmental Research Park, Batavia, Illinois, and at the Agricultural Research and Development Center (ARDC), Ithaca, Nebraska. We found considerable within and between-species variability in soil C accumulation. Specific root length (SRL) differed significantly among the swithgrass cultivars with a five fold difference between cultivars with the highest and lowest average SRL. These differences were consistent across a range of growing and drought stress conditions. SRL was a good predictor of soil C input by switchgrass cultivars in the early years of the experiments, however soil C accumulation in the later years appeared to be mediated by processes other than the quantity of root C input. Our data revealed variation in rhizosphere metabolic profiles of switchgrass and big bluestem cultivars as well as in bulk soil microbial communites. Together, our data indicate that we might expect differences among species and cultivars in the chemical composition of root exudate input and microbial residue formation, which may explain variation among cultivars and species in soil C accumulation.",,[],,"[{""id"": 40559, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,41709,111632553,111632553,A certificateless one-way group key agreement protocol for end-to-end email encryption,2018.0,,,,,"Over the years, email has evolved into one of the most widely used communication channels for both individuals and organizations. However, despite near ubiquitous use in much of the world, current information technology standards do not place emphasis on email security. Not until recently, webmail services such as Yahoo’s mail and Google’s gmail started to encrypt emails for privacy protection. However, the encrypted emails will be decrypted and stored in the service provider’s servers. If the servers are malicious or compromised, all the stored emails can be read, copied and altered. Thus, there is a strong need for end-to-end (E2E) email encryption to protect email user’s privacy. In this paper, we present a certificateless one-way group key agreement protocol with the following features, which are suitable to implement E2E email encryption: (1) certificateless and thus there is no key escrow problem and no public key certificate infrastructure is required; (2) one-way group key agreement and thus no back-and-forth message exchange is required; and (3) n-party group key agreement (not just 2- or 3-party). This paper also provides a security proof for the proposed protocol using “proof by simulation”. Finally, efficiency analysis of the protocol is presented at the end of the paper.",,[],,"[{""id"": 41709, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Unified approaches that combine sustainability, resiliency, and analyze risk are very minimal. This paper proposes a unified approach to assessing sustainability, resiliency, and risk for infrastructure via evaluating the performance of a tailings dam under various earthquake magnitudes. A tailings dam is typically in operation for many years, which means they may have a direct impact on the local environment, society, and economy. Due to the extended life of the dam, the probability of a major event occurring that could negatively impact the durability of the dam increases. Hence, it is important to study impacts on the environment and economy under regular (sustainability analysis) and extreme (resiliency analysis) conditions in conjunction with their probabilities of occurrence. This paper studies the interrelationships between sustainability, resiliency and the potential risks of a negative impact upon infrastructure. Results provided show that a unified approach with emphasis on risk offers a more holistic, and accurate depiction of a system’s overall quality.",,[],,"[{""id"": 42002, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2017/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

However, research has shown that women often do more writing during these projects, and that their writing labor is unrecognized or undervalued, particularly when the technical work is viewed as more essential. In this paper, we examine the results of a study focused on the writing component in a year-long senior capstone materials science and engineering (MSE) course sequence. This course requires students to complete projects for clients and produce a written report, among other deliverables. To focus more on writing education, the engineering professors brought in an English professor, who researches engineering communication and is coordinating this project, to consult on assignments, comment on student work, and present on writing topics, including managing the writing aspect of collaborative work. Here, we assess the impacts of interventions on student writing and collaboration, focusing on women’s experiences through a series of interviews. These interviews focused on learning more about women’s past experiences working on teams and the effects of the course interventions. Particular to women’s experiences, we argue that by making the writing labor more visible in the project and insisting that each student contribute to the writing, women’s contributions will not only be clearer but also more explicitly valued and their experiences will be more positive overall. After describing the findings, we offer recommendations to continue improving women’s experiences in project-based classroom settings. These recommendations focus on ways engineering instructors who assign writing can ensure women’s contributions are both visible and valued in evaluation.",,[],,"[{""id"": 42414, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Looking at current textbook histories (e.g., Murphy, 2005; Gutek 2010), one might be forgiven for thinking that educational achievements began with Plato’s Academy or Isocrates’ Paideia. However, in recent years, other scholars have highlighted the accomplishments of non-western cultures, such as those of the Ottoman Empire (Hirschler 2012) or traditional China (Lee 2000). Looking to the ancient Middle East, this paper considers the ways in which the practices and techniques that we still associate with education and schooling—particularly in its most basal forms—have been manifest in very different times and places. In so doing, it seeks to challenge established albeit largely implicit histories of education, narratives that locate the origins of educational practices and techniques in the biology of the human brain (e.g., Metzloff 2009), or in the non- or pre-literate phenomena of apprenticeship (Lave and Wenger 1991) or histories of terms and ideas (Gutek 2010).",,[],,"[{""id"": 42593, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2021/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 42593, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

However, in recent months, Silicon Valley defectors and some education technologists have warned that these technologies enact a form of Skinnerian operant conditioning.

To balance between the precision and the efficiency of an analyzer, developers often manually tune-up analyzer's parameters for a specific program. However, this task can be tedious and time-consuming. To automate the search for the optimal parameters for a program, researchers employ machine learning (ML) techniques, that from the existing data learn the relationship between the program and the optimal parameters, which it encodes in an ML model. The existing, or training, data set, plays an important role in the correctness of an ML model. In this work we investigate whether automatically generated programs are adequate for training an ML model, which determines SPF's configurations for a given Java method. To do this, we compare the performance of a model trained on real programs with that of a model trained on synthetic programs. Our results indicate that while synthetic programs are inadequate for training a model alone, adding them to the training set of real programs improves the classification power of the resulting model.",,[],,"[{""id"": 43167, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 43167, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2017/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Through our program, we have trained over 50 teachers in the greater Boise Metropolitan region, who have in turn taught over 1400 students computing concepts through courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and AP CS A. These courses have an excellent curriculum that contains a mix of computational thinking concepts such as a focus on creativity, abstraction, coding, as well as increasing awareness about the cyber footprint of the students with respect to security and privacy. While the curriculum is excellent, we need to be more mindful about incorporating pedagogical strategies that promote inclusive teaching especially for women and minorities who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science. To address the challenges associated with teaching a truly inclusive course, we developed a new course titled “Inclusive Strategies for Computer Science Education” that draws attention to the strategies that have been studied over the years in STEM and CS education literature. We present the contents of the course along with a post-hoc qualitative survey on the applicability and practicality of the material discussed in the course.",,[],http://fie2018.org,"[{""id"": 43175, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

However, despite near ubiquitous use in much of the world, current information technology standards do not place emphasis on email security. Not until recently, webmail services such as Yahoo’s mail and Google’s gmail started to encrypt emails for privacy protection. However, the encrypted emails will be decrypted and stored in the service provider’s servers. If the servers are malicious or compromised, all the stored emails can be read, copied and altered. Thus, there is a strong need for end-to-end (E2E) email encryption to protect email user’s privacy. In this paper, we present a certificateless one-way group key agreement protocol with the following features, which are suitable to implement E2E email encryption: (1) certificateless and thus there is no key escrow problem and no public key certificate infrastructure is required; (2) one-way group key agreement and thus no back-and-forth message exchange is required; and (3) n-party group key agreement (not just 2- or 3-party). This paper also provides a security proof for the proposed protocol using “proof by simulation”. Finally, efficiency analysis of the protocol is presented at the end of the paper.",,[],,"[{""id"": 43583, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

In recent years, voter turnout has diminished while concerns regarding integrity, security, and accessibility of current voting systems have escalated. E-voting was introduced to address those concerns; however, it is not cost-effective and still requires full supervision by a central authority. The blockchain is an emerging, decentralized, and distributed technology that promises to enhance different aspects of many industries. Expanding e-voting into blockchain technology could be the solution to alleviate the present concerns in e-voting. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based voting system, named BroncoVote, that preserves voter privacy and increases accessibility, while keeping the voting system transparent, secure, and cost-effective. BroncoVote implements a university-scaled voting framework that utilizes Ethereum’s blockchain and smart contracts to achieve voter administration and auditable voting records. In addition, BroncoVote utilizes a few cryptographic techniques, including homomorphic encryption, to promote voter privacy.

ITG brought together 2- and 4-year faculty to develop materials covering a wide range of geoscience topics that were evaluated against a project-specific rubric with criteria related to a focus on societal challenges, developing students’ abilities to address such challenges, and use of student-centered pedagogies. To compare teaching practices when faculty use ITG materials to those used generally in undergraduate geoscience classrooms, we used the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) to observe 43 instructors teaching with ITG materials and categorized classes by total RTOP score as Teacher-Centered (≤30), Transitional (31-49), or Student-Centered (≥50). We also observed 25 of the 43 instructors when they were not teaching with ITG materials. For instructors teaching with ITG materials (n = 43) total RTOP scores average 53.8 (0% Teacher-Centered; 42% Transitional; 58% Student-Centered). For undergraduate geoscience instructors teaching without ITG (n = 278), total RTOP scores average 39.7 (29% Teacher-Centered, 47% Transitional; 24% Student-Centered). For the subset of 25 instructors with paired observations, total RTOP scores average 52.8 (SD = 9.2) when teaching with ITG, higher than the average 42.0 points (SD = 13.5) when teaching without ITG (t(46) = 3.4, p < 0.005; Glass’s delta = 1.2). RTOP scores for instructors teaching with the same ITG unit are similar (17 instructors teaching 7 different units), with differences from 2 to 13 points (avg = 5.3 points). Scores for the same instructors teaching without ITG materials (n = 14) indicate that these instructors don’t inherently teach in a similar way; differences in their total RTOP scores range from 10 to 46 points (avg = 23.2 points).

FAR,43656,112003792,112003792,Active learning practices in the geosciences: Learning from 300+ classroom observations,2018.0,Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs,,,doi: 10.1130/abs/2018am-321614,"Based on the call to train more scientists to fill workforce needs, to lead scientific advances that address social and scientific challenges, and to improve society’s science literacy, STEM faculty have been charged to reform our teaching. Reformed teaching focuses on student learning, often with the use of active learning, problem solving, and critical thinking. Such reform is embraced in the geosciences where the level of implementation varies, ranging from large efforts to overhaul entire courses to smaller changes that also result in improved student learning and engagement. A team of trained observers has quantified reformed teaching with direct observations of 321 geoscience classes across the US using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP). Three categories of classroom instruction based on RTOP scores are used as a proxy for the level of reformed teaching: Teacher Centered (≤30), Transitional (31-49), and Student-Centered (≥50). Data are from introductory and upper-level undergraduate courses that ranged in size from 6 to 275 students. Total RTOP scores do not correlate with class size, level, institution type, or the instructor’s gender, rank or years experience. However, common practices that do characterize Student-Centered classrooms include the use of strategies such as incorporating classroom activities that (1) have students actively engaged with one another; (2) assess student learning with relevant adjustments; (3) engage students in answering and posing questions. Increased use of reformed teaching also correlates with instructors who participate in discipline-based professional development that is aligned with the topics they are teaching. An additional resource is the suite of class materials developed by the InTeGrate STEP Center in the Geosciences that are peer-reviewed, student-tested and freely available and adaptable (http://serc.carleton.edu/integrate). RTOP scores are generally higher when InTeGrate resources are used (n = 43; range = 34-75; avg 53.8) versus when they are not used (n = 278; range = 13-89; avg 39.7), but increased scores are not ubiquitous, which merits further investigation. This discipline-wide study is unique to the geosciences and provides a large dataset that is useful to instructors wanting to reform their teaching practice.",,[],,"[{""id"": 43656, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
FAR,43662,111673752,111673752,Valuing Women’s Contributions: Team Projects and Collaborative Writing,2018.0,,,,,"Team projects offer opportunities for student engineers to learn how to work on a team and produce collaborative written reports. However, research has shown that women often do more writing during these projects, and that their writing labor is unrecognized or undervalued, particularly when the technical work is viewed as more essential. In this paper, we examine the results of a study focused on the writing component in a year-long senior capstone materials science and engineering (MSE) course sequence. This course requires students to complete projects for clients and produce a written report, among other deliverables. To focus more on writing education, the engineering professors brought in an English professor, who researches engineering communication and is coordinating this project, to consult on assignments, comment on student work, and present on writing topics, including managing the writing aspect of collaborative work. Here, we assess the impacts of interventions on student writing and collaboration, focusing on women’s experiences through a series of interviews. These interviews focused on learning more about women’s past experiences working on teams and the effects of the course interventions. Particular to women’s experiences, we argue that by making the writing labor more visible in the project and insisting that each student contribute to the writing, women’s contributions will not only be clearer but also more explicitly valued and their experiences will be more positive overall. After describing the findings, we offer recommendations to continue improving women’s experiences in project-based classroom settings. These recommendations focus on ways engineering instructors who assign writing can ensure women’s contributions are both visible and valued in evaluation.",,[],,"[{""id"": 43662, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Moving engineering education research into practice is a more complicated task than it might initially seem. There are many significant barriers to hinder the transition from research to implementation. These barriers can be categorized into two groups: (1) individual barriers, such as personality characteristics that contribute to a lack of willingness to implement innovations, as well as a lack of knowledge about engineering education research; and (2) environmental perceptions, such as perceptions of the tenure and promotion process that suggest a lack of support for innovations. The project discussed in this paper investigates the characteristics of faculty members who successfully adopt engineering education innovations and studies the impact of their working environment on their decision to adopt. Additionally, the project investigates characteristics of faculty members who do not adopt engineering education innovations and whether that decision was affected by perceptions of their working environment. This paper describes preliminary results of a data collection effort identifying current barriers faculty members have in the adoption of innovations in engineering education. This paper presents data from two perspectives, that of self and colleagues. These perspectives are part of a larger 360° approach for data collection that also includes the perspectives of students, experts in education innovation - such as the director of a center for teaching and learning, administrators, and published documents. This 360° approach provides a foundation for bridging the gap, often referred to as the 'valley of death,' between engineering education research and the common practice of engineering education.",,[],http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/construct_facpubs/18,"[{""id"": 43878, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2012/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The study was done in the Fall semester of 2017 and involved 296 students in total, 149 using the publisher’s text and 147 using an OER text prepared especially for the course from a number of open resources. The goal in this initial study was to establish whether there was a significant difference in the outcomes between the two sections, and whether students preferred/did not prefer the OER text to a regular published text. The statistical results were tabulated by my colleague, Rob Nyland, and are published in the body of the paper. In addition to examining student responses to the survey, we also compared outcomes from the section of the Art 100 course that used the OER textbook with another section of the course, taught by the same instructor that used a traditional textbook (using McGraw Hill Connect). The mean grade in the section that used a traditional section was 86.9%, which was slightly higher than the mean grade for the OER section (84.9%), however the results of a Welch Two Sample t-test indicate that the differences were not significant (t = 1.011, p = .3129).

During the process ofthis transformation, section size and the instructor pool remained relatively constant; however,profound changes were made across all sections in terms of homework, timing of course content, gradecomputation, pedagogy, exam content and more.The motivation for focusing on Calculus I arose from a five-year National Science Foundation ScienceTalent Expansion Program grant that was awarded in 2010 to a multi-disciplinary team that spannedengineering, mathematics and science. A major grant objective was to raise first-semester, full-timeretention of students in STEM majors. The projects supported several year-long faculty learningcommunities (FLCs) of about 10 instructors each. With significant involvement from mathematicsfaculty, these FLCs first laid the groundwork for pedagogical reform of calculus. In 2013-14, an FLC wascreated with the express purpose of implementing consistent, student-learning focused strategiesacross several section of calculus. This experience facilitated buy-in and rapid communication andfeedback between instructors, resulting in significant agreement about intended course outcomes,grading, pedagogy and more. In subsequent semesters, all calculus instructors have “opted in” to thecommon, coherent approach to the course.

FAR,45037,111632553,111632553,A certificateless one-way group key agreement protocol for end-to-end email encryption,2018.0,,,,,"Over the years, email has evolved into one of the most widely used communication channels for both individuals and organizations. However, despite near ubiquitous use in much of the world, current information technology standards do not place emphasis on email security. Not until recently, webmail services such as Yahoo’s mail and Google’s gmail started to encrypt emails for privacy protection. However, the encrypted emails will be decrypted and stored in the service provider’s servers. If the servers are malicious or compromised, all the stored emails can be read, copied and altered. Thus, there is a strong need for end-to-end (E2E) email encryption to protect email user’s privacy. In this paper, we present a certificateless one-way group key agreement protocol with the following features, which are suitable to implement E2E email encryption: (1) certificateless and thus there is no key escrow problem and no public key certificate infrastructure is required; (2) one-way group key agreement and thus no back-and-forth message exchange is required; and (3) n-party group key agreement (not just 2- or 3-party). This paper also provides a security proof for the proposed protocol using “proof by simulation”. Finally, efficiency analysis of the protocol is presented at the end of the paper.",,[],,"[{""id"": 45037, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Many of the patterns in rating datasets reflect important real-world differences between the various users and items in the data; other patterns may be irrelevant or possibly undesirable for social or ethical reasons, particularly if they reflect undesired discrimination, such as discrimination in publishing or purchasing against authors who are women or ethnic minorities. In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to a dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly-available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. We find that common collaborative filtering algorithms differ in the gender distribution of their recommendation lists, and in the relationship of that output distribution to user profile distribution.",,[],https://md.ekstrandom.net/pubs/book-author-gender,"[{""id"": 45039, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The need for this support was a result of both Boise State University College of Engineering’s transition from a 2-year pre-engineering program to the establishment of Bachelors of Science in Engineering Degree programs in 1997 as well as the establishment of the College of Western Idaho as a regional community college in 2007. Both of these factors led to an increase in the numbers of incoming engineering students transferring from other institutions of higher education to complete their degree. These students were generally ineligible for most Boise State University scholarship programs which are mainly aimed toward students entering college directly from high school. In this paper we describe how our program connected transfer students with university staff, faculty and resources. To date, this program has a 100% retention rate, with the exception of one student on an official leave of absence, and a projected 100% graduation rate with 91% of the students already graduated.

FAR,45964,111643741,111643741,PHOSPHORYLATION AND CYTOPLASMIC TRANSLOCATION OF TDP-43 IN RESPONSE TO A NEUROTOXIC FRAGMENT OF APOLIPOPROTEIN E4 (APOE4): A MECHANISM THAT MAY UNDERLIE LOSS OF COGNITION IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE RELATED DEMENTIAS (ADRD),,,,,,"We have discovered that when a fragment of the protein ApoE4 (apolipoprotein E-epison-4) is applied to cultured human neurons, a protein named TDP-43 (transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa) is modified (a phosphate group is added to it) and moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (the main region of the neuron, that surrounds the nucleus). This effect is associated with a toxic effect of the ApoE4 fragment on the neurons. This is important because ApoE4 and TDP-43 have previously been implicated in dementia resulting from Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, stroke, AIDs, and traumatic brain injury, but the details of how these proteins participate in the death of brain neurons is not understood. We are performing preclinical research in neuroscience and we are presenting our research on this subject for the first time. Our findings suggest that ApoE4 and TDP-43 are involved in a common pathway that leads to loss of the neurons in the brain leading to defects in memory and cognition (thinking properly). Our work is novel and has the potential to link recent observations by other researchers into a framework for better understanding neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury. ApoE is a protein previously implicated in transporting cholesterol and other substances to the tissues and organs. Every person has two copies of the ApoE gene (one copy is inherited from each parent) but the copies may not be identical as there are 3 different types of ApoE (named ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4). ApoE3 is most common and most people have two copies of the ApoE3 gene. Unfortunately, people that inherit the ApoE4 gene are more likely to develop dementia from Alzheimer’s Disease or from other causes, than people with ApoE3. Previous research has shown that ApoE4 is cut into fragments within the brain, and one fragment of ApoE4 is toxic to neurons, but the mechanism of toxicity has not been established. Modification and movement of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm was first implicated in loss of muscle control in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, recent results show that TDP-43 is also modified and cytoplasmic in brain sections, obtained post-mortem, from people with dementia, and the extent of TDP-43 modification correlates with the severity of the dementia. Our experiments use human neurons produced from stem cells that are derived from skin cells (human embryos are not used to produce the stem cells). We culture the neurons in clear plastic dishes (up to 384 wells per dish) and we quantify the results by photographing the neurons with digital cameras attached to robotic microscopes. About 5 million people in the USA have dementia and these numbers will rise in the future as the population grows and people live longer. There is no known cure and the burden to society is enormous (about $277 billion per year is spent in the USA to take care of people with dementia as reported by CBS news). Our methods can be used to test thousands of drug candidates per week, and will accelerate the discovery of new medicines for dementia.",,[],,"[{""id"": 45964, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 45964, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 45964, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2021/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 45964, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2020/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 45964, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

In order to increase interoperability, real-time availability of data, and flexibility, information/communication technologies are adopted in this domain. While these information technologies have been effective, they are integrated into operational technologies without the necessary security defense. Designing an effective, layered security defense is not possible unless security threats are identified through a structural analysis of the ICS. For that reason, this paper provides an attacker's point of view on the reconnaissance effort necessary to gather details of the system dynamics - which are required for the development of sophisticated attacks. We present a reconnaissance approach which uses the system's I/O data to infer the dynamic model of the system. In this effort, we propose a novel cyber-attack which targets the controller proportional-integral-derivative gain values in a constant setpoint control system. Our findings will help researchers design more secure control systems.",,[],,"[{""id"": 46477, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

However, the speech transcription process has historically been laborious, expensive, and slow. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) tools have matured a great deal in the last decade and may be a suitable method to generate large scale, high quality transcriptions. These tools are are fast and economical, but generally produce errors at a much greater rate than human transcribers. It is unknown whether these errors matter when conducting psycholinguistic research. In this study, we will investigate the accuracy of earnings conference call transcripts produced by multiple tools and the impact of that transcription accuracy on the results of subsequent text mining analysis. While prior studies have focused on a single form of text mining, we will conduct three types of text analysis: bag-of-words based classification, lexicon-based classification and sentiment analysis. The results will show whether a different level of transcription quality is required for different types of text mining and the feasibility of using automated transcription services across a range of text mining applications.",,[],,

While valuable, the current state-of-the-art mostly are designed to protect the enterprise/ organizational privacy requirements and leave the main actor, i.e., the user, un-involved or with the limited ability to have control over his/her information sharing practices. In order to overcome these limitations, algorithms and tools that provide a user-centric privacy management system to individuals with different privacy concerns are required to take into the consideration the dynamic nature of privacy policies which are constantly changing based on the information sharing context and environmental variables. This paper extends the concept of contextual integrity to provide mathematical models and algorithms that enables the creations and management of privacy norms for individual users. The extension includes the augmentation of environmental variables, i.e. time, date, etc. as part of the privacy norms, while introducing an abstraction and a partial relation over information attributes. Further, a formal verification technique is proposed to ensure privacy norms are enforced for each information sharing action.",,[],https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3331076.3331105,"[{""id"": 46786, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,47513,111728000,111728000,Cyber-Physical Systems Security Introductory Course for STEM Students,2020.0,,,,,"We are witnessing the rapid development and adoption of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). CPS refers to the integration of digital and internetworked components, and physical devices in systems that affect nearly everyone in society. These devices are always connected to the internet. This wireless connectivity gives CPS devices the capability to be in continuously monitoring mode where data and information are delivered to device owner through a proxy server. This opens up all kinds of security issues for a device that has been built with features with little security considerations. At present, many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) graduates are not fully comprehending the security impact of device connectivity. STEM students are graduating without awareness of cybersecurity or cyber-physical systems security issues/challenges and not being aware of the security issues related to algorithms or systems they are designing. It is because the security awareness is not part of the current curriculum. In this paper, we highlight cybersecurity program at Boise State University that includes an introductory class on CPS security. Some topics included in this course are information technology versus operation technology, cryptography, industrial control system, smart grid, CAN bus, risk assessment, red versus blue team, and Kali Linux. In this paper, we provide examples on how students’ knowledge of CPS security changes over the course of the program, how students are supported in and out of their classroom in advancing their knowledge in this field.

Technostress reduces employee performance, engagement and satisfaction, but how does it affect business students? Although emotional intelligence has profound effects on student outcomes, its relationship with technostress and IT mindfulness is unexplored. Instructors cannot design effective theoretically-based interventions without understanding the underlying problems that students are experiencing. To address this gap, this paper reviews current literature on these concepts and presents a research model to explore the effects of these relationships in business students taking the Introduction to MIS course. The proposed study will build on the existing model of IT mindfulness and technostress in order to explain the role of emotional self-control in the research model and to test which factors have the most significant effects on students.

FAR,47925,111632553,111632553,A Practical and Secure Stateless Order Preserving Encryption for Outsourced Databases,2021.0,,,,,"Order-preserving encryption (OPE) plays an important role in securing outsourced databases. OPE schemes can be either Stateless or Stateful. Stateful schemes can achieve the ideal security of order-preserving encryption, i.e., ”reveal no information about the plaintexts besides order.” However, comparing to stateless schemes, stateful schemes require maintaining some state information locally besides encryption keys and the ciphertexts are mutable. On the other hand, stateless schemes only require remembering encryption keys and thus is more efficient. It is a common belief that stateless schemes cannot provide the same level of security as stateful ones because stateless schemes reveal the relative distance among their corresponding plaintext. In real world applications, such security defects may lead to the leakage of statistical and sensitive information, e.g., the data distribution, or even negates the whole encryption. In this paper, we propose a practical and secure stateless order-preserving encryption scheme. With prior knowledge of the data to be encrypted, our scheme can achieve IND-CCPA INDistinguishability under Committed ordered Chosen Plaintext Attacks) security for static data set. Though the IND-CCPA security can’t be met for dynamic data set, our new scheme can still significantly improve the security in real world applications. Along with the encryption scheme, in this paper we also provide methods to eliminate access pattern leakage in communications and thus prevents some common attacks to OPE schemes in practice.",,[],,"[{""id"": 47925, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This surface can be assessed quantitatively using a number of statistical methods, typically granting a single-value measure of approximate roughness and, by extension, an approximate degree of weathering. In recent years the techniques developed by electrical and signal engineers for analyzing signals have been applied to this surface roughness characterization. Seven core samples of limestone rock were scanned and converted into linear profiles along the surface of the rock samples. The signal energy (Es) and Z2, two single-value roughness measures, were calculated from these samples and Fourier and wavelet transforms were applied as well. The wavelet coefficients were then averaged, yielding a third single-value roughness measure. All three single-value roughness measures demonstrate remarkable agreement with one another with the exception of Z2, which estimates the roughness of one profile as slightly higher than two other profiles. This inconsistency appears to be due to an atypically high frequency content in that profile, exaggerating the measure of Z2. The wavelet transform technique proves to be very effective at locating sharp discontinuities along a rock at both low and high frequencies, promising better generalization to broader types of samples.",,[],,"[{""id"": 47958, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

In order to increase interoperability, real-time availability of data, and flexibility, information/communication technologies are adopted in this domain. While these information technologies have been effective, they are integrated into operational technologies without the necessary security defense. Designing an effective, layered security defense is not possible unless security threats are identified through a structural analysis of the ICS. For that reason, this paper provides an attacker's point of view on the reconnaissance effort necessary to gather details of the system dynamics - which are required for the development of sophisticated attacks. We present a reconnaissance approach which uses the system's I/O data to infer the dynamic model of the system. In this effort, we propose a novel cyber-attack which targets the controller proportional-integral-derivative gain values in a constant setpoint control system. Our findings will help researchers design more secure control systems.",,[],,"[{""id"": 48629, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

To address issues related to self-efﬁcacy and teacher preparation, we started a formal program (IDoCode) that not only provides teacher training through the academic year, but also provides teachers the opportunity to obtain a Masters in STEM Education degree or a Graduate Certiﬁcate in Computer Science Teacher Endorsement. Through our program, we have shown that teachers feel more conﬁdent in their ability to teach computer science courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and the Java-based AP CS A, as well as leading the students in a capstone project. In this paper, we present a sustainable approach to make a cultural change in the landscape of Computer Science education in the state of Idaho. We discuss various factors including working with the State Board of Education, local software companies, the university, and other invested partners to help CS courses in high school count towards graduation.

The (omitted for review) integrates ethics and social justice in agile 1-credit ‘Courses’ to blend social and technical essentials that promotes a more inclusive culture, prepare students to work effectively on software development teams, and be advocates for cultural and institutional change in their future careers. We have developed and offered over four semesters, six 1-credit ‘Courses’ that address a variety of professional and technical topics including foundational values in computer science, navigating computer systems, version control systems, agile development, an introduction to database systems, and technical interviewing. The foundational values course helps students develop a framework for understanding issues of ethics and social justice in computer science, and students have the multiple opportunities to utilize this framework in future technically focused hatchery units and several traditional courses that are part of the required curriculum. A core focus of this involves accounting for and approaching an understanding of the experiences of women and members of underrepresented minority groups in computer science and those affected by the use of computer science products in society. Once this is accomplished it then becomes possible to guide students in identifying sustainable processes for addressing the lack of inclusion and social justice. Preliminary results suggest that many students orient to current societal norms, and have difficulty independently identifying loss of inclusivity and social justice. However, interventions we have developed provide students with tools and skills to identify and address these biases in the classroom and in near-transfer settings. We are using multiple methods of documenting and exploring the effects of these changes, including surveys, interviews with students and faculty, and social network analysis. Next steps on the project will involve exploring and implementing ways to build and sustain inclusive community through increasing collaboration among students in different years in the curriculum. Overall, this project illustrates the benefits of developing a curriculum that is both able to quickly respond to industry needs and current issues of bias in computer science, preparing students who are better prepared for industry, ethical practitioners, and capable of becoming advocates for inclusivity.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/32414,"[{""id"": 48772, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Following joining, elemental and phase composition across the braze and parent metal interface was characterized with optical microscopy and SEM with EDS. Baseline electrochemical testing was performed on each of the braze alloys in the fired and unfired condition. Additionally, metal-to-metal braze specimens were prepared in order to expose the braze interface to 0.6 M NaCl electrolyte where the free corrosion potential was monitored. Following exposure to the aggressive solution, the corrosion damage morphology was characterized to determine the mode of attack and likely initiation areas. The critical potential for localized corrosion initiation was also investigated for the braze alloys when connected galvanically to 316L samples to determine the impact of brazing on localized corrosion.

Clean energy adoption, which links both objectives, sits at the foreground of urban planning decisions. One of the many cities that is evaluating strategies for clean energy is Boise, Idaho, which is also one of the fastest-growing metropolitan centers in the country (Sharf, 2018). To understand residents’ perspectives on energy use and utilization of energy efficiency upgrades, a survey was developed in a consultative process with the City’s Public Works staff. Respondents were asked a series of questions designed to inform Boise’s Energy Future, the energy plan that was ultimately adopted by the City of Boise in April 2019. The survey was completed by 2,129 Boise city residents in January 2019. Results indicate widespread support for clean and renewable energy goals and concern for climate change among Boise residents. Clean/renewable energy and affordability of energy were the top energy priorities of survey respondents. Solar, geothermal, wind and hydropower sources were preferred over carbon-based energy. In addition, support for Boise’s clean/renewable energy goals exists across demographic groups and zip codes, despite higher income residents and females showing stronger support than others. This paper aims to advance the practice of consultative surveys and public engagement in city planning by outlining the planning needs, conditions, key options for evaluation, and measures taken in the case of Boise’s energy planning efforts.

The need for this support was a result of both Boise State University College of Engineering’s transition from a 2-year pre-engineering program to the establishment of Bachelors of Science in Engineering Degree programs in 1997 as well as the establishment of the College of Western Idaho as a regional community college in 2007. Both of these factors led to an increase in the numbers of incoming engineering students transferring from other institutions of higher education to complete their degree. These students were generally ineligible for most Boise State University scholarship programs which are mainly aimed toward students entering college directly from high school. In this paper we describe how our program connected transfer students with university staff, faculty and resources. To date, this program has a 100% retention rate, with the exception of one student on an official leave of absence, and a projected 100% graduation rate with 91% of the students already graduated. In addition, approximately 22% of scholarship graduates are pursuing graduate degrees",,[],https://peer.asee.org/25969,"[{""id"": 50003, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2016/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 50003, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2015/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"
FAR,50019,112132134,112132134,Work in Progress: Development of a General Education First-Year Design Course,2020.0,,,,,"We discuss in this Work in Progress paper the development of a new first-year engineering course at Boise State University. ENGR 180 Communication in Design Thinking, was developed in order to emphasize the importance of communication throughout the design process. Communication with the client at the start of the design process occurs in order to understand the problem to be solved. The team and other stakeholders continuously communicate in order to work toward developing a prototype to solve the problem. The ability to effectively communicate is equally as important to the design of the final product. The development of ENGR 180 emphasizes this skill by encouraging students to work in trans-disciplinary teams. Students in majors across the University are welcome to learn about the significant role communication plays in the design process because ENGR 180 has no prerequisites. This provides each student opportunities to diversify their thought process as a result. Boise State University has not offered a course that focuses on communication during the design process. Various projects and in-class activities are utilized in ENGR 180 to emphasize the importance of communication as an engineer. The first project requires students to develop a prototype and procedure used to effectively communicate and train volunteers to assemble as many cookie sandwiches in ten minutes. Student teams develop specifications as a form of quality control, used to determine the success of their procedures. The second project focuses on empathy and the importance of adaptability in the design of everyday household items through human-centered design. Student teams choose between developing a device to support an individual button and zip their clothes or a cutting board for an individual who has use of one arm. These projects guide students through the design process, allowing them to test their prototype, analyze the results, and reiterate their prototype. Summative assessment of projects included reports and presentations. The first project has students analyze how successfully they communicated their procedures. The report reflects on how many successful cookie sandwiches were produced compared to the amount of unsuccessful cookie sandwiches produced. The presentation of the project serves as a way to share with the class each team’s approach and to analyze what aspects of communication were most effective. Multiple presentations were included for the second, adaptive project. These presentations included student teams sharing their concept designs of the adaptive device. The purpose of this presentation is for students to analyze the schedule, budget, and audience feedback for each concept design in order to help guide them towards the design to prototype. Other presentations include the initial and final iteration of their prototype. Written deliverables throughout the seven week long project were used to guide students through the design process and to allow them to reflect on the project. Other in-class activities included assignments related to ethics, sustainability, and empathy. We have performed a mid-semester assessment in order to understand how students are receiving the course. Students overall have been happy with the hands-on activities that relate to the real world and find them to be engaging. The projects created for this course allows the students to experience the design process, which they have found to be very beneficial. The formative and summative assessments throughout this initial semester offering indicate that students are becoming more aware of the important role that communication plays in design. Our analysis of this course’s impact is becoming more clear as this initial semester offering progresses and we are able to implement changes that improve the students’ overall experience. We present in this paper a summary of student reflection of the importance of communication in design, as well as the design process itself.",,[],https://dx.doi.org/10.18260/1-2--35627,"[{""id"": 50019, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The (omitted for review) integrates ethics and social justice in agile 1-credit ‘Courses’ to blend social and technical essentials that promotes a more inclusive culture, prepare students to work effectively on software development teams, and be advocates for cultural and institutional change in their future careers. We have developed and offered over four semesters, six 1-credit ‘Courses’ that address a variety of professional and technical topics including foundational values in computer science, navigating computer systems, version control systems, agile development, an introduction to database systems, and technical interviewing. The foundational values course helps students develop a framework for understanding issues of ethics and social justice in computer science, and students have the multiple opportunities to utilize this framework in future technically focused hatchery units and several traditional courses that are part of the required curriculum. A core focus of this involves accounting for and approaching an understanding of the experiences of women and members of underrepresented minority groups in computer science and those affected by the use of computer science products in society. Once this is accomplished it then becomes possible to guide students in identifying sustainable processes for addressing the lack of inclusion and social justice. Preliminary results suggest that many students orient to current societal norms, and have difficulty independently identifying loss of inclusivity and social justice. However, interventions we have developed provide students with tools and skills to identify and address these biases in the classroom and in near-transfer settings. We are using multiple methods of documenting and exploring the effects of these changes, including surveys, interviews with students and faculty, and social network analysis. Next steps on the project will involve exploring and implementing ways to build and sustain inclusive community through increasing collaboration among students in different years in the curriculum. Overall, this project illustrates the benefits of developing a curriculum that is both able to quickly respond to industry needs and current issues of bias in computer science, preparing students who are better prepared for industry, ethical practitioners, and capable of becoming advocates for inclusivity.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/32414,"[{""id"": 50159, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This activity is designed to overcome the difficulty of reliably developing soft skills in the classroom. Soft skills (e.g. empathy, emotional intelligence, communication, conflict resolution) are complex, developed through practice, and involve ambiguity, and are highly sought-after in industry. Based on the teaching principles of adult learning theory (andragogy), we illustrate how the role play approach can enhance learning in the IT project management course.

Abstract: This workshop involves attendees to demonstrate models, tools, and methods used to guide undergraduate computer science (CS) students to identify and propose systemic solutions for inclusion, diversity and social justice problems that occur in CS education, professions, and products. This is based on systemic theories of justice, and practices of organizational change. Students identify this as valuable and also indicate they would welcome more of the same in future CS courses. Learning Objectives: Attendees will be able to: 1. name and describe principal barriers to inclusion that exist in undergraduate STEM-oriented classrooms. 2. name and describe elements of theories of justice and processes of organizational change that can be used to address issues of inclusion, diversity, and justice in STEM-oriented classrooms and professional practice. 3. analyze and suggest systemic solutions to address issues of inclusion, diversity, and justice in STEM-oriented classrooms and professional practice. Description: Introduction: Within the context of an NSF-funded RED project (Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments) focused on replicating the best elements of a successful technology company within undergraduate higher education (our ""CSP-Hatchery""), we have embedded a set of 1-credit courses within the normal curricula. These courses include electives addressing currently emerging technical skills required by industry, and also include a focus on responding to corporate interests in improving inclusion, diversity, and justice in STEM education (particularly, computer science) and technology work and as influenced by technologies in society. This workshop focuses on theory, methods, media, and classroom management of a 1-credit course in ""Foundational Values"" required of all incoming students in the Computer Science (CS) undergraduate degree at Boise State University. The presenter is the designer and faculty lead on delivery of this course. This workshop provides a multi-perspective view on this course. First, it reviews the instructional technology underpinning its design and delivery, including learner analysis and selection of media and methods. Second, it involves the audience in a demonstration of the principal activity used in the course. Third, in the process of this interactive demonstration, it provides meta-analytic perspectives that guide instructional methods as they often play out in the course with different kinds of students. In this way, this workshop provides timely and relevant information for immediate application by attendees. Attendees at this workshop will receive a complete lesson plan and instructional materials for the activity addressed. Finally, this workshop will report student outcomes compiled from three consecutive years of delivery of this course. The Problem: Social science and a growing archive of literature and activism provides substantial resources for those aiming to address gaps in knowledge and understanding related to injustices in our society. However, those injustices persist and may even be expanding in scope and depth as we discover more about physical, administrative, technical, and personal practices reflect and enforce biases. As educators of undergraduate students, we are severely challenged to address structural changes across the whole span of events, but we are perfectly positioned to help our students develop perspectives and skills that can help them address some of these issues no matter where they find themselves. This possibility nominates each of us as part of a system of beneficial change. Because we are part of the system of higher education we can take advantage of other efforts in our schools, colleges, and universities, and add curricula that channels those other efforts to make them especially powerful for our students in their technical and future vocational pursuits. Those other efforts often come from departments in other colleges -- sociology, history, philosophy, and others -- with courses that document and analyze social problems and provide strong theory and advice on how to address those problems. There are also progressive efforts to address issues related to ""algorithmic bias,"" structural access/inaccess to technologies, and more within the fields of computer science and engineering, but they are -- so far -- not a part of the central curricular and professional focus, and they remain mostly isolated in individual elective courses without systemic influence. Additionally, however powerful they may be, curricula in other academic departments may not focus on specific phenomena they believe to be relevant in their technical pursuits, or which meet our students ""where they are"" in their lives. While some students reflect a general acceptance of these societal problems, they don't often see a path that links this to their chosen technical career, especially when their course curricula put a nearly exclusive focus on technical knowledge and skills. These are the individuals who justify inaction on the point that ""it's not my problem."" Other students tell us that these courses are explicitly not relevant to them or that they only serve to bolster the university's perceived role to ""indoctrinate them"" into a particular social agenda or political viewpoint. These individuals point to the nearly entirely technical curricula before them to justify that anything other than technical knowledge and skill is irrelevant, or stand on an already-existing and strongly held belief -- bolstered in phenomena reported in the popular press -- that a worldview of inclusion, diversity, and justice is (to them) actually a worldview that explicitly hurts them. All of these viewpoints also reflect a couplet of facts which underpin the whole of all issues related to inclusion, diversity, and justice in our society -- the majority of individuals who enter our classrooms and who populate technology workplaces are white or Asian males, and the majority of instances where inclusion, diversity, and justice are lost in our society involve individuals who are underrepresented in our classrooms and in workplaces are not members of these groups. This means the people we are attempting to guide may not have personal experiences of systemic and persistent loss of inclusion, diversity, and justice. This inexperience allows the majority to deny that such issues exist because they have not felt them. In other words, we as educators face multiple sources and sorts of resistance, possibly grounded in gaps in experiences, to efforts aiming to address these issues. This points to a need to reduce resistance to change at the same time -- or even before -- we might begin more dedicated moves toward making change. It also alludes to possible instructional methods we can use to provide some level of experience that highlights the authenticity of these problems, and which in turn can open the door to action. To review, in all of the identified sorts of resistance suggested above, two things stand out. First, each of them starts with a pre-existing attitude that our efforts are (a) beside the point, (b) irrelevant, or even (c) a danger to their success in a technical career. Second, each of them can be seen to be related to a lack of relevant personal experience with the issues. Constraints, Resources, and our Intervention: It will not be a surprise to note additional difficulties encountered with attempts to add new content and courses to an existing undergraduate degree in CS. Within our RED project we modified the existing undergraduate curricula to require a flexible set of 5, 1-credit ""Hatchery unit"" courses in every student's degree plan. One of these courses, CS-HU 130 ""Foundational Values,"" is required of every incoming student. This course is restricted to only 12.5 contact hours across 5 weeks and 10, 75 minute sessions. Since the project began in 2017 enrollment in this course had been capped at 30. After moving the course to an online format for Fall 2020 and in response to strong demand due to COVID-19, we have raised the cap to 50. Review of related literature and interviews with industry representatives indicated that all software development companies organize their personnel in teams -- there are effectively no instances where sole-developers complete a commercial project of any size. This points to the use of teamwork in the course process so we can leverage that experience as an early step toward the Hatchery goals overall. workshop reports on and engages attendees Severe restrictions on time -- a 1-credit, 5-week course (12.5 contact hours) Dale's cone of experience -- vicarious experiences through case studies Framed from the standpoint of how skills in addressing IDJ problems can improve their chances of success (teamwork, reproducible rubrics, repeated and varied practice)",,[],,"[{""id"": 51307, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

Hence, prior to Matthew, the area had gradually become regarded by locals as “immune” to major landfalling hurricanes, as any storms at that latitude generally curved away from Jacksonville and headed north to strike the Carolinas. Additionally, a major beach nourishment project for the beaches of Duval County (Mayport, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Jacksonville Beach) had been initiated in 1978, with periodic renourishment every 6-8 years thereafter, and was responsible for a general lack of beachfront damage in Duval County from Matthew and Irma. Unfortunately, Vilano Beach, 35 km to the south in St. Johns County, twice made national headlines with severe beach and dune erosion, destruction of residences, and significant infrastructure damage that was inflicted by both storms. However, it is important to note that for several decades prior to 2016, Vilano Beach had been experiencing steady, yet chronic beach erosion, and was already in a highly vulnerable state in many places when the recent storms struck. The cause of the ongoing background erosion prior to the recent storms is a source of contention among residents and some experts. Some blame dredging of the large ebb shoal of St. Augustine Inlet (immediately to the south of Vilano Beach) that occurred between 2001 and 2005, whereas others blame a combination of sea level rise and persistent tropical storms and Nor’easters for the ongoing shoreline retreat. Regardless of the cause(s) of the historic erosion, reaction of many beachfront homeowners to Matthew was to immediately build sheet pile sea walls, many of which were poorly conceived and inadequately designed. When Irma struck the following year, not only did many of these seawalls fail to perform as anticipated, they generally exacerbated erosion to any unprotected adjacent properties. Understanding the extent of prior damages, the contributions of both natural and anthropogenic activity, and estimating future damages to Vilano Beach are especially important because a major roadway, Coastal Highway A1A, serves as the only access to the communities along 28 km of coastline north of the city of St. Augustine, as well as an evacuation route. Ironically, in many locations the only protection afforded A1A is by threatened houses and the (mostly) poorly conceived sheet pile seawalls installed by their desperate owners.",,[],https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784483688.003,"[{""id"": 51352, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 51352, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/01"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}]"

This environmentally friendly technique is a bio-geo-chemical process where microbes play a key role in increasing soil strength through precipitating calcium carbonate. Past studies at Boise State University have indicated that MICP via bio-stimulation could be a viable alternative for expansive clayey soil treatments. However, these studies raised a new question about the relationship between soil composition, urease activity, and calcite precipitation. To answer this question, batch studies were conducted using autoclaved-sterilized sand mixed with different percentages of non-sterile natural clay and tested for urease activity. Moreover, to investigate the difference in urease activity between sand and clay bacterial communities, experiments were repeated on samples with different amounts of non-sterile sand and autoclaved-sterilized clay. MICP-treated clay/sand mixes were then evaluated for calcite precipitation. Our results showed that soil mixes with higher clay content have more urease activity and higher levels of calcite precipitation for both sand-autoclaved and clay-autoclaved soil mixes. Test results indicate that urease activity could potentially be used as an indicator of MICP performance in different soil compositions.",,[],,"[{""id"": 51358, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2020/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

With a plethora of initiatives emerging in the past few years to attract more individuals to careers in construction, a question has arisen as to whether the initiatives reach an audience outside of those who would go to work in construction anyway. This project sought to develop an intervention that would expose a broader audience to construction topics, and related careers in construction, through a course in a construction higher education program. Students in the construction higher education program created lesson plans that would be employed in public school classrooms and fit in the required curriculum, thereby reaching all students and not just those already included toward a career in construction.

FAR,53012,111671285,111671285,Judges as Arbiters of GAAP: The Case of Asset Impairment Recognition,2020.0,,,,,"I examine the role of federal judges in interpreting GAAP in the context of class action securities litigation. I focus on a series of cases dealing with asset impairment recognition involving SFAS 121 and SFAS 144. The cases present a unique natural experiment. Early cases uniformly favored managers until one prominent case reversed this trend, holding managers liable for a delay in writing down impaired assets. Later, in a different case involving the same defendant in the same court, the court swung back in the other direction, ruling in favor of the managers under similar facts. The result is an overall body of law that favors manager discretion with respect to impairment recognition, but with an intervening window of time where the law favored plaintiffs and potentially made it easier to hold managers liable for delayed asset write-downs. I use this window to test whether managers and financial statement preparers pay attention to the content of judicial decisions and adjust their behavior accordingly.

FAR,53855,112045153,112045153,Work in Progress: Development of a General Education First-Year Design Course,2020.0,,,,,"We discuss in this Work in Progress paper the development of a new first-year engineering course at Boise State University. ENGR 180 Communication in Design Thinking, was developed in order to emphasize the importance of communication throughout the design process. Communication with the client at the start of the design process occurs in order to understand the problem to be solved. The team and other stakeholders continuously communicate in order to work toward developing a prototype to solve the problem. The ability to effectively communicate is equally as important to the design of the final product. The development of ENGR 180 emphasizes this skill by encouraging students to work in trans-disciplinary teams. Students in majors across the University are welcome to learn about the significant role communication plays in the design process because ENGR 180 has no prerequisites. This provides each student opportunities to diversify their thought process as a result. Boise State University has not offered a course that focuses on communication during the design process. Various projects and in-class activities are utilized in ENGR 180 to emphasize the importance of communication as an engineer. The first project requires students to develop a prototype and procedure used to effectively communicate and train volunteers to assemble as many cookie sandwiches in ten minutes. Student teams develop specifications as a form of quality control, used to determine the success of their procedures. The second project focuses on empathy and the importance of adaptability in the design of everyday household items through human-centered design. Student teams choose between developing a device to support an individual button and zip their clothes or a cutting board for an individual who has use of one arm. These projects guide students through the design process, allowing them to test their prototype, analyze the results, and reiterate their prototype. Summative assessment of projects included reports and presentations. The first project has students analyze how successfully they communicated their procedures. The report reflects on how many successful cookie sandwiches were produced compared to the amount of unsuccessful cookie sandwiches produced. The presentation of the project serves as a way to share with the class each team’s approach and to analyze what aspects of communication were most effective. Multiple presentations were included for the second, adaptive project. These presentations included student teams sharing their concept designs of the adaptive device. The purpose of this presentation is for students to analyze the schedule, budget, and audience feedback for each concept design in order to help guide them towards the design to prototype. Other presentations include the initial and final iteration of their prototype. Written deliverables throughout the seven week long project were used to guide students through the design process and to allow them to reflect on the project. Other in-class activities included assignments related to ethics, sustainability, and empathy. We have performed a mid-semester assessment in order to understand how students are receiving the course. Students overall have been happy with the hands-on activities that relate to the real world and find them to be engaging. The projects created for this course allows the students to experience the design process, which they have found to be very beneficial. The formative and summative assessments throughout this initial semester offering indicate that students are becoming more aware of the important role that communication plays in design. Our analysis of this course’s impact is becoming more clear as this initial semester offering progresses and we are able to implement changes that improve the students’ overall experience. We present in this paper a summary of student reflection of the importance of communication in design, as well as the design process itself.",,[],https://dx.doi.org/10.18260/1-2--35627,"[{""id"": 53855, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The goal of TBL is to “provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge in the classroom to solve problems rather than just covering content.” Based on the performance of the students in the course taught with TBL, we found that TBL had a statistically significant impact on student performance in 2 of the 5 programming assignments. Additionally, the end-of-semester student survey indicated that 88% of the students said that the team-based learning activities helped them understand the material better. Students mentioned that they felt like they belonged in Computer Science (fostering a sense of community in large classrooms) and frequently studied with some of their team members for the course assignments. Compared to a previous offering of the course that was purely lecture-based, the class as a whole received higher final grades and performed better on all of the programming assignments.

FAR,54810,111110582,111110582,Calculus Reform - Increasing STEM Retention and Post-Requisite Course Success While Closing the Retention Gap for Women and Underrepresented Minority,2017.0,American Society for Engineering Education,,,,"Boise State University (BSU) implemented an across-the-board reform of calculus instruction during the 2014 calendar year. The details of the reform, described elsewhere (Bullock, 2015), (Bullock 2016), involve both pedagogical and curricular reform. Gains from the project have included a jump in Calculus I pass rate, greater student engagement, greater instructor satisfaction, a shift toward active learning pedagogies, and the emergence of a strong collaborative teaching community. This paper examines the effects of the reform on student retention. Since the curricular reform involved pruning some content and altering course outcomes, which could conceivably have negative downstream impacts, we report on student success in post-requisite mathematics and engineering coursework. To explore the effects of the Calculus reform on retention we focused on whether or not students are retained at the university immediately subsequent to the year in which they encounter Calculus I. We divided 3002 student records into two groups: those who encountered the new version of Calculus and those who had the traditional experience. We then compared retention rates for the two groups. We found that the new Calculus course improved retention (relative to the old) by 3.4 percentage points; a modest, but statistically significant (p = 0.020) result. University retention rates for women, under-represented minorities (URM), and Pell-eligible students were also computed. All three subgroups showed gains, with URM leading with 6.3 percentage points of improved retention (p = 0.107). We then considered retention within STEM as a measure of how the Calculus reform influenced students. For the same groups of students, we computed the rate at which STEM majors were retained in STEM. Once again we found a modest overall gain of 3.3 percentage points (p = .078). We found strong effects on women and underrepresented minorities (URM). The new Calculus course improved retention for both of these groups by more than 9 percentage points, a large effect. At this university, under the old Calculus, women used to lag men in STEM retention by about 8 percentage points. After the Calculus reform this gap nearly vanished, shrinking to 0.5 percentage points. Under the old Calculus, STEM retention of URM students used to lag that of non-URM. After the Calculus reform the gap flipped, so that underrepresented minority students are now retained in STEM at higher rates than non-URM. As a final result we examined student success in courses that typically follow Calculus I. Here the metric is pass rate, and we compared pass rates between the students who took the new Calculus against those who took the old. For additional comparison we also included students who transferred into post-Calculus course work. Once again the reformed Calculus course led to better results.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/28000,"[{""id"": 54810, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2017/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

During the process ofthis transformation, section size and the instructor pool remained relatively constant; however,profound changes were made across all sections in terms of homework, timing of course content, gradecomputation, pedagogy, exam content and more.The motivation for focusing on Calculus I arose from a five-year National Science Foundation ScienceTalent Expansion Program grant that was awarded in 2010 to a multi-disciplinary team that spannedengineering, mathematics and science. A major grant objective was to raise first-semester, full-timeretention of students in STEM majors. The projects supported several year-long faculty learningcommunities (FLCs) of about 10 instructors each. With significant involvement from mathematicsfaculty, these FLCs first laid the groundwork for pedagogical reform of calculus. In 2013-14, an FLC wascreated with the express purpose of implementing consistent, student-learning focused strategiesacross several section of calculus. This experience facilitated buy-in and rapid communication andfeedback between instructors, resulting in significant agreement about intended course outcomes,grading, pedagogy and more. In subsequent semesters, all calculus instructors have “opted in” to thecommon, coherent approach to the course.

In addition to their direct hazards, wildfires can also contribute to human and environmental health concerns due to secondary contamination, e.g., wildfire suppression such as aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) can release per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into the soil, which are very mobile, toxic, and persistent. Both direct seepage through the topsoil and biotransformation of fluorotelomers (FTs) determine the fate of PFAS in soils and aquifers. Research has indicated that phase partitioning behavior, such as sorption to soils and sediments, controls the fate and transport of chemicals in the environment According to various studies, the main soil or sediment characteristics that control PFAS’ sorption behavior include organic carbon (OC), pH, index cations, and ionic strength. However, neither OC, pH, nor claycontent alone could explain the sorption behavior of PFAS. More research is needed to help to understand the role of co-contaminants on the sorption behavior of PFAS, the role of surface charge on the sorption of PFAS, and on a wider range of PFAS chain compounds in the future. This paper aims to review the fate and transport of PFAS and identify the areas of research need.",,[],,"[{""id"": 57691, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The challenge is encouraging a thirst for learning within individuals and teams that develops greater self-awareness and empowers individuals to challenge the status quo. Accordingly, our experience as graduate students and L&D professionals inspired this research into ways metacognitive strategies can help exponentially improve learning outcomes. After reviewing the literature, the team found the topic appears to have received very little attention. This inspired our call to action. To better understand the topic, we initiated a collaborative autoethnographic analysis during the summer of 2021. The team interviewed each other to triangulate qualitative data and identify themes. This systematic approach helped us develop a conceptual framework for the Metacognitive Learning and Growth (MLG) model that emphasizes metacognition, mindset, and external factors such as organizational safety on personal growth. Our analysis of metacognitive experiences suggests L&D professionals can use the five-step MLG model to develop requisite skills that transform learning barriers into opportunities for investigation and professional growth.

FAR,59367,111112401,111112401,Schick-Ostolosa Granary Historical Reconstruction Project,2022.0,,,,,"Located in the foothills north of Boise, the Schick-Ostolasa Farmstead is the longest continuously inhabited home in the state of Idaho, being inhabited from the 1860s to 2005. In the mid-2000s the farm was slated for a residential development but an agreement was made with the developer to save the farmstead area for use as an agricultural living history site. Under the guidance of the Dry Creek Historical Society (DCHS), planning, fundraising, and restoration work began on several of the structures on the site. Today, the site covers 2 acres along Dry Creek, and includes a farmhouse and six historic farm buildings. The site has received several awards for the restoration work, and the farmstead is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In an effort to continue the restoration process, the first author agreed to assess and recommend a plan for the restoration of the collection of agricultural outbuildings on the Farmstead. After completion of the assessment, it was agreed that a three-chambered granary structure was in the greatest need of repair in that it looked like it might fall over or collapse, and probably the best candidate for restoration. The unique purpose and odd construction made the granary a great choice for restoration. In cooperation with the Boise State University Department of Construction Management (BSU CM) and the Boise State Construction Management Association (CMA) Student Organization, the restoration project was undertaken. Work began with a detailed inspection and photographing of the granary to document every architectural detail. A structural examination was undertaken to assess materials that could be reused, and how much would have to be replaced with similar modern equivalents. Working with multiple stakeholders, including the Idaho State Historical Society, a design, plan, estimate, and schedule were developed. The construction process began with the careful disassembly of the granary piece by piece, with each element numbered and stored nearby. An inconspicuous concrete foundation was placed and new railroad ties were set in place for the foundation. A skeleton of original and new wood components was built, and the building was then reclad with as many original pieces as possible to ensure that the original look of the structure was maintained. Work was then completed on the roof structure, that due to severe deterioration, had to be completely replaced. In the end, the Granary reconstruction project was a success, with the DCHS hosting a ribbon cutting and re-dedication ceremony, and the project was awarded an Excellence in Historic Preservation by the Idaho Historic Preservation Council. More importantly, the project gave students the opportunity to learn aspects of historical reconstruction and become stewards of the heritage of their community.",,[],https://www.chsa7thbiennialmeeting.org/,"[{""id"": 59367, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2021/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

This environmentally friendly technique is a bio-geo-chemical process where microbes play a key role in increasing soil strength through precipitating calcium carbonate. Past studies at Boise State University have indicated that MICP via bio-stimulation could be a viable alternative for expansive clayey soil treatments. However, these studies raised a new question about the relationship between soil composition, urease activity, and calcite precipitation. To answer this question, batch studies were conducted using autoclaved-sterilized sand mixed with different percentages of non-sterile natural clay and tested for urease activity. Moreover, to investigate the difference in urease activity between sand and clay bacterial communities, experiments were repeated on samples with different amounts of non-sterile sand and autoclaved-sterilized clay. MICP-treated clay/sand mixes were then evaluated for calcite precipitation. Our results showed that soil mixes with higher clay content have more urease activity and higher levels of calcite precipitation for both sand-autoclaved and clay-autoclaved soil mixes. Test results indicate that urease activity could potentially be used as an indicator of MICP performance in different soil compositions.",,[],,"[{""id"": 59874, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2020/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,59879,114001930,114001930,"Mapping and Characterization of Rockfall Runout Talus Deposits from Columnar Basalt Cliffs in Boise, ID",2022.0,American Rock Mechanics Association,,,,"Boise Idaho is located in the western portion of Snake River Plain which is commonly known as the Treasure Valley. This area contains the Boise-Nampa metropolitan area which includes five counties and eight cities and has approximately forty-two percent of the population of the state of Idaho. The near surface geology, viewed north-south in Boise, consists of eight well defined terraces above the current floodplain of the Boise River. The terraces were formed by the Boise River incising sediments deposited in ancestral Lake Idaho. After each downcutting event gravel terraces were deposited. Associated with some downcutting events are Pleistocene aged basalt flows. Two of the important flows are the Basalt of Lucky Peak (1.364 Ma) and Basalt of Gowan Terrace (0.572 Ma). The columnar basalts form vertical cliffs and over time rockfall events have formed talus deposits on the base of the cliffs. The rockfall runouts are in close proximity to a major highway and a river that is used for recreational activities such as kayaking and standup paddle boarding. This study presents the finding of mapping and characterization efforts of the rockfall runout talus deposits. The dimensions of runouts will be mapped using both measurements from Google Earth and photomosaic images developed from unmanned aerial vehicle flights. The sizes and size distributions of the rock blocks within the talus deposit will be determined using photogrammetry techniques from images developed from unmanned aerial vehicle flights and images obtained during ground truthing activities. By comparing the sizes of blocks within the talus deposit to the sizes of rock blocks within the basalt cliffs, we are hoping to determine if the rock blocks are damaged as they fall and become deposited within the talus.",,[],,"[{""id"": 59879, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,67383,111673752,111673752,Building a Communication-Integrated Curriculum in Materials Science,2023.0,,,,,"With the need to meet ABET outcomes around professional skills, such as communication and teamwork, engineering programs have long explored approaches to ensure their graduates are able to participate in the workplace in ways that employers demand. While approaches vary and success depends on a number of factors, research demonstrates that an integrated approach to professional skill development is the most impactful for student learning. How can an engineering program build an integrated approach that provides meaningful communication education? This paper shares the experiences from faculty in a material science and engineering program that has created an integrated approach to communication and is working toward creating a cohesive culture around communication and professional skill development. This program started small: one faculty member from technical communication was recruited to work with a faculty teaching junior- and senior-level project courses. The focus of the program was primarily on bolstering written skills, but in recent years has expanded to consider professional skills more broadly, including working on diverse teams and supporting equity and inclusion through writing and collaboration. The goal of this paper is to share where the program is currently and the next steps to expand efforts to continue to support student learning. Starting in 2022, the integrated communication education has been expanded to the sophomore lab to create a three-course sequence focused on communication and professional skill development. This scaffolding and multi-year focus allows faculty to build student confidence in their ability to work as technical professionals after they graduate. By the time undergraduates reach their senior capstone, they are more fully prepared to take on complex communication situations within challenging team projects. Future efforts focus on more consistently scaffolding writing throughout the full materials science program and engaging a larger set of faculty around these areas. The paper will share findings of how efforts have supported student learning and explore how faculty can address areas that still need support. Overall, this collaboration has not only allowed the materials science program to fully meet ABET outcomes but also understand the ways communication support enables graduates to develop engineering identities and move into the next phase with the skills they need to be successful.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/43050,"[{""id"": 67383, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
FAR,67384,111673752,111673752,Using Reflection to Facilitate Writing Knowledge Transfer in Upper-Level Materials Science Courses,2019.0,,,,,"In engineering, students rarely use a cohesive theory of writing to approach the writing situations they encounter in their engineering courses and internships. Instead, they fall back on the strategies they developed in high school or as first year college students in composition. These strategies sometimes work, but they may also lead student writers to ignore the new rhetorical situation they are engaging in, thus not always writing with an eye toward specific audiences, or with an awareness of how the different context brings with it different genres and conventions they must use to write successfully as engineers. In addition, even when terms and elements of writing process are introduced, they tend to revert back to the less successful strategies in their repertoire to complete writing tasks rather than revising their approaches to fit the demands of the engineering/scientific rhetorical situations. With an eye toward asking students to develop a engineering-specific theory of writing and nudging them into the novice status needed to learn how to address writing in a new context, we approached teaching junior- and senior-level materials science classes with two goals: 1.) asking students to engage in reflection throughout the semester to connect learning not only from prior classes, but across assignments, semesters, and years; and 2.) encouraging students to generate their own theory of writing that will help them address the demands of writing for engineering within school and beyond. This paper will report on what we (an English faculty member collaborating with a materials science and engineering faculty member) are doing to promote writing in the classes through reflection and feedback. We also explore how students might be taking that knowledge elsewhere, whether to another course or outside the university. Our aim is to bring together recent scholarship on transfer, writing pedagogy, and engineering education to explore how reflection can be used in an upper-level setting to extend students’ writing education and allow them to develop the tools they need to be successful engineers both in the classroom and beyond.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/33516,"[{""id"": 67384, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

As technologies have evolved that complement scRNAseq measurements with things like single-cell proteomic, epigenomic, and genomic information, it becomes increasingly apparent how much biology exists as a product of multimodal regulation. Biological processes such as transcription, translation, and post-translational or epigenetic modification impose both energetic and specific molecular demands on a cell and are therefore implicitly constrained by the metabolic state of the cell. While metabolomics is crucial for defining a holistic model of any biological process, the chemical heterogeneity of the metabolome makes it particularly difficult to measure, and technologies capable of doing this at single-cell resolution are far behind other multiomics modalities. To address these challenges, we present GEFMAP (Gene Expression-based Flux Mapping and Metabolic Pathway Prediction), a method based on geometric deep learning for predicting flux through reactions in a global metabolic network using transcriptomics data, which we ultimately apply to scRNAseq. GEFMAP leverages the natural graph structure of metabolic networks to learn both a biological objective for each cell and estimate a mass-balanced relative flux rate for each reaction in each cell using novel deep learning models.",,[],,"[{""id"": 68208, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 68208, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 68208, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]"

The literature is split on whether this language should be Python, Java, C# or something else. No matter the language, students in an IS major or minor can be resistant and unprepared to learn programming or any topic involving math skills (unlike those studying Computer Science or Engineering). Some researchers have investigated how to make the course more accessible for beginning students. Students' own resistance and lack of self-confidence can make teaching this course challenging. If student apprehensions are not managed, programming courses can directly lead to high rates of attrition from the IS major, particularly by underrepresented students who do not see themselves reflected in mainstream role models. We suggest that a new approach is needed to reach all IS students and to help them to both see the value of learning how to code in an object-oriented language and to connect that value to their individual sense of identity. We present an assignment used in an introduction to programming course that seeks to make individual and multi-faceted identities salient throughout the course by allowing students to work through these identities and to observe relevant connections to themselves in the course. This assignment was developed based on the instructor's research expertise in identity theory. This teaching approach has helped the instructor to build more relevant and engaging examples for students and to dynamically change assignments each semester.

FAR,69022,114046657,114046657,Using Reflection to Facilitate Writing Knowledge Transfer in Upper-Level Materials Science Courses,2019.0,,,,,"In engineering, students rarely use a cohesive theory of writing to approach the writing situations they encounter in their engineering courses and internships. Instead, they fall back on the strategies they developed in high school or as first year college students in composition. These strategies sometimes work, but they may also lead student writers to ignore the new rhetorical situation they are engaging in, thus not always writing with an eye toward specific audiences, or with an awareness of how the different context brings with it different genres and conventions they must use to write successfully as engineers. In addition, even when terms and elements of writing process are introduced, they tend to revert back to the less successful strategies in their repertoire to complete writing tasks rather than revising their approaches to fit the demands of the engineering/scientific rhetorical situations. With an eye toward asking students to develop a engineering-specific theory of writing and nudging them into the novice status needed to learn how to address writing in a new context, we approached teaching junior- and senior-level materials science classes with two goals: 1.) asking students to engage in reflection throughout the semester to connect learning not only from prior classes, but across assignments, semesters, and years; and 2.) encouraging students to generate their own theory of writing that will help them address the demands of writing for engineering within school and beyond. This paper will report on what we (an English faculty member collaborating with a materials science and engineering faculty member) are doing to promote writing in the classes through reflection and feedback. We also explore how students might be taking that knowledge elsewhere, whether to another course or outside the university. Our aim is to bring together recent scholarship on transfer, writing pedagogy, and engineering education to explore how reflection can be used in an upper-level setting to extend students’ writing education and allow them to develop the tools they need to be successful engineers both in the classroom and beyond.",,[],https://peer.asee.org/33516,"[{""id"": 69022, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This is especially true as perpetual technological innovation makes assuring the integrity and authenticity of data more challenging. However, current information technology standards place little emphasis on email encryption. CLOW-GKA (Certificateless One Way Group Key Agreement Scheme) is an email encryption system that eliminates the need for third party verification. The cryptosystem draws from such other schemes as Phil Zimmerman’s PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), Shamir’s ID-PKC (Identity Based Public Key Cryptosystem), and Al-Riyami’s CL-PKC (Certificateless PKC). This work is a continuous and a follow up effort to build a CLOW-GKA prototype by developing an accessible graphical user-interface (GUI) that implements CLOW-GKA.

This is motivated in part by settings such as single-cell RNA where the data is very high-dimensional, but its structure can be captured via an affinity graph. This allows us to utilize ideas from graph signal processing. In particular, we present algorithms for the cases where the signal is perturbed by Gaussian noise, dropout, and uniformly distributed noise. The signals are assumed to follow a prior distribution defined in the frequency domain which favors signals which are smooth across the edges of the graph. By pairing this prior distribution with our three models of noise generation, we propose Maximum A Posteriori (M.A.P.) estimates of the true signal in the presence of noisy data and provide algorithms for computing the M.A.P. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithms' ability to effectively restore signals from white noise on image data and from severe dropout in single-cell RNA sequence data.

FAR,69371,114088737,114088737,Fostering Student Identities in Introduction to Programming,2023.0,,"Albuquerque, NM, USA",,,"IS curricula typically include at least one course that introduces students to principles of programming in an object-oriented language. The literature is split on whether this language should be Python, Java, C# or something else. No matter the language, students in an IS major or minor can be resistant and unprepared to learn programming or any topic involving math skills (unlike those studying Computer Science or Engineering). Some researchers have investigated how to make the course more accessible for beginning students. Students' own resistance and lack of self-confidence can make teaching this course challenging. If student apprehensions are not managed, programming courses can directly lead to high rates of attrition from the IS major, particularly by underrepresented students who do not see themselves reflected in mainstream role models. We suggest that a new approach is needed to reach all IS students and to help them to both see the value of learning how to code in an object-oriented language and to connect that value to their individual sense of identity. We present an assignment used in an introduction to programming course that seeks to make individual and multi-faceted identities salient throughout the course by allowing students to work through these identities and to observe relevant connections to themselves in the course. This assignment was developed based on the instructor's research expertise in identity theory. This teaching approach has helped the instructor to build more relevant and engaging examples for students and to dynamically change assignments each semester. This practical, hands-on approach applies theory to fostering students' fledgling identities as future IS professionals.",,[],,"[{""id"": 69371, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The partnership at focus is between two large public research universities in the US and the UK. I focused on matched faculty pairs, that is, co-Principal Investigators, one from each side of the partnership, from diverse disciplines: genomics, psychology, and linguistics. In cases where I was able to recruit just one faculty from either side in a dozen other disciplines (in relation to whomever their collaborators were), their data were used for substantiating or diversifying the matched faculty findings. I interviewed 19 participants from all five available partnership cycles, from 2014 to 2019 (six for matched pairs and 13 to enhance the study). I sought to understand and explain faculty experiences and perceptions of various institutional and organization culture factors and symmetries and asymmetries in learning patterns that facilitated or hindered research collaboration, and the kinds of recommendations and visions of sustainability that the faculty had for the partnership. Findings were organized into themes: four at the institutional level, three at the organizational culture level, three learning patterns, and five recommendations. I refined and extended the learning pattern framework and drew questions of importance for future research (e.g., a post-Covid follow-up study) and implications for practice.

While approaches vary and success depends on a number of factors, research demonstrates that an integrated approach to professional skill development is the most impactful for student learning. How can an engineering program build an integrated approach that provides meaningful communication education? This paper shares the experiences from faculty in a material science and engineering program that has created an integrated approach to communication and is working toward creating a cohesive culture around communication and professional skill development. This program started small: one faculty member from technical communication was recruited to work with a faculty teaching junior- and senior-level project courses. The focus of the program was primarily on bolstering written skills, but in recent years has expanded to consider professional skills more broadly, including working on diverse teams and supporting equity and inclusion through writing and collaboration. The goal of this paper is to share where the program is currently and the next steps to expand efforts to continue to support student learning. Starting in 2022, the integrated communication education has been expanded to the sophomore lab to create a three-course sequence focused on communication and professional skill development. This scaffolding and multi-year focus allows faculty to build student confidence in their ability to work as technical professionals after they graduate. By the time undergraduates reach their senior capstone, they are more fully prepared to take on complex communication situations within challenging team projects. Future efforts focus on more consistently scaffolding writing throughout the full materials science program and engaging a larger set of faculty around these areas. The paper will share findings of how efforts have supported student learning and explore how faculty can address areas that still need support. Overall, this collaboration has not only allowed the materials science program to fully meet ABET outcomes but also understand the ways communication support enables graduates to develop engineering identities and move into the next phase with the skills they need to be successful.",,[],,"[{""id"": 70073, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

We have taught IS Project Management in business schools for the past decade and during that time, the general format of PMI’s Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) has remained relatively stable - until now. It is still unknown how the field of project management itself will adapt in response to the PMBOK changes, but when it does, instructors need to be prepared. To help other instructors meet this upcoming challenge head-on, we will present our detailed plan for revising the project management course. We will briefly define the new terms and present a systematic process for mapping existing project management concepts to the new concepts, as well as identify gaps and opportunities to expand the course to meet students’ current and future needs. This paper will interest anyone who teaches project management to IT and IS students and who is not yet up to speed on the new PMBOK. We will also welcome questions or suggestions for future adaptations.",,[],https://iscap.us/proceedings/2023/abstracts/5971.html,"[{""id"": 71438, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The Effects of Formal and Informal Sales Controls on the Attitudes, Behaviors, and Performance of B2B Salespeople",2023.0,,"Toronto, Canada",,,"This research explores three broad questions: What are the relationships among formal and informal sales controls? How do formal and informal sales controls influence a salesperson’s identification (commitment) versus compliance (submission) to an organization, and through these processes, How do formal and informal sales controls influence salesperson attitudes, behaviors, and performance? We develop a theoretical framework based on organizational identification and empirically test our hypotheses in a two-wave study among 750 business-to-business (B2B) salespeople across a variety of industries and organizations. We find that most types of sales controls support self-control and/or identification, while activity control simply leads to compliance. While both identification and compliance positively influence sales performance, identification (compliance) has a positive (negative) relationship with more long-term indicators of salesperson performance, like job satisfaction and loyalty. Our findings have implications for our understanding of how formal and informal controls fit together, their influence on organizational commitment, and their downstream effects on attitudes, behavior, and performance.",,[],,"[{""id"": 71471, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Protein Transformer with Scattering, Attention and Positional Embedding (ProtSCAPE), which is based on the geometric scattering transform together with transformer-based attention mechanisms designed to capture and interpolate protein dynamics from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. ProtSCAPE utilizes the multi-scale nature of the geometric scattering transform to extract features from protein structures conceptualized as graphs. It then integrates these features with dual attention structures, which focus on the residues and amino acid signals respectively, to generate latent representations of protein trajectories. Furthermore, ProtSCAPE incorporates a regression head to generate a structured, temporally coherent latent space, facilitating the accurate interpolation of protein conformations.

We investigate the fluid inventory of the incoming plate and forearc of the N. Hikurangi margin offshore the North Island of New Zealand. This system hosts recurring shallow slow slip events (SSEs) near the trench, and abundant active seeps onshore, both of which suggest a key role of fluid entrainment with the subducting slab. Recent geophysical surveys and drilling show that the incoming plate of the Hikurangi Plateau carries a thick (>1.5 km) blanket of extensively hydrated volcaniclastic sediment, immediately overlying the basement, into the subduction zone. While the total inventory of fluid in this unit has been estimated from P-wave velocity, the proportions of mineral-bound (φ b ) vs. interstitial (φ i ) water remain poorly known, except where drilling has sampled the uppermost few hundred m, and indicate that its 48 vol% water content is equally partitioned between the two reservoirs. This partitioning and its variation with depth and across the shallow forearc are fundamental toward quantifying the loci of dewatering, which occurs at different depths and temperatures for the two components as subduction-driven burial proceeds. We combine laboratory measurements of compression behavior for sediments cored on the Hikurangi Plateau (IODP Sites U1520 and U1526) with thermodynamic models of low-T ( ° C) metamorphic dehydration, to parse the contributions of φ i and φ b as functions of depth and distance into the subduction zone. We take a two-pronged approach: (1) estimating φ b from the difference of total water content profiles derived from P-wave velocity, and φ i predicted from experimentally-defined sediment compression behavior; and (2) independently predicting φ i profiles from the total water content less the thermodynamically modeled φ b profiles. The two approaches converge, and suggest that φ b decreases with depth discontinuously, from >~25% at the top of the unit, to ~10% at its base. As this unit is subducted, it loses significant interstitial water by compaction, but φ b remains ~8-10% even 15 km landward of the trench. We suggest that this large reservoir of subducting mineral-bound fluid plays a key role in both SSE and the numerous active deeply-sourced seeps observed on the forearc",,[],,"[{""id"": 74645, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

This makes it one of the fastest-slipping continental-oceanic transform systems globally. Transpressional deformation occurs along the fault, this is controlled by variations in fault strike with respect to plate motion leading to increasing degrees of convergence along strike from north to south. The National Science Foundation-funded Transform Obliquity on the Queen Charlotte Fault and Earthquake Study (TOQUES) gathered new multichannel seismic reflection data along a ~450 km fault section in 2021. This work focuses on the northern area, site of the 2013 Mw 7.5 Craig, Alaska earthquake. Aftershock sequences suggest that the main QCF dips eastwards or active fault strands exist within the North American plate. We present seismic profiles crossing the 2013 epicentral region, examining fault zone architecture, crustal deformation mechanisms, and deep structural relationships. The sections reveal a series of normal faults within the Pacific crust, a slightly dipping eastwards Pacific basement, and sediments containing multiple vertical faults at the base of the continental slope. The main QCF trace is located on the continental slope. Mid-slope basins record several deformation stages and host multiple vertical faults. On the North American plate continental shelf, we see glacially truncated, east-dipping strata and minor seafloor sediment deformation.

The Queen Charlotte Plate Boundary (QCPB) is a transform boundary separating the Pacific and North American plates offshore western British Columbia. The QCPB is one of Earth’s fastest slipping continent-ocean transforms and is a source of large earthquakes in the northeastern pacific. The 2012 M7.8 Haida Gwaii thrust earthquake and its tsunami renewed interest in the QCPB, especially in its southern section that experiences oblique convergence (from ~5-25°). Mechanisms to accommodate the oblique convergence fall into two end members: crustal thickening of the Pacific plate or underthrusting of the Pacific plate, both of which could produce the Queen Charlotte Terrace (QCT), a bathymetric high offshore Haida Gwaii. Previous subsurface imaging is limited to shallow-penetrating studies that leave most of the QCT’s deep crustal structure largely unknown. Here, we use multichannel seismic reflection data collected in 2021 acquired with a 15 km-long hydrophone streamer to study the crustal structure offshore Haida Gwaii. Our images reveal for the first time that Pacific plate crust and sediment is underthrusting beneath the QCT, topped by the Haida Gwaii thrust. The Haida Gwaii thrust extends to the shelf, near the QCF at depth and along-strike for at least ~170 km, elevating the seismic and tsunami hazard in this region. The QCT is made from sub-parallel ridges formed by thin-skinned thrust faults branching off the Haida Gwaii thrust, which accommodate the oblique convergence along with the underthrusting. Strain is partitioned between the QCT and the QCF, which suggests that the terrace is more analogous to an oblique subduction zone crustal sliver than to other transform plate boundaries.

In particular, the region displays distinct segmentation of seismicity, with rupture zones hosting quasi-periodic, M w ~6 earthquakes alternating with barrier zones that inhibit rupture propagation. As such, the GTF provides an ideal natural laboratory for studying seismic behavior and earthquake genesis. One possible explanation for the observed seismic segmentation is variations in the volume and properties of fluids within the crust. We used controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) methods to gain insight into crustal porosity variations throughout the fault system. Our survey was part of a multidisciplinary study aimed at disentangling the complexities of stress evolution, deformation, and pore fluid presence within the GTF. The CSEM system deployed included one deep-towed source transmitting over 300 A of current on a 300 m dipole, and two fixed-offset, three-axis, towed electric field receivers known as Vulcans. The data measured by the Vulcan receivers are influenced primarily by variations in the pore fluid distribution in the uppermost ~ 500 m of seafloor. We present preliminary 2-D inversion models derived from Vulcan data to delineate the electrical resistivity along the strike of the GTF. Initial results indicate a relatively conductive surface layer suggestive of high porosity extrusive oceanic crust and thus high fluid content. We interpret our initial Vulcan models alongside coincident CSEM data collected on seafloor instruments, seismic data, and water column data collected by the autonomous vehicle SENTRY. This joint-interpretation approach allows us to connect variations in porosity to variations in the behavior of the rupture and barrier zones of the GTF.

FAR,74649,114019426,114019426,Fluid reservoirs of the Hikurangi Plateau and their implications for subduction processes,2024.0,,,,,"New Zealand's Hikurangi margin is known for recurring shallow slow slip, numerous forearc seeps, and a productive volcanic arc. Fluids derived from the subducting slab are implicated in these processes. However, prior studies lacked evidence of basic crustal structure of the slab, or of its water content that would allow an assessment of fluid budgets. We review several recent studies that place bounds on the fluid reservoirs within the subducting Hikurangi Plateau that could be released between the forearc and backarc regions. Subducting sediments are thickest (> 1 km) in the southern Hikurangi margin, where there is a unit of turbidites beneath the regional proto decollement. These subducting sediments begin draining near the deformation front, resulting in a 20-30 % loss of volumetric fluid content. In contrast, the central and northern Hikurangi margins lack a continuous unit of subducting sediment. Here, lenses of poorly drained sediment underthrust the forearc in the wakes of seamount collisions. The Hikurangi Plateau's crustal structure resembles normal oceanic crust with a doubled upper crust of basalt and diabase. Above this upper crust is a ~1.5 km thick unit of hydrated volcaniclastic conglomerates. Seamounts can locally increase the upper crust's thickness by an extra ~1-3 km, raising the amount of porous, altered volcanic material. Finally, P-wave velocity models of the slab's upper mantle show velocity changes that could indicate moderate differences in serpentinization. Active bend-faults that could circulate fluids to the upper mantle are sparse prior to subduction. However, upon subduction the upper mantle seismic velocities of the Hikurangi Plateau are significantly less in the north compared to the south, possibly due to enhanced slab faulting beneath the forearc. Separate thermo-petrologic models for the shallow forearc and deeper subduction system suggests that fluid release from volcaniclastic units and the thickened Hikurangi Plateau upper crust is expected to occur over a range of depths extending from ~12 km to ~130 km, providing fluids for onshore seep systems and hydrous melting of the mantle wedge, whereas dehydration of serpentinite is greatest beyond the arc front. Subducting sediments and volcaniclastic units are the most readily available source of fluids for shallow slow slip.",,[],,"[{""id"": 74649, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,75411,112054227,112054227,Navigating English Learning for Migrant and Immigrant Students in the USA,2024.0,Pixel,"Rome, Italy",,,"There is a controversial national debate taking place in the United States regarding immigration policy. Migrant and immigrant children are impacted by social and educational inequalities and are often entangled in the political climate that surrounds them [1]. Unfortunately, migrant and immigrant children who are entering schools are caught up in the multiplicity of challenges facing educators and families. Educators are often unprepared and feel overwhelmed with large classes, meeting the initial requirement to screen all entering students to determine their language level, and coaching other teachers. Meanwhile, families are attempting to navigate a new system and understand the expectations [2]. The opportunity to learn English and access educational resources is tantamount to bridging the gaps that these students are facing to navigate a new school system and environment. This presentation/manuscript examines strategies for English learning for migrant and immigrant students in the USA. It features research, pedagogy and curriculum that promotes optimal English learning for students grappling with access to quality education programs. Students are exploring their own identities and learning to speak English in diverse classrooms with numerous native languages and educators who may be unprepared to meet their needs and are following a standardized curriculum. To celebrate the genius of children who are becoming successful in language rich contexts that do not meet the “one size fits all” curriculum, strategies are suggested that can be assessed informally and include multiple media [3]. Successful classroom methodologies grounded in research tailored to meet the needs of migrant and immigrant students must include flexibility and attention to affective domains as well as concentration on the development of English competency. Simultaneously, the four key elements of speaking, listening, reading, and writing are essential skill areas to learning English and need instruction and practice for cognitive function. This study and investigation will follow up on the crucial questions that relate to embracing English learning, new technologies, and initiating academic success through proactive educational strategies including a paradigm shift to incorporate a translanguaging pedagogy for emergent bilingual students leading to relevant and purposeful accomplishments. By addressing a myriad of innovative, flexible strategies coupled with meeting the challenges experienced by migrant and immigrant students and their teachers, positive strides are made leading to significant accomplishments in achieving the building blocks of English language development and educational success. The information presented lends itself to a variety of student ages, levels, and settings, and can be applied across the curriculum.",,[],,"[{""id"": 75411, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
FAR,75414,112054227,112054227,Exceptionally Gifted Females: Multiple Facets of Diversity and Gender Equity,2024.0,Pixel,"Rome, Italy",,,"The objective of this study is to provide an overview of challenges facing gifted and talented females, explore gender differences among intellectually gifted students, and examine the literature and research addressing gender in a variety of dimensions of cognitive giftedness. The unique and often frustrating experiences that gifted and talented females encounter will be explored to understand gender stereotypes. The findings are centered on the benefits, predicaments, and determination of gifted and talented females as we embrace multiple facets of diversity and gender equity. There are a wide variety of perspectives on gender and high ability or highly talented females and academic achievement. Gender has often been a critical factor when identifying multidimensional perspectives of giftedness. The combined results from 130 studies published between 1975 and 2011 indicated that boys were 1.19 times more likely than girls to be identified as gifted and included in gifted programs [1]. The early literature on giftedness, dominated by male authors, focused largely on mathematical and scientific manifestations of giftedness, and had a highly misogynistic character. Subsequent research and expanded definitions of giftedness have made significant changes in these views and encouraged a more diverse population that will enrich others and allow gifted females to excel and reach their full potential. Even though most people have some degree of emotional intelligence (EI), EI studies have shown that females demonstrate a higher degree of EI than males do [2]. Barriers to gifted women achieving their full potential are both external and internal— societal and psychological. Recent literature features significant studies by female gifted education specialists, and has been valuable in its stress on leadership, learning, and providing professional insight in narrowing the gender gap and facilitating a stronger female presence [3]. The goal of the present study is to synthesize data on gender differences in gifted identification and programs. The research reviewed addressed males and females in a variety of dimensions of cognitive giftedness, but most frequently those related to manifesting quantitative gifts. Recommendations for reducing gender bias include encouraging girls to participate in gifted programs, mentoring, and using multiple assessment criteria to identify gifted students.",,[],,"[{""id"": 75414, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2025, ""termid"": ""2024/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

I-Corps prepares university and federal lab scientists and engineers to extend their focus beyond the laboratory to accelerate the transfer of cutting-edge research into commercial success. As I-Corps has expanded, it has made its presence felt in academic entrepreneurship. There are now ten NSF I-Corps Regional “Hubs,” involving over 80 research universities. According to the NSF I-Corps Biennial Report (2021), I-Corps has educated more than 6,500 grant participants from the NSF, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Department of Energy (DOE), and trained more than 2,300 entrepreneurial teams. These teams are typically small (i.e., three individuals) and include individuals with both scientific and business-related expertise. I-Corps teams have raised more than $1.2 Billion in subsequent funding for start-up activity. Evaluating the effectiveness of the I-Corps program is critical to its future success since NSF and other federal agencies are looking to expand the program. Duval-couetil, Epstein, and Huang-saad (2022) note that I-Corps has been evaluated in a number of ways, and they suggest a need for alternative evaluation and assessment data that could be used to better understand the effects of regional programs, as well as how those programs might be improved. However, the overarching theme of this symposium is linking entrepreneurship and innovation literature to assess the effectiveness of an entrepreneurship training program (the NSF I-Corps program) on generating potential entrepreneurs (academic entrepreneurs) and show how this program is producing sustainable impacts on society (innovations). Four presentations are included in the symposium, representing different approaches to understanding the critical role of Hubs of I-Corps trainees across the U.S. by reinforcing the fundamental components of the entrepreneurial and innovation process. The presentations in this session illustrate a variety of “micro” and “macro” perspectives on academic entrepreneurship (Waldman, Vaulont, Balven, Siegel, & Rupp, 2022; Siegel & Wright, 2015), including theories of organizational justice; identity; role conflict; ambivalence; championing/leadership; feedback; knowledge spillovers; diversity, equity, and inclusion; business model experimentation; pivoting; strategy formulation and implementation; networks; and team dynamics. Likewise, novel methods to provide evidence and implications. Our session is also inspired by the AOM 2024 theme “Innovating for the future: policy, purpose and organizations” since it deals with a federal program that is targeted to train the next generation of successful academic entrepreneurs.",,[],,"[{""id"": 75582, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The overarching objective of these ecosystems is to act as a facilitative milieu for high-growth ventures. Within the United States, there exists a pronounced emphasis on advancing entrepreneurial initiatives in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as these ventures are more likely to result in companies that grow beyond their entrepreneur (Schumpeter, 1934). Universities, in concert with governmental support structures, occupy a pivotal role in the orchestration and evolution of EEs. Noteworthy in this regard is the proactive involvement of the National Science Foundation (NSF), which has championed a program specifically designed to support nascent entrepreneurs. This session will be of interest to any faculty member involved with innovation, entrepreneurs, or entrepreneurship. As academics, we don’t always have the time to reflect on our role and place within the larger environment. This session will give participants the opportunity to share with and learn from their peers. This session will introduce and discuss the entrepreneur ecosystem framework and then use examples to illustrate its application, which will also include the I-Corps training program and its training outcomes.

FAR,75739,112176072,112176072,Remediation Strategies for Mitigating Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Consequences of Wildfires,2024.0,,,,,"Wildfires can be natural or anthropogenic occurrences with immediate and long-term effects on ecosystems, human health, hydrology, hydrogeology, and slope stability. Wildfire events are becoming more frequent due to climate change and human activity. Covering vast areas of land, ranging in frequency, intensity and severity, and duration, fires influence soil and vegetation's physical, chemical, and biological processes. The long-term effects of widespread wildfires on soil processes are often unknown. Fires cause soil to become hydrophobic, lacking the ability to infiltrate water, leaving ash litter. Burned soil can also lose nutrients, which, along with lowered infiltration, can slow down revegetation. The run-off and loss of vegetation can lead to soil erosion, leaving a magnitude of aftereffects that can affect water and air quality, slope stability, and even human health. Methods suitable to treat, restore, and remediate burned soils depend on the fire's severity and the ecosystem's conditions pre- and post-fire. There has yet to be a one-size-fits-all solution to managing the aftereffects of wildfires because there are critical knowledge gaps on impacts on soils, the more significant ecological ramifications, and our ability to manage or remediate these impacts. This paper presents an overview of previous studies on remediating wildfire-impacted soils to better understand the impacts of post-fire management practices on ecosystems with differing characteristics. Still, there needs to be more guidelines about the effectiveness and feasibility of these remediation strategies.",,[],,"[{""id"": 75739, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
FAR,75740,112176072,112176072,Potential of Utilizing Food Processing Waste for Ground Improvement,2024.0,,,,,"One of the applications of hydrous and quick lime is removing impurities from several food products, such as agricultural goods. This process generates a large amount of waste that consists of calcium carbonate precipitates, organic matter, and traces of soil, fertilizers, and other elements (e.g., heavy metals). Even though the waste comes from the food industry, it is not biodegradable because of its chemical composition. It is also too bulky to be disposed of in landfills. Therefore, the waste is currently stocked on lands near the food processing plants generating the waste, which is not a viable or eco-friendly solution. Finding a way to use this waste material, sustainably and economically, could reduce the cost of construction projects and the land investment of food processing facilities. This waste from food processing has a similar content to unspent Lime products that are sold commercially and can be used for construction purposes. As lime stabilization is a proven method to enhance the strength and shrinkage properties of clay soils, this waste can potentially be used for similar purposes. This paper examines the use of this waste for ground improvement, where the gravimetric organic content is <5%. Several engineering properties (e.g., unconfined compressive strength, swell potential, permeability) were measured using a series of laboratory tests to find the optimal series of tests and the suitable mixtures of problematic soils and food processing waste. Once the procedures are standardized, using these materials in ground-improvement applications could create an additional source of income for some food processing facilities.",,[],,"[{""id"": 75740, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

The program aims to offer students a unique blend of physical challenge, cultural immersion, and academic enrichment. The study assesses student interest, with 64% expressing excitement about a trip involving hiking 10-18 miles per day, particularly among sophomores. Motivational factors include a sense of adventure, cultural exchange, and historical exploration, with top elective course choices being courses on sustainability in construction and historic perspectives in construction. The perceived benefits of the program include deep cultural immersion, personal growth, physical activity, and hands-on academic learning, while potential drawbacks are cost, physical challenges, extensive planning, homesickness, and the risk of injury. Administrative challenges involve early agreements on course administration, tuition payments, and enrollment procedures, as well as clear communication and emergency preparedness plans. To address these challenges, the study suggests operating the program as two separate but coordinated programs, pre-booking accommodations, using group flights, and collaborating with third-party vendors for logistics and safety support. The findings provide valuable insights into the feasibility and potential success of a collaborative study abroad program in construction management.",,[],,"[{""id"": 77409, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}]"

The overarching objective of these ecosystems is to act as a facilitative milieu for high-growth ventures. Within the United States, there exists a pronounced emphasis on advancing entrepreneurial initiatives in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as these ventures are more likely to result in companies that grow beyond their entrepreneur (Schumpeter, 1934). Universities, in concert with governmental support structures, occupy a pivotal role in the orchestration and evolution of EEs. Noteworthy in this regard is the proactive involvement of the National Science Foundation (NSF), which has championed a program specifically designed to support nascent entrepreneurs. This session will be of interest to any faculty member involved with innovation, entrepreneurs, or entrepreneurship. As academics, we don’t always have the time to reflect on our role and place within the larger environment. This session will give participants the opportunity to share with and learn from their peers. This session will introduce and discuss the entrepreneur ecosystem framework and then use examples to illustrate its application, which will also include the I-Corps training program and its training outcomes. I-Corps is an NSF-funded program aimed at supporting University-led innovation commercialization. Results from I-Corps-supported research will be discussed, and two (or more) members of the national I-Corps program will discuss their experiences.",,[],,"[{""id"": 77688, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
FAR,77689,111643654,111643654,Training Academic Entrepreneurs to Innovate for the Future: Evidence from the I-Corps Program,2024.0,,,,,"OVERVIEW OF SYMPOSIUM In 2011, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) established the Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program, which has become the world’s largest entrepreneurial training program for would-be academic entrepreneurs. I-Corps prepares university and federal lab scientists and engineers to extend their focus beyond the laboratory to accelerate the transfer of cutting-edge research into commercial success. As I-Corps has expanded, it has made its presence felt in academic entrepreneurship. There are now ten NSF I-Corps Regional “Hubs,” involving over 80 research universities. According to the NSF I-Corps Biennial Report (2021), I-Corps has educated more than 6,500 grant participants from the NSF, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Department of Energy (DOE), and trained more than 2,300 entrepreneurial teams. These teams are typically small (i.e., three individuals) and include individuals with both scientific and business-related expertise. I-Corps teams have raised more than $1.2 Billion in subsequent funding for start-up activity. Evaluating the effectiveness of the I-Corps program is critical to its future success since NSF and other federal agencies are looking to expand the program. Duval-couetil, Epstein, and Huang-saad (2022) note that I-Corps has been evaluated in a number of ways, and they suggest a need for alternative evaluation and assessment data that could be used to better understand the effects of regional programs, as well as how those programs might be improved. However, the overarching theme of this symposium is linking entrepreneurship and innovation literature to assess the effectiveness of an entrepreneurship training program (the NSF I-Corps program) on generating potential entrepreneurs (academic entrepreneurs) and show how this program is producing sustainable impacts on society (innovations). Four presentations are included in the symposium, representing different approaches to understanding the critical role of Hubs of I-Corps trainees across the U.S. by reinforcing the fundamental components of the entrepreneurial and innovation process. The presentations in this session illustrate a variety of “micro” and “macro” perspectives on academic entrepreneurship (Waldman, Vaulont, Balven, Siegel, & Rupp, 2022; Siegel & Wright, 2015), including theories of organizational justice; identity; role conflict; ambivalence; championing/leadership; feedback; knowledge spillovers; diversity, equity, and inclusion; business model experimentation; pivoting; strategy formulation and implementation; networks; and team dynamics. Likewise, novel methods to provide evidence and implications. Our session is also inspired by the AOM 2024 theme “Innovating for the future: policy, purpose and organizations” since it deals with a federal program that is targeted to train the next generation of successful academic entrepreneurs.",,[],,"[{""id"": 77689, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"

FAR,77786,111727706,111727706,"Rural Educational Contexts: English Learner Students, Families and Teachers.",2024.0,Filodiritto Editore,Italy,,,"The current charged and divisive sociopolitical climate is a disharmony of voices, viewpoints, and experiences. However, many realities and experiences remain absent from conversations about educational policies and practices. This presentation addresses the education of rural English learners, their families, and their teachers, whose experiences and “truths” have been virtually absent from the broad landscape of educational research. In their absence, little is known about how rurality intersects with English learners and how “post-truth” discourses affect teachers and students. This paper aims to bring voice and broaden views regarding the intersection of rurality and EL education in the US. One diverse subgroup in rural settings are emergent bilingual students, described here as English learners (ELs). Despite the fact that scholars have noted the increase in number of EL students in non-urbanized, non-traditional ‘new destination’ settings, commensurate research has not been conducted [1]. Data show that nearly 15% of EL-identified students reside in rural settings [2] in the US. And although rural EL students constitute nearly 5% of the overall K-12 public school students, their experiences as well as those of their teachers and families remain underrepresented in the research on education [3]. This paper aims to bring voice and broaden views regarding the intersection of rurality and EL education in the US.",,[],,"[{""id"": 77786, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]"
