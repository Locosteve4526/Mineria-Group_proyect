        "Description/Abstract": "The autosomal dominant chondrodystrophies, the Stickler type 2 and Marshall syndromes, are characterized by facial abnormalities, vision deficits, hearing loss, and articular joint issues resulting from mutations in . Zebrafish carry two copies of the  gene, designated  and .  is located on zebrafish chromosome 24 and  is located on zebrafish chromosome 2. Expression patterns are distinct for  and  and  is most similar to  that is responsible for human autosomal chondrodystrophies and the gene responsible for changes in the chondrodystrophic mouse model . We investigated the function of  in craniofacial and axial skeletal development in zebrafish using a knockdown approach. Knockdown revealed abnormalities in Meckel's cartilage, the otoliths, and overall body length. Similar phenotypes were observed using a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing approach, although the CRISPR/Cas9 effect was more severe compared to the transient effect of the antisense morpholino oligonucleotide treatment. The results of this study provide evidence that the zebrafish gene for  is required for normal development and has similar functions to the mammalian  gene. Due to its transparency, external fertilization, the  knockdown, and knockout zebrafish model systems can, therefore, contribute to filling the gap in knowledge about early events during vertebrate skeletal development that are not as tenable in mammalian model systems and help us understand -related early developmental events.",
