        "Description/Abstract": "The Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) is currently listed as a sensitive species by the\r\nU.S.D.A. Forest Service. Previous research in our study area, the South Hills of the Minidoka\r\nRanger District of the Sawtooth National Forest, Idaho, showed possible signs of parasite\r\ninfections among the banded adults and nestlings, which could influence their breeding success.\r\nTherefore, we sought to quantify the prevalence and intensity of Leucocytozoon parasites among\r\nnestling goshawks in the unique sky island habitat in south-central Idaho during the 2012\r\nbreeding season. We sampled 27 nestlings from 12 nests for Leucocytozoon parasites by\r\nexamining blood smears. All of these nestlings were infected with Leucocytozoon parasites. The\r\ninfection intensity of ranged from 8.20 - 100.45 Leucocytozoon parasites per 10,000 erythrocytes\r\n(mean \u00b1 SE = 43.52 \u00b1 5.37). Using elevation, distance-to-water, nestling age, sex and nesting\r\nsubstrate as predictor variables for infection intensity by Leucocytozoon parasites, we employed\r\nan information theoretic approach to select a top model to determine the presence of an effect.\r\nOur top model included nesting substrate and elevation as the sole predictors of infection\r\nintensity. Specifically, higher Leucocytozoon parasite intensity was associated with higher\r\nelevation and aspen nesting substrate. The within-nest correlation was 94%. Our results show\r\nthat there is a high prevalence of Leucocytozoon parasites in this population of goshawks and\r\nthat nesting substrate and elevation may influence infection intensity. Further research will help\r\nidentify management implications for this species of concern, as well as other avian species in\r\nthis unusual high altitude shrub-steppe ecosystem.\r\n",
