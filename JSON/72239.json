The RCIM is embedded in the University Foundations courses to introduce first year students to foundational information literacy concepts. This session will discuss the decision to support students\u2019 critical inquiry development by teaching introductory lateral reading skills to evaluate information resources, as well as the benefit to students when they encounter these concepts at the earliest stages of their university experience. We will also discuss key takeaways after a year of grading the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;",
