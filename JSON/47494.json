        "Description/Abstract": "It is a shared mood or atmosphere that determines the way that the world is disclosed to us. If every atmosphere brings with it a shared interpretation of the world, then one needs to share or participate in this atmosphere in order to share knowledge or learning. Only when a Stimmung suitable to such disclosure has been cultivated or encountered will the sought\u2010after knowledge \u201cdawn\u201d on one. I begin by discussing the elusive epistemology of the atmospheric\u2014what we are able to know about how we know, what access we have to the atmospheric, to the mode of our being and knowing. Then, through a brief video example, I go on to discuss what can be seen to make an atmosphere, a shared way of knowing, specifically pedagogical.",
