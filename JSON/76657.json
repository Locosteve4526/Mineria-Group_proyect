        "Description/Abstract": "The Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus) is a species of conservation concern in five states and\u00a0two provinces, including South Dakota. Populations breeding in the US are fairly stable at ~180,000 individuals (Stanley and Skagen 2007, Gregory et al. 2012). However, declines are likely to continue with the\u00a0loss and degradation of habitat throughout the areas used in the species\u2019 annual cycle (Figure 1). As a part\u00a0of a broader study (Boisestate.edu/ibo/curlews), we tagged four female Long-billed Curlews nesting in&lt;br&gt;South Dakota in 2022. Herein we describe their movements and migrations. These curlews are the first to\u00a0be tracked from nests in the Dakotas, an area that now represents the eastern edge of the species\u2019 retracted\u00a0inland breeding range.",
