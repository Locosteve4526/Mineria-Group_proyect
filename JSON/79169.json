        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;br&gt;Understanding sexual behavior and its determinants among college students is crucial for&lt;br&gt;promoting sexual health and well-being. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) may play&lt;br&gt;a role in shaping sexual behaviors. The current study investigates the association&lt;br&gt;between ACEs, condom use frequency, demographics, and consensual sexual intercourse&lt;br&gt;among undergraduate college students.&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;Upon IRB approval, a paper survey was administered among undergraduate college&lt;br&gt;students enrolled in the Health Promotion and Education classes at a midwestern urban&lt;br&gt;campus. A total of 152 participants were recruited through convenient sampling. Results:&lt;br&gt;A univariate regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between&lt;br&gt;sexual intercourse and categories of ACEs, age, condom use frequency, racial/ethnic&lt;br&gt;identity, sexual orientation and sex assigned at birth. Age, condom use frequency, racial/&lt;br&gt;ethnic identity as Asian and Caucasian were significant at p &lt; 0.05. Furthermore, a final&lt;br&gt;logistic regression model was significant (\u03c7\u00b2 = 127.740, df = 4, p &lt; .001). Participant age&lt;br&gt;and racial/ethnic identity as Caucasian emerged as significant in the model.&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;The findings of this study encourage universities to expand their focus beyond traditional&lt;br&gt;socio-demographic and educational factors when addressing risky sexual behaviors&lt;br&gt;among college students. It highlights that ACEs may be a lingering influence driving&lt;br&gt;sexual activity, suggesting that trauma-informed, tailored approaches can more&lt;br&gt;effectively promote safe practices and address diverse student needs.&lt;/p&gt;",
