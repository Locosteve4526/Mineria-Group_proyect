What if we stopped assigning point values and started emphasizing individual growth toward demonstration of skill mastery? This session will describe the concept of specifications grading, provide tangible examples of how to incorporate this practice, and discuss the potential benefits (and pitfalls) of reimagining and reestablishing the role of the instructor as the facilicator of learning, rather than the gatekeeper of grades.\u00a0",
