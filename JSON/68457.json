        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Hearing one\u2019s name called on draft day is the dream of many college football athletes. Not only is it validation of their hard work and talent as an athlete, it typically means life-changing wealth for those who are drafted as it provides the draftee with a four-year NFL contract.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;This is particularly true the higher a player is drafted, like the Chicago Bears\u2019 second round pick Gervon Dexter, who was granted a 4-year contract worth up to $6.7 million and with around $3.7 million guaranteed by virtue of his draft slot.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But as pleased as Dexter may have been with his new life-changing wealth, there was a firm that was likely even more excited about his new NFL deal, Big League Advantage (BLA). When Dexter was playing at the University of Florida in 2022, he signed a deal with BLA that provided him with a one-time payment of $436,485. In exchange, Dexter agreed to give up 15% (pre-tax) of his future NFL earnings for the next 25 years.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Even if Dexter makes only the minimum guaranteed on his contract, and does not make it to a second contract, the earnings from Dexter\u2019s rookie deal alone would net a healthy return on investment (ROI) for BLA. If Dexter completes his rookie contract and gets a second contract, the payout to BLA could reach several millions of dollars, all in exchange for a one-time payment of $436,485.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, there are questions whether BLA\u2019s arrangement with Dexter holds up to legal scrutiny. To this end, Dexter filed suit against BLA in September 2023 seeking a declaratory judgment rendering the contract unenforceable.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;In the complaint, Dexter alleges that the agreement violates Florida\u2019s NIL Statute&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;and Athlete Agent statute.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;While, on its face, the Dexter/BLA agreement does not look like a traditional NIL deal, Dexter alleges that the agreement also authorized BLA to use his NIL in advertising and publications, and required that Dexter promote BLA on his social media accounts, sign autographs, and make personal appearances thus making it into an NIL deal within the definitions provided under Florida law.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This lawsuit raises interesting questions regarding what constitutes an NIL contract and what constitutes an agent under Florida statute. The lawsuit also brings to light several other potential issues with the BLA business model. Indeed, for those who follow Major League Baseball closely, the Dexter story may sound familiar. BLA does not exclusively work in college sports; to the contrary, BLA got its start in 2016 with Minor League Baseball players.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Similarly, BLA (then called \u201cBig League Advance\u201d) faced similar scrutiny in 2018 when they were sued by then Cleveland Indians catcher, Francisco Mejia, over an agreement in which BLA paid Mejia $360,000 for 10% of his future MLB earnings.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;In the suit, Mejia alleged that the contract is unconscionable because, among other things, he spoke little English and did not have an interpreter present at the signing.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;The complaint also alleged that BLA breached its duty of fair dealing and claimed unjust enrichment for BLA under the agreement.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;However, Mejia would drop his lawsuit just a few months later and even went as far as to apologize to BLA and affirm that he planned to honor his initial agreement as part of a settlement agreement to breach of contract counterclaims made by BLA against him.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These high-profile lawsuits that boast robust ROI\u2019s for BLA have called into question whether BLA\u2019s business model is \u201cpredatory\u201d and whether these \u201cloans\u201d are usurious.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;On its face, the business appears to operate somewhat similarly to payday loans. Much like payday lenders, BLA offers its customers cash up front in exchange for their future earnings. Payday loans have a default rate of over 50% and attempt to compensate for that by charging extremely high interest rates.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;BLA admits that they, \u201c... expect to lose money on the vast majority of the players [they] sign,\u201d&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;and they compensate for this risk by taking percentages of potentially 9-figure contracts of their athletes.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Similar to the ire drawn by the news of the perceived unfairness of the deals BLA signs, payday lenders are not particularly well thought of. In addition to being associated with higher incidents of bankruptcy,&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;payday loans have been described by consumer advocates and policymakers as \u201can immoral practice,\u201d a \u201ctrap\u201d and having \u201cunrealistic payment terms.\u201d&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Thus, the payday lending industry is subject to a fair amount of regulatory scrutiny[19] which BLA has, at least thus far, largely evaded.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite these similarities there is at least one major distinguishing factor between BLA and payday lenders: BLA agreements are not loans\u2013at least according to BLA.&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Rather, BLA argues that they offer cash payments in exchange for percentages of speculative future income from a professional sports league.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;As such, BLA claims they are more akin to a venture capital firm than a lender.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Venture capital is a form of private equity wherein firms backed by investors make decisions to invest in a company\u2019s long term potential in exchange for partial ownership of the company.&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The key delineating difference, however, between BLA and venture capital is that venture capital buys equity in a company, BLA buys equity in people\u2013a concept that has been a key part of our ethical debate for decades. The theoretical concept of buying equity shares in a person\u2019s future earnings is believed to have been conceived by famed economist Milton Friedman, who referred to such agreements as human capital contracts.&lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;The idea was first tested in the 1970s when Yale University sought to replace traditional student loans with a \u201ctuition postponement option\u201d where graduates would share four percent of their future income with Yale in exchange for postponing $1,000 of their tuition payments.&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the Yale program ended in failure and controversy, such agreements are largely seen as an alternative to borrowing money and have even been proposed as a solution to the student debt crisis in the United States.&lt;sup&gt;[26]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;It has also been the basis for dystopian fiction novels&lt;sup&gt;[27]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;and bears at least a minor, yet eerie, similarity to the tale of Rumpelstiltskin.&lt;sup&gt;[28]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Further, depending upon the level of authority the shareholder has, such agreements could raise Thirteenth Amendment concerns regarding involuntary servitude.&lt;sup&gt;[29]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the actual implementation of human capital contracts has never gained much mainstream traction.&lt;sup&gt;[30]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Several educational institutions (copying Yale) entered into so-called \u2018income sharing agreements\u2019 (ISAs) with students as an alternative to borrowing tuition money, however the majority of those programs have ceased.&lt;sup&gt;[31]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;This is due in part to the fact that while these were gaining attention from schools, they were also gaining attention from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) who issued a consent order finding that an ISA provider violated several provisions of the Consumer Financial Protection Act.&lt;sup&gt;[32]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;In July, the CFPB and 11 other states filed a lawsuit against other ISA providers alleging violations of several federal laws relating to lending and debt collection.&lt;sup&gt;[33]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the striking similarities between BLA\u2019s business model and these other ISAs, BLA has somehow avoided any scrutiny from the CFPB or other regulators. This presentation aims to analyze BLA agreements and compare them to other ISAs that have been challenged by the CFPB. It will also provide potential solutions to the issues raised by BLA and propose a regulatory framework for such ISAs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[1] National Football League and National Football League Players' Association.
