        "Description/Abstract": "This article documents the archaeological occurrence of bison (Bison bison) on the Snake River Plain. Evidence from thirty-two Paleoindian and Archaic sites suggests that use of bison occurred on the western and eastern Plain. Sites reflect a variety of local environments and activities. The presence of bison, though relatively common in Late Archaic contexts, does not suggest that bison were depended upon as a major resource. Contrary to Butler s (1978) assertion that bison use decreased during the Late Archaic period, it appears that bison hunting was relatively more common in the later prehistory of the Plain.",
