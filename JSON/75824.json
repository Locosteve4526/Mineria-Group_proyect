This article illustrates how AI tools can help them jumpstart scenario-based e-learning projects with drafts of characters and scenarios, brainstorm evaluation questions, and suggest sample survey items with appropriate response scales. However, L&amp;D professionals should exercise caution before uploading data to AI systems for data analysis, and may need multiple attempts with different prompts to generate appropriate outputs when using text-to-image AI tools.&lt;/span&gt;",
