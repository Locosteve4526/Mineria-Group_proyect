        "Description/Abstract": "The Campus Diversity Questionnaire-Revised (CDQ-R) is a multicultural diversity climate assessment tool containing 23 Likert-type scale agreement-disagreement statements and four demographic questions (age, year in school, gender, and race). The CDQ-R was administered at 11 universities in the United States, and a total of 2,383 students participated. Significant institutional differences emerged as well as individual differences involving age, year in school, gender, and race. These results are helpful in understanding the different constituent needs of students on the college campus.",
