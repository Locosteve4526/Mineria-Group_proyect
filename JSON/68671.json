        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;br&gt;Background: Youth in the U.S. juvenile justice system are exposed to adverse childhood&lt;br&gt;experiences (ACEs) at higher rates than youth in the general public. Additionally, research has demonstrated ACEs can vary by race/ethnicity and gender. However, little is known about how ACEs are experienced across gendered racial/ethnic groups of justice-involved youth.&lt;br&gt;Objective: To address this gap, this exploratory study is the first to apply an intersectional lens&lt;br&gt;to examine the prevalence of ACEs among a group of justice-involved youth in the U.S.&lt;br&gt;Participants &amp; Setting: Using secondary data, this study examines ACEs by gender,&lt;br&gt;race/ethnicity, and six gendered racial/ethnic groups of justice-involved youth referred to the&lt;br&gt;Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&lt;br&gt;Methods: Descriptive analyses are presented by gender and race/ethnicity separately, followed&lt;br&gt;by gendered racial/ethnic groups to understand differential rates of exposure to ACEs.&lt;br&gt;Results: The study's findings align with previous research and reinforce that justice-involved&lt;br&gt;youth experience higher rates of adversity than the general public. The results also support the&lt;br&gt;feminist pathway\u2019s perspective within an intersectional context, emphasizing the importance of&lt;br&gt;accounting for race/ethnicity and gender simultaneously to identify the unique experiences of&lt;br&gt;ACEs among justice-involved youth.&lt;br&gt;Conclusion: Recommendations related to these findings and considerations surrounding ACE&lt;br&gt;measures are discussed. Specifically, findings from this study stress the importance of&lt;br&gt;accounting for gender and race/ethnicity simultaneously when measuring experiences of&lt;br&gt;adversity. This is a critical step to providing equitable treatment and services to address trauma-related needs across gendered racial/ethnic groups of system-involved youth.",
