        "Description/Abstract": "Using  both  openmalaria  simulation  and  a  variant  Ross\u00ad\r\nMacDonald  transmission  model,  we  report  on  enhanced  infection  prevalence \r\nsuppression  with  the  joint  deployment  of  two  interventions:  mass  drug \r\nadministration  (MDA)  and  indoor  residual  spraying  (IRS).  Deployed \r\nsynchronously, or nearly so, they have a strong synergistic effect that enhances \r\nhost  disease  control  well  beyond  the  effects  of  two  individual,  temporally\u00ad\r\nisolated  interventions.  The  pronounced  infection  suppression  established  in  a \r\nshort time scale by an MDA with good coverage is sustained, or augmented by \r\nthe  longer\u00adscale  IRS  campaign.  This  enhanced  control  is  most  prominent  in \r\nhigh\u00adtransmission settings, but  also with modest and somewhat longer lasting \r\ngains in mid\u00adto\u00adlow transmissive areas. We discuss regimes of efficacy and policy \r\nimplications.",
