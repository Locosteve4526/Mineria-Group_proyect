        "Description/Abstract": "A delay partial differential equation (DPDE) is an equation which involves\n\n - at least two independent variables,\n - an unknown function of the independent variables,\n - the behavior of the unknown function at some prior value(s) of the independent variable(s),\n - partial derivative(s) of the unknown function with respect to the independent variable(s). \n\nTherefore, a delay partial differential equation differs from a partial differential equation in that it depends not only on the solution at a present stage but also on the solution at some past stage(s). If, additionally, the equation depends on the derivative(s) of the solution at some past stage(s), then it is a neutral delay partial differential equation.\n\nDelay partial differential equations are also called partial functional differential equations as their unknown solutions are used in these equations as functional arguments.
