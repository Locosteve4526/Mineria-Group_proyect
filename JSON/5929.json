        "Description/Abstract": "Navigating adolescence could be a challenge in its own right, but it is uniquely difficult for urban minority and immigrant girls who are being impacted by the confluence of external circumstances.  This article describes a participatory arts-based study conducted by a women\u2019s research team with ten urban adolescent girls in the Midwest of the United States. The purpose of the study was to illuminate the girls\u2019 visions of their future and their struggles to achieve these visions. The participants were African-American and Latino and African immigrant girls from one school.  The study used Photovoice and other arts-based activities to construct photo-narratives indicating their future visions for themselves, their school and their world. Results of the study are categorized into picturing themselves; and picturing their school and their communities.  The findings of this project reflect tensions in achieving the girls\u2019 future visions.  It also highlights the need for a safe space for the girls to talk and share their thoughts and concerns about issues they face and what they envision for their futures.  It also points to the need for further collaborative partnerships to challenge the obstacles that immigrant and minority girls face, not only in the American educational system, but also within the larger ecologies in which these girls interact. Photovoice and arts-based research provide opportunities to engage in an empowerment discourse not often channeled in other methods. Future work in this partnership will continue to address sociocultural issues identified by the girls in their photo-narratives.",
