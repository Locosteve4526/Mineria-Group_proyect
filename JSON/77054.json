        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;Detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the environment is hampered by the lack of fast and reliable methods of in-field detection. The currently used analytical methods, e.g., liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy, are not field deployable; they are slow and costly, and they require significant sample preparation prior to analysis. A real-time sensor is needed in order to rapidly capture information about PFAS release or presence in a given location, in order to abate environmental exposure. In this work, we demonstrate a semiconductor device, the Environmental Optically Gated Transistor (ENVIR-OGT) for potential identification and quantification of PFAS in liquid samples. The ENVIR-OGT is an optically driven electrochemical sensor which combines a transistor device with signal processing and signal feature analysis to provide real-time chemical detection. Here, we present measurement results for the three PFAS: perfluorooctane, perfluoropentanoic acid\u00a0(PFPeA), and perfluoropropionic acid\u00a0(PFPrA). Each PFAS was measured at two concentrations (in methanol) 10 ppb and 400 ppt. The distinctive features in the electrical response of the ENVIR-OGT in the presence of each chemical indicate that it is likely this device can be used to detect many different PFAS of regulatory interest. \u00a0\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;",
