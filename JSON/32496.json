Hear about different makerspace models of engagement, critical partnerships, and how to develop a maker-type space in your own library. Makerspaces are communities as well as spaces and places. How can we use informal learning techniques, team-based learning, and constructivism to establish powerful makerspaces in our libraries and engage our communities?",
