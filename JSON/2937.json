Additionally, I will address the fourth question, about being online, by examining a number of Waldenfels\u2019 own references to computer media, particularly one occurring in the as-of-yet untranslated text Displacements of place and time: Modes of embodied experience (Ortsverscheibungen, Zeitverscheibungen: Modi leibhafter Erfahrung; 2009).
