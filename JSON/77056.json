        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Of the 5 senses, smell is the most directly intertwined with memory largely due to the unique, fast connection between the nose and the cortex. Airborne particles are detected by receptors in the nose, which transmit this signal directly to areas of the brain important for emotion (such as the amygdala) and memory (such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex). Odors have been shown to evoke more detailed memories and improve performance in memory tests. However, questions remain about how different types of odors may affect memory. One way to distinguish scents is by their complexity: some scents have only one molecule or a few different molecules that contribute to \u201cthe smell\u201d (such as citrus) while others have hundreds (such as coffee). We investigated if scent complexity affected recall memory in college students using a custom-built scent delivery device that attaches to virtual reality headsets. We used diluted essential oils to test if a simple scent (citrus) or a complex scent (coffee) affected recall memory compared to a control, no-scent group. We hypothesized that both scents would improve memory compared to the control group, and that females would perform better than males with scent administration.&lt;/p&gt;",
