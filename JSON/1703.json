        "Description/Abstract": "We consider a natural way of extending the Lebesgue covering dimension  to various classes of infinite dimensional topological groups. The  dimension function that we introduce extends Lebesgue covering  dimension, has the hereditary property, and has a product theory that is  more similar to the product theory for the finite dimensional case.",
