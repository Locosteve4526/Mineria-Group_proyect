        "Description/Abstract": "This article describes counseling in Brazil, which is rooted in career  and vocational guidance. Although considered a distinct discipline,  counseling falls under the umbrella of psychology. The multicultural  movement is gaining momentum in Brazil, and counselors are pioneers  working with socioracial minority college students. This is an emerging  dimension to the professional identity. Some Brazilian universities are  interested in international partnerships that could lead to the  establishment of counseling as an independent profession.",
