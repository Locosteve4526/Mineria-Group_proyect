Or what types of questions you would be asked through SMS reference service? Don\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel! Join Boise State University librarians Amy Vecchione and Margie Ruppel to learn the results from their recently conducted national and local surveys on SMS reference. By attending this session participants will learn the most common types of questions asked through SMS, ways to market this service, best practices for answering SMS reference questions, and patrons\u2019 perceptions of this new reference service. By the end of this presentation you will feel more confident about the best ways to engage your users with SMS reference.",
