        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Naloxone is a critical component in fighting the opioid epidemic, particularly for justice-involved individuals who are at an increased risk of drug-related deaths. However, numerous barriers to carrying the medication continue to exist for individuals under community supervision. Little is known about community supervision officers\u2019 perceptions and knowledge surrounding Naloxone, which is critical in understanding barriers to Naloxone possession for those on supervision. To address this gap in the literature, this exploratory mixed-methods study gathered data through an online survey of community supervision officers (&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span&gt;\u00a0= 109). The findings suggest that while Naloxone is widely known among community supervision officers, there is a need for more consistent training to improve knowledge, address stigmas/misconceptions, and further equip officers to support overdose prevention through harm reduction. Future research on this topic is crucial to help address barriers to distributing and using Naloxone to reduce opioid overdose deaths among those on community supervision.&lt;/span&gt;",
