        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;\u00a0 In this work, we describe three novel memristor types developed and fabricated at the Boise State University Idaho Microfabrication Laboratory. Each memristor type is composed of multiple chalcogenide material layers. All three types of memristors function based on a dual Ag ion conduction in conjunction with phase change operating mechanisms. The difference in the three types is within the multiple chalcogenide material layers. Each memristor type, during the deposition of the chalcogenide layers, is co-sputtered with a different metal (W, Cr, or Sn).\u00a0 Electrical characterization was performed under DC and AC conditions at operating temperatures ranging from room temperature to 140\u2070C. In addition, data retention tests were monitored using the same temperature range. The data retention tests were monitored for a minimum of an hour for multiple devices with some tests also lasting four hours. These tests revealed that the devices display generic memristor characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;",
