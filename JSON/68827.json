        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;This essay is an example of field philosophy. Field philosophy throws itself into a particular issue or case, rather than merely applying theory or entering with abstract notions of the problem. Field philosophy is practiced &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; \u2013 the philosophy is not an abstract dimension of the situation, but is the medium within which the situation occurs. It views philosophy as a lived practice as much as an intellectual endeavor. Reporting on field philosophy will always be understated; the context it is practiced in is too rich \u2013 too saturated \u2013 to fully recognize in spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My case is livestock grazing on a family ranch in Northeastern Nevada. Through the seven years I\u2019ve been working with the ranch, I\u2019ve come to recognize the role of federal land governance in enacting (always imperfectly) varying conceptions of democracy and the ways that structured epistemic projects serve to curate diverging democratic ideals. This is the medium within which my practice occurs. Here, I report on the ways collaboration is enacted, and how adherence to scientific discipline undermines the collaborative landscape. Along the way, readers will learn a bit about public land management and the deep-seated challenges that must be addressed to develop collaborative public land management that puts the &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; back into &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; land.&lt;/p&gt;",
