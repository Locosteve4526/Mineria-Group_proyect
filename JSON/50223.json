        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\u2014In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we present\nthe results of adopting Team-Based Learning (TBL) for teaching\na Sophomore-level Systems Programming course. The goal of\nTBL is to \u201cprovide opportunities for students to apply their\nknowledge in the classroom to solve problems rather than just\ncovering content.\u201d Based on the performance of the students\nin the course taught with TBL, we found that TBL had a\nstatistically significant impact on student performance in 2 of the\n5 programming assignments. Additionally, the end-of-semester\nstudent survey indicated that 88% of the students said that\nthe team-based learning activities helped them understand the\nmaterial better. Students mentioned that they felt like they\nbelonged in Computer Science (fostering a sense of community in\nlarge classrooms) and frequently studied with some of their team\nmembers for the course assignments. Compared to a previous\noffering of the course that was purely lecture-based, the class as\na whole received higher final grades and performed better on all\nof the programming assignments.\nIndex Terms\u2014active learning, team-based learning, flipped\nclassrooms, student engagement",
