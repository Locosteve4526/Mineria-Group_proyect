        "Description/Abstract": "This article discusses an action research study of a week-long Summer Teachers Institute which immersed teachers in the study of Jewish historical and cultural texts. We investigate how this kind of cultural immersion created opportunities for transformative learning \u2013 the kind of learning that would not merely be the application of \u201cnew lessons,\u201d but that would also help teachers reconceptualize their teaching practices regarding Jewish religion and culture. Our findings suggest that text study practices of challenging \u2013 in tandem with practices of supporting and voicing \u2013 were central in constructing a \u201crelational learning community.\u201d Such a community was a necessary condition for transformative learning.",
