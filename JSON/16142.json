This session will take the mystery out of Special Collections and Archives. Cheryl will provide an overview of patrons, topics, and services from start to finish. She'll cover rules, copyright issues, virtual reference, photocopies, scans, digital cameras, preparations, forms, retrieval, props, confidentiality, and monitoring as well as what statistics are gathered and how they're used.",
