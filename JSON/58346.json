        "Description/Abstract": "In 2016, the Idaho State Legislature amended the Local Land Use Planning Act to prohibit counties and cities from banning short-term rentals (STR\u2019s) except to \u201csafeguard the public health, safety and general welfare in order to protect the integrity of residential neighborhoods\u201d. Since that time, Idaho communities have responded with a variety of new zoning provisions that restrict, but not prohibit STRs. But what happens to cities and neighborhoods when long-term housing is converted to short-term rentals, and when neighbors are replaced by \u201cguests\u201d? This presentation addresses the rise of STRs in the global capitals and tourist destinations where they are typically studied, as well as here in Idaho, examining how STRs impact housing markets, neighborhood character, and community building.",
