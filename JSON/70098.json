The presence of Great Horned Owls on five of the twenty cameras placed on Northern Aplomado Falcon nest structures led us to consider the impact this interaction may have on occupancy and productivity of the nests. Throughout the study system, fast-growing tree and shrub species have become more prominent, which could be facilitating the interaction. We hypothesize that encroachment of woody vegetation is drawing Great Horned Owls into the open coastal grassland habitat of Northern Aplomado Falcons, which may limit the occupancy and productivity of falcon nests. Based on this hypothesis from the camera trap observations and anecdotal evidence of habitat encroachment, quantifying this relationship is a key next step in the recovery process. This will enable us to define priority areas for targeted restoration to push back woody vegetation, as well as areas best suited to release Northern Aplomado Falcons that will minimize the likelihood of predation by Great Horned Owls.&lt;/span&gt;",
