        "Description/Abstract": "The lecture has been much maligned as a pedagogical form. It has been denigrated as a \u201chot medium\u201d to be \u201csuperseded\u201d by the cooler dialogical and televisual forms (McLuhan, 1964, p. 256), or as an \u201coral residue\u201d in an age of proliferating digital information (Jones, 2007), or. Yet the lecture persists and even flourishes today in the form of the podcast, the TED Talk, and the \u201csmart\u201d lecture hall (outfitted with audio, video and student feedback technologies). This persistence provides an opportunity to re-evaluate both the lecture and the status of the media related to it through an analysis of its form and function over time. This paper examines the lecture as a pedagogical genre, as \u201ca site where differences between media are negotiated\u201d as these media co-evolve (Franzel, 2010). This examination shows the lecture as bridging oral communication with writing and newer media technologies, rather than as being superseded by newer electronic and digital forms. The result is a remarkably adaptable and robust form that combines textual record and ephemeral event, and that is capable of addressing a range of different demands and circumstances, both practical and epistemological. The Web, which brings together multiple media with new and established forms and genres, presents fertile grounds for the continuation and revitalization of the lecture as a dominant pedagogical form.",
