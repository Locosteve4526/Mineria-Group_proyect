        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;In technical communication, food offers opportunities to bridge technical genres with conversations about gender, race/ethnicity, and identity. Recent scholarship has examined cookbooks that counter messages that gender equality has been achieved (Moeller and Frost, 2016), highlight decolonizing efforts (Thielen, 2022), or question the use of \u201cdecolonial\u201d to describe urban foraging (Itchuaqiyaq &amp; Matheson, 2021). Food writing represents conversations about what it means to comply in food spaces, whether through performances of femininity (or resistance) or engaging with healthism (Hanganu-Bresch, 2021) or disrupting colonial ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;In this presentation, we (a faculty member and student) share experiences from a class focused on food rhetorics and technical communication, a class built in many ways to explore what it means to comply with genres but also to examine modes of being. After the faculty member frames the course context, the student will share her experiences. She will discuss her experience of exploring decolonized cooking and her Latina identity and how decolonized cooking became another area of compliance as it imposed restrictions on what tools were necessary and what food was permitted. Simultaneously, she also experienced fewer restrictions on assignments, which allowed her to explore her identity within technical communication genres.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;We will conclude with takeaways for teaching and learning, highlighting the ways this class disrupted narrower definitions of technical communication and compliance to teacher-imposed assignments. Because this course also explored issues of identity, students were able to bring a more critical lens to everyday genres to take beyond the course. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
