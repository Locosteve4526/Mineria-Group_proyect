        "Description/Abstract": "In 2016, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he would be joining the National Science Foundation and Gates Foundations in spending hundreds of millions of dollars to support the development of technologies for \u201cpersonalized learning.\u201d These technologies promise to provide learners or users with interactive content that is tailored with precision to their preferences and previous behaviors\u2014much like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed does. However, in recent months, Silicon Valley defectors and some education technologists have warned that these technologies enact a form of Skinnerian operant conditioning. First explaining how this \u201cnew behaviorism\u201d is instantiated in personalized learning technology, this paper then argues that such an approach is antithetical to the most basic priorities and purposes of education.",
