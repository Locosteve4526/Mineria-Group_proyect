Differential-functional\tinequalities Dxz(x, y) ? f(x, y, z(x, y), z, Dyz(x, y)) = P[z](x,y) ? 0, (x,y) ? IntE, are considered, where Dyz = (Dy1z,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,Dynz) and z denotes an element of the space of continuous functions from E0 ? E to R. We prove the following result. Suppose that P[u](x,y) ? 0 and P[v](x,y) ? 0 on IntE. If u(x,y) ? v(x,y) on the initial set E0 then under certain conditions concerning f and E we have u(x, y) ? v(x, y) on E. Our result is a generalization of previous results on first-order partial differential or differential-functional inequalities. It is an essential fact in our considerations that f satisfies the Volterra condition and that it is nondecreasing with respect to the functional argument.",
