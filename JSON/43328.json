        "Description/Abstract": "While much attention in both the media and journals is directed towards the rankings of criminal justice and criminology PhD programs, little is known about factors relating to student application decisions regarding their program of choice. Currently, nothing exists in the literature examining what factors masters level graduate directors consider in their recommendations to graduate students in terms of PhD selection. This study serves to fill that hole in the literature and provide a better understanding of this influential role in students' PhD program decisions via a survey of graduate directors at masters only granting departments in criminal justice and criminology.",
