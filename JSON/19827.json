        "Description/Abstract": "A survey of 150 human resource (HR) professionals from eight Society for Human Resource Management chapters in North Texas revealed organizational non-discrimination policies and benefits available to married employees and employees with unmarried partners.  The results indicated that about thirty percent of respondents reported sexual orientation in their policies.  About twelve percent of respondents reported their organizations providing health/medical insurance to same-sex domestic partners.  Company affidavits signed by both partners were the most common proofs of relationship in companies that provided same-sex couple benefits.  Implications for future research were highlighted.",
