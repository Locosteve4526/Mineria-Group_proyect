        "Description/Abstract": "This book consists of several survey and research papers covering a wide range of topics in active areas of set theory and set theoretic topology. Some of the articles present, for the first time in print, knowledge that has been around for several years and known intimately to only a few experts. The surveys bring the reader up to date on the latest information in several areas that have been surveyed a decade or more ago. Topics covered in the volume include combinatorial and descriptive set theory, determinacy, iterated forcing, Ramsey theory, selection principles, set-theoretic topology, and universality, among others. Graduate students and researchers in logic, especially set theory, descriptive set theory, and set-theoretic topology, will find this book to be a very valuable reference.",
