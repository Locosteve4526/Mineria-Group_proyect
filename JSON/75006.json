        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;This IUSE project focuses on the development, implementation, and evaluation of the impact of a unique storytelling intervention to enhance the self-view of undergraduate engineering students. It explores how telling personal narratives about oneself affects students' engineering professional identity, sense of belonging, and persistence in the major. Collaborating with the non-profit organization The Story Collider and funded by an NSF grant (award# 2142137), the research uses a design-based mixed-methods approach to investigate the impact of storytelling on undergraduate engineering students. Incorporated into engineering courses, this intervention targets students during their sophomore year with the goal to develop and refine open-source curricular materials focused on teaching storytelling skills to engineering students. Each iteration of the intervention spans a semester, and involves personal narrative development supported by producers from The Story Collider. The research addresses three key questions:(1) What are the thematic and structural characteristics of personal narratives written by students about their experiences in engineering education?;(2) How does students\u2019 development and performance of a personal narrative about their experiences in engineering education relate to their professional engineering identity, sense of belonging in the major, and downstream persistence?;(3) How do the thematic and structural characteristics of personal narratives written by students about their experiences in engineering education relate to their professional engineering identity, sense of belonging in the major, and downstream\u00a0\u2026&lt;/span&gt;",
