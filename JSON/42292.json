        "Description/Abstract": "Undergraduate research opportunities have expanded from elite universities in the United States to universities and institutions of all ranks and sizes. Research studies have shown positive outcomes in regards to the research\nexperience for undergraduates (REU), such as enhanced research skills and competencies. However, with the widespread implementation of REU programs across the country, there are some challenging issues, such as fierce competition among students for limited participation opportunities and underrepresented students\u2019 needs commonly being overlooked. This study reported a three-year, nine-week REU Site program in cybersecurity designed for underrepresented students (women and minorities) and participants from institutions with limited research opportunities. Results showed that most participants enjoyed the opportunity to work on a real-world project which afforded them research experience in the REU program as it helped participants improve various research skills. The study contributes to the design of REU programs for underrepresented students and students with limited research opportunities. Recommendations for future REU programs are discussed.",
