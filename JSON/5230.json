        "Description/Abstract": "1.?Insect herbivory directed at flowers can decrease fruit and seed production by decreasing the attractiveness of a damaged flower to potential pollinators, by disrupting the transfer of pollen between pollinators and stigmas, or both.\n2.?Effects of petal herbivory by a chrysomelid beetle (Phyllotreta sp.) on pollination and seed production in Lepidium papilliferum (Brassicaceae) were examined.\n3.?Under natural conditions, flowers with a hole chewed in a petal produced fruit and seed at a significantly lower rate than undamaged flowers (44% vs. 80% respectively). However, when damaged and undamaged flowers were hand pollinated, there was no significant difference in fruit or seed set (84% vs. 80% respectively).\n4.?Petal herbivory in L. papilliferum disrupts the effectiveness of insect-mediated pollination, but it does not physically inhibit pollination or seed production.",
