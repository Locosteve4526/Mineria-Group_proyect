Scholarship has long focused on the novel’s “wilderness” setting, but only recently have scholars begun to approach Edgar Huntly from an explicitly ecocritical perspective. This essay builds on existing scholarship to address Brown’s novel through the dual lenses of ecocriticism and Gothic studies, examining its representations of place, landscape, and psychology, emphasizing its engagement with anxieties about humanity and animality. 
Until now, the term “ecogothic” has been insufficiently defined; this essay approaches this term understanding the Gothic as a mode (building on the work of Jerrold Hogle and Teresa Goddu) to show how Gothic moments in texts can be read ecocritically. The explicitly Gothic moments in Edgar Huntly depict cultural anxieties not just about “wilderness,” but also about the slippery divide between humanity and animality. Amid all the threats that Huntly encounters, none are more unsettling than realizing that the boundaries between the human and more-than-human world are penetrable and unstable—and may be entirely social constructions. Textually, the novel blurs boundaries between the Delaware Indians, “savage” panthers, and the sleepwalking Clithero Edny, and eventually Huntly finds himself part of this elision of categories—where “human” and “animal” collapse. In Huntly’s transformation, we see playing out Stacy Alaimo’s new materialist concept that “the human is always intermeshed with the more-than-human world,” and that “the substance of the human is ultimately inseparable from ‘the environment’” (2). This reading of Edgar Huntly, finally, shows how the idea of the body as nature, as environment, is a specter that haunts the otherwise rational, enlightened late-eighteenth-century subject.

County government is the one form of government that touches all parts of the Great Basin territory.  Based upon a centuries old model of independently elected citizen officials, county governments in the Great Basin face multiple challenges in providing services across such great expanses.  Rural counties such as those in the Great Basin are in large part dependent upon federal paybacks and Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILTs), yet the region has a strong tradition of resistance to big government.  The chapter describes the limitations of financial dependence upon federal land management agency payments, property tax limits imposed by citizens and legislatures and the lack of capacity to meet these challenges among Great Basin county governments.

Oregon voters have considered two different measures, one in 1992 (Measure 13) and one in 1994 (Measure 9). With the exception of Colorado's 1992 vote on Amendment Two, all of the statewide anti-gay initiatives have failed at the ballot box. Colorado's Amendment Two was later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court (see Chapter 11). Table A. 11 displays the election results for the four statewide votes considered in this chapter. This analysis uses county-level data to evaluate the votes on four of these anti-gay initiatives (the 1992 Oregon initiative is not used).
The literature on public opinion and attitudes towards gays suggests that certain voter characteristics correlate with tolerance toward gays. An important empirical question is whether or not voters take those predispositions with them into the voting booth when considering anti-gay initiatives. By comparing socioeconomic, political, and religious characteristics of county populations with the county's vote on the anti-gay measure, we can begin to assess the relationship between tolerance and this divisive social issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,127-132,,,,,Anti-Gay Rights: Assessing Voter Initiatives, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/pubadmin_facpubs/18,,[],"[{""id"": 23368, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 1997, ""termid"": ""1996/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Witt, S.

Joe Johnston's army for control over Northern Georgia. Neither side had set out to destroy the landscape. The devastation was instead the unavoidable result of armies in motion and one of the inevitable costs of war. Five months later, however, Sherman implemented a strategy, derived from an ancient form of warfare, that shifted devastation from an unintended, haphazard consequence of war into a deliberate and organized weapon of war.

To find answers to these questions, after a brief introduction and literature summary, I put forth in this chapter a measure of globalization based on an operational definition of it laid out in the opening chapter of this volume. I then subject the measure to statistical test to ascertain more precisely whether or not it is an influential factor in enhancing or retarding development. The focus of the tests will be on explaining, through multivariate modeling, variance in two competing conceptions and measurements of developing: economic (the more traditional approach), and human (a more current view that is quickly gaining adherents) as embodies in the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,34-55,,,,,Coping with Globalization: Cross-National Patterns in Domestic Governance and Policy Performance, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/polsci_facpubs/13,,[],"[{""id"": 24096, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2002, ""termid"": ""2001/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Burkhart, R.

Fandoms (specific fan subcultures) develop language and vernaculars, name themselves and their subgroups, create social structures and determine accepted, expected behaviors that reflect their shared values and meanings. Cultural assumptions are revealed through values, myths and understandings embedded in a fandom’s language and stories. The Supernatural Family exemplifies how storytelling creates cultural myths, which then become part of the fandom’s culture and identity. The SPN Family reflects the values expressed in the program through the stories they share. Narratives of family belonging, taking care of their own, fighting the good fight, unity and strength, and unwavering loyalty create a mythic Winchester-esque dynamic. Being part of the Family opens the door to a life where “what would a Winchester do” seems the unspoken motto.

Based on the tweet analysis, we found that the students appropriately applied the design principles and design terms in their critique of design examples. While the students were mainly engaged in assignment-relevant activities, they spontaneously generated social tweets as they related peers’ authentic design examples to their own life experiences. Overall, they had positive perceptions toward the mobile microblogging activities. The students also indicated that the design examples shared by peers through mobile microblogging inspired their own message design work.

The administrational aspects of the project, such as how courses were selected and how faculty members were recruited, are briefly described. The assessment, which includes data on faculty and students perceptions as well as student performance and course success, is described in detail. Finally, a case study of a particularly successful course provides a detailed view of best practices for teaching in a blended environment.

Levidow (2000) describes the central features of neoliberalism as ""efficiency as progress,"" ""commodification,"" and ""globalization"". But, when we look at these three central features applied to education, the efficiency is efficiency of transmission of this commodified knowledge. Globalization, as it applies to education, involves privatization so the free-market pressures can finance the transmission of this commodified knowledge. The commodified knowledge claimed to be objective turns out to merely support a neoliberal worldview, nothing else. Uncommodified, how could knowledge be transmitted and tested efficiently?

24592,112176072,112176072,,2011.0,,,,,,Electromagnetic Waves in Contaminated Soils,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil is a complex, potentially heterogeneous, lossy, and dispersive medium. Modeling the propagation and scattering of electromagnetic (EM) waves in soil is, hence, more challenging than in air or in other less complex media. This chapter will explain fundamentals of the numerical modeling of EM wave propagation and scattering in soil through solving Maxwell's equations using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The chapter will explain how: (i) the lossy and dispersive soil medium (in both dry and fully water-saturated conditions), (ii) a fourth phase (anomaly), (iii) two different types of transmitting antennae (a monopole and a dipole), and (iv) required absorbing boundary conditions can numerically be modeled. This is described through two examples that simulate the detection of DNAPL (dense nonaqueous-phase liquid) contamination in soil using Cross-well radar (CWR). CWR —otherwise known as cross-borehole GPR (ground penetrating radar)—modality was selected to eliminate the need for simulation of the roughness of the soil-air interface. The two examples demonstrate the scattering effect of a dielectric anomaly (representing a DNAPL pool) on the EM wave propagation through soil. The objective behind selecting these two examples is twofold: (i) explanation of the details and challenges of numerical modeling of EM wave propagation and scattering through soil for an actual problem (in this case, DNAPL detection), and (ii) demonstration of the feasibility of using EM waves for this actual detection problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Electromagnetic Waves Propagation in Complex Matter, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/civileng_facpubs/22,,[],"[{""id"": 24592, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2011/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Farid, A.', 'Alshawabkeh, A.

Proteins serve diverse roles such as transport carriers, catalysts, molecular motors, cellular structural support, and others that make life possible. Because of these widely differing roles, proteins have an enormously diverse set of shapes, sizes, and charge structures as compared to polynucleic acids. Solid-state nanopores are particularly suitable for characterizing single protein molecules because they can be fabricated with adjustable dimensions and are stable under conditions that denature proteins. This chapter describes the nanopore experimental setup, signal recording, data analysis, and basic principles related to the experiments and the theory connecting the electrical signal with the properties of proteins. Examples of experimental results illustrate the ability of solid-state nanopores to differentiate proteins in their folded and unfolded states. Native-state protein nanopore translocation follows biased one-dimensional diffusion of charged particles that is sensitive to size and electrical charge. Due to the heterogeneous charge sequence of polypeptides, unfolded proteins obey a coupled electrophoretic and thermally activated process that is sequence specific. The chapter concludes with a discussion of future directions and open challenges for single protein characterization using solid-state nanopores.",978-1-4419-8251-3,2011,,,,,10.1007/978-1-4419-8252-0_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,129-150,,,,,Springer US, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 24608, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Ledden, B.', 'Fologea, D.', 'David, T.

As Martin Jay points out, the metaphor of the constellation also travelled from Benjamin via Theodore Adorno to America and back to Europe, to re-emerge in Adorno’s postwar writings while he was at the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. As Jay explains, in the context of this exchange, the term constellation signified “a juxtaposed rather than integrated cluster of changing elements that resist reduction to a common denominator, essential core, or generative first principle” (1984, pp. 14-15).

These issues include the development of technical media that were profoundly reshaping nearly all aspects of everyday reality in Dewey’s time.

It is therefore surprising how rarely instructional theories, methods and applications –e.g., learning theories learning designs or learning environments ? are considered specifically as technologies in the relevant literature. This chapter focuses on the instrumental nature of the concept ‘learning’ and learning theory, which Gert Biesta and others have characterized as being manifest in a ‘new language of learning.’ This refers to a vocabulary or discourse that, for example, characterizes ‘‘teaching’ [as the] ‘facilitation of learning’ [and], ‘education’ [as the] ‘provision of learning opportunities’’ (Haugsbak & Nordkvelle, 2007,  p. 2). The paper argues that this vocabulary represents a particular technologization or instrumentalization of education, a process that makes educational practices and priorities appear germane to, or even incomplete without, technological rationalization and reshaping. This paper traces how this vocabulary casts learning as a natural and universal process, and quite consistently accompanies the promotion of a range of technological artifacts in education. Running from the introduction of ‘teaching machines’ through to current visions of school reform, this theoretical lexicon will be shown to efface its cultural and ideological contingency through a quasi?scientific ‘neutrality’ and a biologically?based universality, and to limit the possibility for educational discourse and practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://learningspaces.org/papers/langoflearning.pdf,,[],"[{""id"": 24662, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2013, ""termid"": ""2013/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Friesen, N.']"

able to have the ability to “copy,” “distribute” and “improve” software, and to 
be able to “exchange the changes with others” (Stallman 1986, p. 8). These four

The prototype design includes a flexible fabric “skirt” which is attached to the frame of a standard facemask. The interface adapts easily to the contours of the face and provides increased contact area with the skin. The performance of the prototype facemask was compared to the performance of a standard facemask using a manikin. Air pressure and volume airflow through the masks were controlled. The results showed that the flow and pressure characteristics of the prototype facemask including the skirt interface were comparable to those of the standard facemask technology. The prototype reduced the facemask pressure levels on the face by allowing the interface skirt to “float” on the skin. ,9.78144E+12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,353-360,,,,,CRC Press, USA,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://www.crcpress.com/,,[],"[{""id"": 24806, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2012/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Reischl, U.', 'Ashworth, L.

Moenssens,,,Wiley Encyclopedia of Forensic Science,Deception detection,,,,,,,,,,,"Deception detection is an important task in forensics and security. Criminals and terrorists are highly motivated to deceive, and people are not good in detecting deception without technological assistance. Traditional approaches to assist in the deception detection task have made use of physiological cues measured from the suspect in a controlled environment. To date, only the polygraph has achieved widespread application in forensics. Although there is controversy, research suggests that in forensic settings the polygraph is about 90% accurate in discriminating truth-tellers from deceivers. This is a considerable improvement over naďve deception detection. Research has examined other physiological measures. Voice stress analysis, although used in forensics, is without demonstrated scientific validity. Recent research suggests that ocular-motor measures may be able to provide high validity deception detection even in screening settings.

Deception is a ubiquitous human behavior.  DePaulo and her colleagues (DePaulo & Kashy, 1998; DePaulo, Kashy, Kirkendol, Wyer, & Epstein, 1996; Kashy & Depaulo, 1996) studied deception in naturalistic settings and found that during interpersonal interactions of 10 minutes or longer, people lied on average twice a day.  Deception is used in quarter of interactions with others, and on average, a person lies to 34% of the people interacted with during an average week.

Based on the tweet analysis, we found that the students appropriately applied the design principles and design terms in their critique of design examples. While the students were mainly engaged in assignment-relevant activities, they spontaneously generated social tweets as they related peers’ authentic design examples to their own life experiences. Overall, they had positive perceptions toward the mobile microblogging activities. The students also indicated that the design examples shared by peers through mobile microblogging inspired their own message design work.

While social networking has been important and in practice in our society even before human civilization and certainly prior to the advent of computers, nowadays, the opportunities and venues of building a network are unprecedented. Currently, the opportunities and tools to build a network to support personal and professional learning are enabled by mobile technologies (e.g., mobile apps, devices, and services), web-based applications (e.g., Diigo and RSS readers), and social-networking applications and services (e.g., Facebook, Google+, and Twitter). The purpose of this chapter is to describe and propose how individuals use personal learning environments (PLEs), personal learning networks (PLNs), and professional learning networks (ProLNs) with mobile technologies and social networking tools to meet their daily learning needs. In our chapter, we consider categories of learning relevant to personal learning and professional learning, then we define and examine PLEs, PLNs, and ProLNs, suggesting how mobile devices and social software can be used within these. The specific strategies learners use within PLEs, PLNs, and ProLNs are then presented followed by cases that depict and exemplify these strategies within the categories of learning. Finally, implications for using mobile devices to support personal and professional learning are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,27-46,,,,,Nova Science Publishers, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,10,,,[],"[{""id"": 25113, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Grant, M.

One important domain of academic language use, however, has yet to be fully explored from a corpus-based perspective: textual borrowing. Though it is widely recognized that much of what we write in the academy is in some way based upon what has been written before, little is known about when, how often, and in what ways academic writers re-use the language of others. In this paper, I describe my own attempts to provide corpus-based descriptions of student paraphrasing, I highlight the ways in which this research has challenged assumptions about student source text use, and I outline possible directions for future textual borrowing research.

In many nations, police officers were to “police by mutual consent” with the public but often did not experience mutual confidence between senior officers and the rank and file. They needed a satisfactory outlet for their grievances, an advocate to protect their interests, and input into their occupation. A union could hinder arbitrary power from above, but authorities worried that unions undermined the organization. However, officers without an authorized union worked at the mercy of superior authorities and were more prone to strike. 

The earliest organizing efforts in nineteenth century Europe, America, and Australia aimed not only at pay, pensions, and regular days off, but also at the “right to confer.” They insisted that officers had the right to be consulted by police authorities on policy and conditions of service. Much of western Europe, Scandinavia, and Australia moved toward legalizing police unions during the early twentieth century. However, they remained prohibited in Britain and America.  World War One put the police under immense economic and work stress, ending in strikes in Cape Town, London, Liverpool, and Boston. After 2 years with strikes, the British government responded by creating a police federation and with a comprehensive Police Act (1919). The United States went in the opposite direction, banning unions into the 1950s.  American police had to rely on mutual aid and fraternal organizations to protect their interests. This adversarial attitude
toward police unions persisted well after the unions began to be legalized after World War Two.

The Civil Rights era revived existing and new police unions in response to calls for reform and integration. Police union rights were linked to broader organizing rights. While still concerned with pay and conditions, unions began lobbying
policy makers to improve internal conditions and address external issues. They used a variety of strategies, both old and modern. “Work to rule” and slowdowns continued. Media campaigns won over public and political support. This created
concerns that unions were threatening police political neutrality, particularly after scandals where police unions and party leaders made secret deals promising support in return for specific policies. Recently, more positive directions for police unions included working for affirmative action across the African continent, and pioneering shared leadership programs in the United States. Challenges for police unions persisted. They earned a reputation for being reactionary and inflexible, though unions took steps toward cooperating in reforms and community issues in constructive ways. Research on police unions is sparse, and mostly focuses on recent decades. Scholars tend to have pessimistic assessments, but lately have explored linkages between workplace rights and civil rights. The picture, however, remains incomplete. (6500 words)

While the British government considered their appeals for reform, the Protestant-controlled Northern Irish government banned civil rights marches and insisted that Catholics had no cause for complaint. This provoked violent clashes between Catholic marchers and the predominantly Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Protestant extremists began setting off bombs in Catholic neighborhoods and Catholic extremists retaliated; both sides launched into campaigns of bombing, assassination, and assault hoping to drive each other out of the region. In 1969, the British sent in the army to end the chaos since the partisan RUC was clearly part of the problem. However, the presence of the army instead intensified the climate of civil war.

Its primary cornerstone remained a police constable walking the beat. However, appearances were misleading. The growing demands of managing traffic siphoned men away from beats who were not replaced by city authorities eager to save money. The significantly fewer constables left patrolling beats covered expanded territory to make up for men assigned to traffic duties. At the same time, the public came to assume that constables were responsible for providing first aid, retrieving lost property, and other service duties not associated with deterring crime.

Readers should consider assessment as a specialized area of research which seeks to measure of student learning. Assessment is more akin to action research, where the purpose of the research is to inform and improve self-practice. The typical steps in action research are to plan, act, observe, and reflect.

Gittell,,,Sociology of Organizations: Structures and Relationships,Tweeting the Night Away: Using Twitter to Enhance Social Presence,,,,,,,,,,,"Many online educators tend to design the scope, structure, and function of an online course based on the tools available within a learning management system (LMS); that is, an LMS (eg. eCollege, Blackboard, WebCT, Moodle) can constrain how online educators design and develop their online courses (Lane, 2007; Morgan, 2003; Siemens, 2006). While adequate for some basic learning activities (e.g., information and document sharing, asynchronous and synchronous discussion, and assessment via quizzes), LMSs are modeled after classroom settings with drop boxes, grade books, announcements, and so on. What tends to be missing is the just-in-time, and sometimes playful, interactions that happen before and after class, during a break, and when students and faculty bump into each other between class meetings. Out-of-the-classroom interactions like these and many others have potential instructional value (Kuh, 1995) and can help strengthen interpersonal relationships between and among students and faculty that enhance the learning community inside the classroom.
In this teaching tip, we describe our use of Twitter (2009)--a Web 2.0 microblogging tool--to enhance social presence in an online course by providing a mechanism for just-in-time social interactions. We also touch on some other instructional benefits of using Twitter in online courses and conclude with guidelines to consider when using Twitter with students.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,687-695,,,,,Sage,"Los Angeles, CA",,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/edtech_facpubs/39,,[],"[{""id"": 25810, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2011/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Dunlap, J.', 'Lowenthal, P.

The wild woman archetype situated noblewomen as Amazons: women warriors, hunters, and political strong women who possessed exceptional powers enabling them to hunt wild animals, lead armies in uprisings, and act heroically. Analyzing the memoirs, diaries, songs, and poetry of this period, the author concludes that the noblemen of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth promoted the wild woman archetype as a cultural site of the unifying myth of the ""Sarmatian"" origin of nobility. The archetype was rooted in a specific, visible reality -- women were sighted hunting, commanding, and displaying heroism -- though their achievements were framed by men. The author characterizes the wild woman archetype not as a misogynistic discourse meant to marginalize strong women who might challenge patriarchal authority, but rather as one aspect of as ideology underlining the bravery, exceptional nature, and strength of the nobility of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,183-194,,,,,Women As Sites of Culture, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/history_facpubs/42,,[],"[{""id"": 25820, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2002, ""termid"": ""2002/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Lubamersky, L.

A succession of controversies, allegations, investigations, and exposés have pelted away at the base onto which Bag Mac and Slammin' Sammy have been hoisted during the feel-good 1998 session. This chapter will explore the elevation of Sosa and McGwire during the 1998 season and the subsequent denigration of the two players' reputations. Although these two men shared the spotlight during the home run chase and have since had their sporting achievements tainted by similar allegations of steroid use, the discourses surrounding them have diverged in significant ways. During the 1998 season, for example, McGwire was exalted as a father, a family man, and an advocate for child abuse prevention, while Sosa was routinely highlighted for his comedic persona, good-natured relationship with the press, and devotion to his mother in the Dominican Republic. When confronted with suspicions of steroid use in the ensuing years, both men suffered a loss of voice -- a loss featured prominently in mainstream media. Yet this loss of voice generated different meanings for each player. A collective disappointment in McGwire registered in media coverage of the steroid speculation and investigations, while derision and disdain dominated many reports about Sosa. I explore the relationship between their loss of voice and masculinity, race, power and privilege. An analysis of mainstream media coverage shows that similar to the home run chase, media discourse concerning the suspicion of illegal performance-enhancing drugs highlighted Sosa's racial identity, while McGwire's racial identity remained unnamed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,61-75,,,,,"Fame to Infamy: Race, Sport, and the Fall from Grace", ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/kinesiology_facpubs/43,,[],"[{""id"": 25828, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2010, ""termid"": ""2009/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Lucas, S.

A contest was held to determine who would push the button and send the stacks plummeting to the ground. Lining the freeway, front porches, and rooftops of the denuded hillsides were thousands of people who came to watch the spectacle. Among them were two important factions in the community: One faction comprised those who were there to cheer the destruction of the corporate and industrial symbol that to many of the mining and union families of the Coeur d'Alenes, represented a union-busting, corporate form of greed and callousness toward human life that had characterized this valley since the latter part of the nineteenth century. The other group represented at the ""Blow the Stacks"" rally had lobbied hard to keep the EPA and the state from going through with their plans. This group, made up of chamber of commerce activists, preservationists, and business people who rely heavily upon the tourist trade, wanted to preserve the still-carcinogenic stacks so that they could be turned into an interpretive site for tourists. They sought the establishment of a landmark that would portray the positive aspects of the mining industry in the Silver Valley. The button was pushed; the stacks were blown and buried where they fell. A chapter in the history of this contested landscape is closed, while the cultural issues dividing the community continue.
My goal in this discussion is to examine in some detail the origin, development, and current disposition of the opposing cultural perspectives outlined above.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,211-226,,,,,Worldviews and  the American West: The Life of the Place Itself, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/sociology_facpubs/23,,[],"[{""id"": 25930, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2000, ""termid"": ""1999/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['McCarl, R.

Alternatively, historians laud Cary’s life choices as heroic among Catholic recusants. This essay embarks in a new direction, interweaving Elizabeth Cary’s writings with the correspondence of other members of the Cary family to investigate how intersections between faith and gender inspired Cary’s writings and actions. Cary’s experience offers insights into the struggles of other English Catholic women who faced irreconcilable conflicts between the fulfillment of feminine social roles and defense of religious beliefs. Such Catholics unintentionally participated in re-negotiating rules dictating appropriate masculine and feminine behavior, revealing a process by which religious conflict interacted with evolving gender roles in the volatile environment of Reformation England, changing both.",9.78114E+12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,26,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 25932, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2014, ""termid"": ""2014/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['McClain, L.']"

In the domain of global earthquake seismology, the search for solutions in the complex plane began in the vicinity of the elastic solutions. In the case of near-surface engineering work, damping levels can be large, and elastic stiffness can be much less than in global seismology. Furthermore, the choice of representation should depend on the permeability and degree of water saturation. The study of dry or impermeable soils and rock, where viscous effects are largely absent, has led to an alternative representation for the Kelvin-Voigt damping property. Under that alternative of effective viscosity, the damping ratio is a frequency-independent soil constant. Permeable, water-saturated soils, on the other hand, have shown viscous behavior. A method to solve for Love waves can be used under a truly viscous assumption. Applications would include near-surface remote sensing of either water content or permeability.",,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.9781560802259.ch16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,263-278,,,,,Advances in Near-Surface Seismology and Ground-penetrating Radar, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/cgiss_facpubs/146,,[],"[{""id"": 26004, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2010, ""termid"": ""2009/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Michaels, P.', 'Gottumukkula, V.']"

Adam Michnik, ??Václav Havel, and many others left an uplifting imprint on an era that witnessed the emergence of their inspiring progeny, including flying universities, the notion of ""living in truth"", KOR, and Charter 77. In Yugoslavia, intellectuals were as prominent and as influential as their counterparts elsewhere in Eastern Europe, but the results of their engagement were radically different. Whereas the new civil societies of East-Central Europe were built on a foundation of human rights, tolerance, and indifference to ideology,1 intellectual engagement in Yugoslavia produced nationalisms that ranged from the relatively more civic-minded Slovenian variant to the exclusive and intolerant movements on Serbia and Croatia. The lasting images of the work of Yugoslav intellectuals may well be the sieges of Vukovar and Sarajevo, the flight of a quarter of a million Serbs from Croatia in a couple of weeks in the summer of 1995, and the bone fields of eastern Bosnia, which are far different images than those bequeathed by KOR or Charter 77.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,179-200,,,,,State Collapse in South-Eastern Europe: New Perspectives on Yugoslavia's Disintegration, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/history_facpubs/19,,[],"[{""id"": 26028, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2008, ""termid"": ""2007/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Miller, N.

The group,1 founded by the small city of Erfurt in the German state of Thuringia by ambitious dissident Gabriele Stötzer,2 began without high expectations of rebellion, and yet eventually grew into a performance art collaborative that focused on self-expression and social disruption. Before creating their performances, Stötzer and these women expressed themselves through paintings, weavings, photography, pottery, amateur 8mm films, and sewing clothes. By 1991 they founded a space, the Kunsthaus Erfurt (Art House Erfurt), for contemporary art exhibits, workshops and studio spaces.

Examples of the desired symbolic capital include honor, prestige, and having a voice to which others listen, and the sought-after social capital consists of networks, reciprocal connections, and trust.2 But this analysis also leads to Franck's more complex and subtle critique of post-Wende  indifference to Vergangenheitsbewältigung, or coming to terms with the past, which one finds in two narrators' offhand, almost unremarked (but quite remarkable) references to Germany's past.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,237-252,,,,,"German Literature in a New Century: Trends, Traditions, Transitions, Transformations", ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/lang_facpubs/28,,[],"[{""id"": 26296, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2008, ""termid"": ""2007/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Norman, B.

Yet that act of private commemoration prompted a major creative impulse that produced the 45-poem ""Calamus"" cluster, thematically devoted to male comradeship, and his combination of old and new poems that would make up ""Children of Adam"" (originally ""Enfans d'Adam), devoted to sex, procreation, and love of men for women. Whereas both of the larger clusters were printed in the third (1860) edition of Leaves of Grass, ""Live Oak, with Moss"" was never published intact by Whitman, who instead dispersed and shuffled its 12 poems among the 33 other poems of ""Calamus,"" eliminating its narrative of love, loss, and resolution.

Yet these images, if not uniquely western, belonged to the nineteenth-century West as much as did sublime mountainscapes, buckskinned hunters, or battle scenes between Plains Indians and the US army.

These earliest Idaho peoples may have witnessed events unparalleled in recent history.  It is possible, for example, that they witnessed the awesome of the Bonneville Flood and watched the explosive, volcanic eruptions on the eastern plain.  These events probably produced a rich mythology maintained by oral tradition, reinforcing the human relationship to the plain.  Although this oral tradition is not preserved in the archaeological record, much is known of the lifeways of these early peoples.

In particular, the socially constructed use of myth in literature is used to identify how the language of ""difference"" in the literary, media and governmental texts (such as NAFTA) influence environmental policy and action surrounding Latino/a communities. By doing this, the term ""toxic"" can be redirected towards those that instigate environmental racism on minority communities with their use of rhetoric.1 Chicana authors Gaspar de Alba and Viramontes employ story as resistance to the societal structures that define and enclose immigrant and migrant workers in definition of depravity -- both social and ecological.  These definitions are what we have allowed for ""three of every four toxic waste sites in the United States"" to be ""located in low-income communities of color"" and for ""75 percent of Latinas/os in southwestern states"" and to be ""drinking pesticide-tainted water.""2 Desert Blood and Under the Feet of Jesus delve into sociological and ecological matters by connecting the labored female body to the social, physical, and metaphorical environments of the borderland. In particular, Gaspar de Alba's characters hone in on the potent environments and national mythologies that make up the U.S/Mexican border (most specifically El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico), while Viramonte's characters embody the migrant farmworker experience within in the confines of pesticides and poverty and whose locality us undetermined and can thus be placed in any rural U.S. location. By drawing on the construction of myth to contrast the rhetoric of difference, these authors are able to add to the larger ecological discussion and give voice to the concerns of the disenfranchised working Mexican and Mexican American populations.",,,,,,,http://boisestate.worldcat.org/oclc/550553869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,175-195,,,,,The Natural World in Latin American Literatures: Ecocritical Essays on Twentieth Century Writings, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/english_facpubs/120,,[],"[{""id"": 26526, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2010, ""termid"": ""2009/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Ramirez, D.

The measurements revealed a significant difference between shoes in the lower foot segments. The dress shoe exhibited resistance of 0.13 m2KW-1, while the resistance of the winter boot was 0.17 m2KW-1.

Seven of the subjects reported experiencing chronic back pain during the previous six months while eleven subjects reported being symptom free. Eight-hour work induced spine compression observed for the symptomatic employees was found to be significantly higher than the spine compression observed for the asymptomatic employees. The results revealed that spine compression and recovery characteristics can be used to differentiate chronic back pain employees from asymptomatic employees.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that carries with it lifelong physical, emotional, and behavioral consequences. Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the severity of the symptoms. To assist healthcare providers in the management of the autism symptoms, a new smartphone application was developed that allows physicians to observe patient behaviors between office visits, and to manage the patient’s medication based on the information observed. An evaluation was conducted to determine ease of use of the smartphone application by two physicians and three caregivers of patients with autism. The results showed that the new smartphone application will be able to assist the physician in monitoring patients with ASD more accurately than when only using subjective reports provided by caregivers during office visits.

The prototype design includes a flexible fabric “skirt” which is attached to the frame of a standard facemask. The interface adapts easily to the contours of the face and provides increased contact area with the skin. The performance of the prototype facemask was compared to the performance of a standard facemask using a manikin. Air pressure and volume airflow through the masks were controlled. The results showed that the flow and pressure characteristics of the prototype facemask including the skirt interface were comparable to those of the standard facemask technology.

Next, the SEC column is used to separate a polymer mixture into elution slices that each have a unique and definable D value. These slices are collected and individually cross-fractionated according to chemical composition by ThFFF. Values of D are combined with measurements of intrinsic viscosity to yield the molecular weight of the resulting fractions.

Because of the high aspect ratio between breadth and thickness, liquid that is pumped through the channel flows in a laminar fashion, with a velocity profile that varies across the thin (x) dimension. A field is applied external to the channel in order to force analyte into the slower flow streams near one wall. The resulting velocity of the analyte through the channel depends on its interactions with the field, and therefore, on physicochemical properties that govern that interaction. Those physicochemical properties vary with the nature of the applied field, but always include the size of the analyte, because size determines the ability of analyte to reach the faster moving flow streams away from the accumulation wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,871-891,,,,,Ewing's Analytical Instrumentation Handbook, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/chem_facpubs/50,,[],"[{""id"": 26689, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2005, ""termid"": ""2004/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Schimpf, M.

In aqueous carriers, the effects of pH, ionic strength, and surfactant concentration were examined. Compared to ACN, differences in retention time with particle size are greater in aqueous carrier liquids containing sodium azide, and in general retention increases monotonically with azide concentration until a plateau value is reached. A notable exception in this trend is carboxylated polystyrene, whose retention passes through a minimum with increasing sodium azide concentration before increasing to a plateau value. Retention also decreases in sodium azide as the pH is decreased or the concentration of FL-70 surfactant is increased. Yet FL-70 is beneficial because it prevents flocculation of the particles and erratic results at high levels of retention.

First, the development of thermodiffusion          theory is summarized. Next, the apparent independence of  thermodiffusion and degree of polymerization in polymers is discussed.          Thermodiffusion coefficients (D T) measured by thermal field-flow fractionation on  several polymer-solvent mixtures are then summarized. Polymers include a          variety of different molecular weight samples of polystyrene,  poly(á-methyl styrene), polyisoprene, and polymethylmethacrylate,          as well as copolymers of styrene and isoprene. Solvents include  benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, tetrahydrofuran, 2-butanone,          ethyl acetate, and cyclohexane. Measured values of D T do not correlate with predictive models of  thermodiffusion, but are found to correlate with polymer density and  solvent viscosity.          Finally, using a hydrodynamic model of polymer thermodiffusion  in nonpolar solvents, an expression is derived that expresses          D T in terms of physicochemical parameters that can be  estimated or measured independently. These parameters include the  thermal          expansion coefficient, molar volume and viscosity of the  solvent, the radius of a polymer repeat unit, and the Hamaker constants.

Newberry",,,"Engineering Identities, Epistemologies, and Values:  Engineering Education and Practice in Context","Nuclear for Climate, Climate for  Nuclea",,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter emerged from work done as part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant charged with asking how engineering education might be reformed in order to better prepare future engineers to incorporate increasing climate variability—as a result of climate change—into their infrastructure designs. Our focus is on nuclear sci-entists and engineers, and the interventions that might be made to prepare them for nov-el kinds of climate disruptions and how these disruptions could affect plant design and operations. Events at Fukushima in 2011 prompted renewed attention to nuclear safety.  Soon after, scientists recorded record-breaking global temperatures, particularly during the summer of 2012.  Perhaps as a result of these two events, academics and the media have begun asking whether nuclear power plants are robust to natural events beyond the range of historical data, including climate-related events such as increasing drought and rising  cooling-water  temperatures.  Science  policy  scholars,  scientists,  and  engineers outside of nuclear science and engineering have begun to pose similar questions and model possible effects. Our study demonstrates that there is almost no public discourse and very little professional discourse within nuclear science and engineering on this top-ic. We posit that this is largely because of the insular culture and professionalization standards of nuclear science and engineering, which will limit the effectiveness of cur-ricular interventions made in engineering education.

New applications are created daily and library staff may find it difficult to keep up with these innovative technological tools and developments in social media. Idaho has come up with a new way to stay ahead of the game. SPLAT (Special Projects Library Action Team) offers a collaborative model to meet these challenges and enhance library reference services. This model engages a diverse group of library staff chosen from different libraries, skills, and geographic regions. As a team, this group works with a statewide focus to experiment with new trends and share what they learn with the entire library community. The model follows the mantra to make many mistakes quickly when learning new technologies and trends, and to compile best practices so that others do not have to do so. An anonymous, web-based survey was sent to anyone who has interacted or worked with SPLAT members in the past and its focus was on perceptions of the impact SPLAT has had on their library work (see Figure 16.1 for the complete survey). Preliminary results indicate that this model has been successful in its implementation.

Much of the rapid expansion of online video can be attributed to YouTube, which has become the largest and most popular video-sharing platform online. The development of visual and media literacy (VML) competencies is valuable when engaging with social media content and technologies like YouTube. This chapter illustrates how visual and media literacies have been integrated within a set of educational YouTube video projects in an online university course that has been offered regularly since 2008. The projects discussed in this chapter were designed for an audience of adult educators, but have applicability in K-16 classrooms. YouTube was selected as the central video platform for several reasons, which include practical, technological, and societal factors. Competencies described in published definitions of visual and media literacy frame the discussion. Curation projects involve finding, interpreting, and evaluating video resources, which are grouped into collections for educational purposes. Educational video creation projects include video blogs, remix, PowerPoint movies, and interactive video.

Allen and Seaman (2010) identified four categories of course delivery that are based on the proportion of content delivered online: (a) traditional (0% online delivery), (b) web facilitated (1%–29% online delivery), (c) hybrid (30%–79% online delivery), and (d) online (80%–100% online delivery). In this chapter, we focus primarily on the fourth category, in which most or all of the course content is delivered virtually with the aid of online technologies. The growth of online education has been phenomenal. The seventh annual Sloane Survey of Online Learning (Sloan-C, 2009) revealed that approximately 4.6 million students were enrolled in at least one online course in fall 2008, an increase of nearly 17% from the previous year (Allen & Seaman, 2010). As more students enroll in virtual courses, questions and concerns about ethical teaching practice in digital classrooms will continue to emerge. Strike and Soltis (2004) described several types of ethical challenges within the educational context (e.g., punishment and due process, intellectual freedom, equal treatment of students, diversity, professionalism). These types of ethical issues are also present in virtual (online) classrooms, albeit with the added complexities of online course delivery. The online educator shoulders the solemn responsibility of handling student records, instructional materials, and private communications, which are stored and distributed in digital form. Additionally, the educator assumes the added responsibility of maintaining sufficient technical knowledge to avoid unfortunate breaches of confidential information. Although many additional ethical challenges emerge in an online format, we limit our discussion to the specific issues of digital privacy, intellectual property, and professional practice in the online classroom.",,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/13496-005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,55-65,,,,,Teaching Ethically: Challenges and Opportunities, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/psych_facpubs/151,,[],"[{""id"": 26983, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2011/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Elison-Bowers, P.

The course was developed in response to the upsurge in online video production and the prominence of YouTube™ among video-sharing services. A number of challenges surfaced when designing and implementing the course. The necessity of frequent curriculum updates to keep content current with advancements in digital video technologies added to instructor workload. Course policies also had to be written for situations where unexpected changes on the YouTube website interfered with planned assignments. The experience of designing, teaching, redesigning, and re-teaching the course led to the discovery of best practice, which may apply to other courses featuring rapidly changing content or Web 2.0 tools.

The demographic transition began in Western Europe and has spread to the entire world. While Demographic Transition Theory has the power to explain mortality and fertility change, it is yet unable to predict the timing or duration of transition.

27000,112002071,112002071,,2008.0,,,,,Blended Curriculum in the Inclusive K-3 Classroom: Teaching ALL Young Children,Understanding Early Literacy Learning in the Inclusive Classroom,,,,,,,,,,,"Literacy learning is often viewed as a complex, dynamic, and transactive process where literacy refers to the interrelatedness of language- speaking, listening, reading, writing, and viewing. As a process, we know that it begins long before children enter a classroom or school. Like learning to speak and listen, learning about print and those things associated with it begins at home starting from birth when parents read or tell stories, when songs are sung and nursery rhymes chanted, when scribbles on a page are seen and understood to have some meaning.
Literacy teachers and scholars currently have a fairly well-developed understanding of how young children become aware of print (Teale & Sulzby, 1989) and begin their entry into the literacy club (Smith, 2005). Studies of children as young as 2 demonstrate they are able to identify signs, labels, and logos that are familiar to them (Goodman, 1986; Hiebert, 1981). Correspondingly, home-based case studies conducted with children under the age of 3 found that children are extensively aware of the practical functions for writing: creating a list to aid memory, writing signs to control behaviors (e.g., stop signs), and writing to communicate (Heath, 1983; Taylor & Strickland, 1986).
These early understandings of literacy are often referred to by the term emergent literacy (Teale, 1986). Emergent literacy suggests that the development of literacy is taking place within the child. It is a gradual process and will take place over time. Emergent literacy focuses on two aspects: (1) how and when children begin to construct knowledge about reading and writing and (2) how parents and early childhood educators could most effectively support young children's ongoing literacy development (Morrow, 2001).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,186-232,,,,,Blended Curriculum in the Inclusive K-3 Classroom: Teaching ALL Young Children, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/cifs_facpubs/72,,[],"[{""id"": 27000, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2008, ""termid"": ""2007/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Gregory, A.

College students may decide to focus on mastering some class materials and to largely ignore others; on the job, doctors may decide how much time to devote to learning about the new advances in their field; and for a hobby like bird watching, an enthusiast can choose how to allocate their time to learning birds' names and their songs.  Thus, people's success at learning will be driven in part by how they allocate their study time, which brings us to the main question of this chapter: What drives people's allocation of study time as they are attempting to learn new materials?  This question has received much attention since Rose Zack's seminal research in 1961, so to put our current answer in context, we first briefly describe some of the earliest empirical and theoretical work on study-time allocation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,182-198,,,,,Constructions of Remembering and Metacognition: Essays in Honour of Bruce Whittlesea, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/cifs_facpubs/85,,[],"[{""id"": 27205, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Dunlosky, J.', 'Ariel, R.', 'Thiede, K.

For example, consider a student preparing for an upcoming test.  As the student studies, she monitors her progress toward the goal of mastering the material.  If her monitoring indicates that she has not yet monitored suggests that the material has been mastered, she will likely re-study the material until her monitoring suggests that the material has been mastered, at which time she will stop studying.  Accurate metacognitive monitoring is critical to effective regulation of study (Thiede, 1999; Winne & Perry, 2000).  If someone does not accurately differentiate well-learned material from less-learned material, they could waste time studying material that is already well learned of fail to re-study material that has not yet been adequately learned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,85-106,,,,,Handbook of Metacognition in Education, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/cifs_facpubs/87,,[],"[{""id"": 27206, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2009, ""termid"": ""2008/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Thiede, K.

Both are compositionally asymmetrical—that is, the defining member of the construction is from a restricted set.  Converbs and verb-verb compounding are both, in theory, symmetrical in composition—that is, there is no restriction on which verbs may enter into them.  However, we find, upon closer inspection, that predicates of a particular type are most likely to be interpretable as part of a monoclausal versus biclausal converb construction, and that there are also some clear frequency restrictions on which verbs most often appear as part of verb-verb compounds. It is proposed that these restrictions shed further light on the possible historical relationships holding among all four multi-verb construction types.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,35,,,,,Brill, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://www.brill.com/multi-verb-constructions,,[],"[{""id"": 27210, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Thornes, T.']"

Another, the applicative construction, also functions as a morphological causative in the context of a subset of stative intransitive verbs.

This model engages a diverse group of library staff chosen from different libraries, skills, and geographic regions. As a team, this group works with a statewide focus to experiment with new trends and share what they learn with the entire library community. The model follows the mantra to make many mistakes quickly when learning new technologies and trends, and to compile best practices so that others do not have to do so. An anonymous, web-based survey was sent to anyone who has interacted or worked with SPLAT members in the past and its focus was on perceptions of the impact SPLAT has had on their library work (see Figure 16.1 for the complete survey). Preliminary results indicate that this model has been successful in its implementation.

(The only alternative is purposeful design by a divine creator, and that is not science). An understanding of the basic behavioral differences between the sexes within species requires the additional guidance of the theories of sexual selection and parental investment, although it is not always apparent which sexually dimorphic behaviors are attributable to which process, nor is it possible to always clearly differential between the processes themselves (Mayr, 1972). Through the operation of these evolutionary processes, all sexually reproducing organisms, including humans, possess a suite of traits that determine how they will apportion mating effort and parental investment in order to assure maximum viability of their genetic material. The incredibly complex nature of human sexual behavior requires yet another layer of theory to render it coherent because any evolved genetic propensities to behave in one way or another are necessarily mediated by neurohormonal, developmental, and contextual variables. Life history theory is a strong candidate for providing this additional theoretical layer. Life history theory (which began over 30 years ago in quantitative genetics [Bonner, 1965]), while fully consistent with evolutionary theory, stresses and takes seriously the position that genes regulating evolved strategies are expressed facultatively (see Chisholm [1996] for an excellent overview of evolutionary life history theory).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,17-32,,,,,The Role of Theory in Sex Research, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/crimjust_facpubs/103,,[],"[{""id"": 27513, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2000, ""termid"": ""1999/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Walsh, A.']"

This paper contained a number of research strategies and suggestions for testing hypotheses derived from the theory and described predictions about epidemiology, age, social class, risk correlates, offense types, desistence from crime, abstainers from crime, and the longitudinal stability of antisocial behavior.  The theory posits that the antisocial behavior of LCP offenders has its origin in neurodevelopmental processes, that it begins in early chilhood, and continues worsening thereafter.  In contrast, the antisocial behavior of AL offenders has its origins in social processes, begins in adolescence, and ceases for the vast majority in young adulthood.  LCP offenders are few, persistent, and pathological; AL offenders are common, relatively transient, and are relatively ""normal"" (Moffitt, 1993; Moffitt, 1994; Moffitt, 1997).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,125-144,,,,,Biosocial Criminology: Challenging Environmentalism's Supremacy, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/crimjust_facpubs/109,,[],"[{""id"": 27519, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2003, ""termid"": ""2002/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Moffitt, T.

Sociology is indeed adrift in a foggy maze of theoretical contradictions, ideological self-righteousness, and nonsensical postmodern ""display prose"", but to declare it beyond hope is premature.  The discipline needs a solid anchor to stabilize it while its crew figures out how to steer it out of the swamp.  That anchor is biology, the science that sociology divorced itself from by its fundamental interpretation of Durkheim's dictum that the cause of social facts should be sought by other social facts (Udry, 1995).  Sociology as a whole took this tom mean that there are no other sources of human social behavior, and as a result many sociologists became not simply oblivious to biology but ""militantly and proudly ignorant"" (Van den Berghe, 1990, p. 177).  As a subdiscipline of sociology, criminology is essentially in the same boat, although it seems that more criminologists than scholars in other areas of sociology have heeded biology's call, as evidenced by an avalanche of recent books entirely devoted to or containing significant coverage of biosocial approaches (Agnew, 2005; Ellis & Walsh, 2000; Fishbein, 2001; Robinson, 2004; Rowe, 2002; Walsh, 2002; Walsh & Ellis, 2003, 2007).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,20-37,,,,,Evolutionary Forensic Psychology: Darwinian Foundations of Crime and Law, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/crimjust_facpubs/119,,[],"[{""id"": 27520, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2008, ""termid"": ""2007/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Walsh, A.', 'Beaver, K.

The same authors found age of onset of sexual behavior to be negatively related to criminal behavior (the earlier the age of onset, the greater the involvement in criminal activity) in all 31 studies reviewed.  Sexual behavior is examined in the context of the effective sex ratio (the ratio of the number of available men of marriageable age to the number of available women of marriageable age).

	In The Woman Warrior, Kingston draws on many resources to develop a story about her protagonist’s individual development.  As the daughter of Chinese immigrants, she finds herself investigating selfhood in more than individual terms.  Her story is suffused with uncertainty, fantasy, and ambiguity, all of which she navigates through dramatic metaphors of voice and writing.  The book as a whole challenges its readers to consider the ways that language frames and generates meaning, showing that selfhood is shaped by culture.  In this chapter, I will draw upon three categories—prohibition, inscription, and incision—to examine Kingston’s responses to her mother and her legacy as the child of Chinese immigrants.  In particular, I will focus on the fact that, in a book rich with ambiguities, Kingston makes it clear that selfhood is not achieved in isolation.  Although individuation is important for self-development, selves mature in relation to family, history, language, and the contemporary world.  Kingston figures these relationships in several ways, but the mother’s role in embodying or mediating most of them is a consistent theme throughout the book.  By focusing on Kingston’s references to prohibited speech, writing, and scarification (in the form of tattooing or surgical cutting), I will demonstrate some of the ways in which The Woman Warrior portrays selfhood in dynamic and contingent terms, as a process.  Kingston prominently features the role of writing in the articulation of this process, implying that selfhood is an ongoing negotiation instead of a finished condition.
	The first chapter of The Woman Warrior, “No Name Woman,” begins and ends with a dramatic prohibition.  However, the very existence of the chapter, as Kingston’s narrator makes clear, is an ironic violation of that prohibition.  By beginning her book in this way, Kingston shows that her protagonist Maxine must engage with the past in order to grow up.  She must violate the prohibition against telling the story of No Name Woman in order to articulate her sense of herself and the world that has produced her, and readers must conspire with her in the violation in order to proceed with the text.  To accompany Maxine on her adventure of self-knowledge—the adventure of becoming a woman with a name and an identity—readers must trudge with her through a taboo.
	What does this violation lead to or make possible?  In “White Tigers,” one answer seems to be that the narrator is now more free to invent and test new models of identity, a process which depends on the imaginative use of language.  In this chapter, Kingston foregrounds the role of writing in the development of her protagonist Maxine, partly through metaphors of Chinese script, as when she likens a bird to “the ideograph for ‘human’” (20), and partly through depicting writing in the form of scarification, as when the litany of revenges is carved into the skin of her protagonist’s back (34-35).  In the fantasy interlude in which she imagines herself as Fa Mu Lan, Kingston’s narrator begins to exercise her powers of language to produce more satisfying models of selfhood, models that might withstand the negative pressures of her environment.  
	In the event, this first experiment articulates some important lessons about self-development (such as making mental “room for paradoxes” [29]), but it produces a model which proves only partially adequate or temporarily convincing to Kingston’s protagonist.  If the tattooing of the crimes upon Fa Mu Lan’s back provides one example of incision as a phase in the development and growth of the Maxine’s soul, however, it is not the only bodily mutilation that she experiences.  The ritual scarification results in an elegant though grisly script that inaugurates her hero’s quest, but Kingston refers to another form of incision in the last chapter of her book.
	In that chapter, “A Song for a Barbarian Reed Flute,”  Kingston’s narrator alleges that her mother cut her frenum, a membrane connected to the tongue.  Readers have noted that Kingston both posits this event as factual and undercuts it as unverifiable, since the putative event happened in infancy and the narrator has no recollection of it.  The storytelling associated with the event comes to function as a fable because the mother’s stated purpose of cutting the frenum was to liberate the daughter’s speech.  Brave Orchid’s argument is that the narrator’s frenum was unduly restrictive, rooting her daughter’s tongue in a position that marred its capacity for speech, especially for speech in more than one language.  Hence the action was intended to support her daughter by giving her access to multiple worlds or cultures, an access she needs in order to function as a native-born American daughter of Chinese immigrants.  Regardless of the narrator’s conflicted feelings about that maternal support, her decision to end her memoirs with the story about the Barbarian flute song gives the last word not to herself alone but to both her mother and herself, in the form of a collaboration.  This choice is Kingston’s final reminder that selfhood is social.

This turned out to be another instructive exercise in futility.

Translation and Transatlantic Crossings in Kevin Young’s Ardency
In Ardency (2011),  Kevin Young offers a series of interlinked poems depicting the Amistad case, in which enslaved Africans managed to secure their freedom and return to Africa after a prolonged legal battle.  In his book, Young resurrects the dead by depicting their words on the pages of his poem, but he reminds his readers that this very process is a translation of experience into representation.  Moreover, by focusing on the sailor James Covey’s role as a translator for the Amistad Africans, Young figures him as an alter ego of the poet.  
In identifying himself with Covey, Young stresses the transatlantic passage of the slave-trade together with the central role of language in the Amistad case.  Early in his book, Young subtly suggests the connection between his poetry and the act of translation when Covey asks himself, “Could this be my fate, / my invisible art, to translate an opaque race?” (21).  Young plays on the etymological sense of translation and metaphor (“carrying across”)  in a wish Covey conveys to his adoptive white father at the close of a letter: “May my words / reach you in manners I never can, crossing boundless blue between” (22).  Through this ritual-like valediction, Young figuratively links written communication to the transatlantic crossings of the Middle Passage and the eventual return to Africa of the Amistad rebels.
Young turns Covey’s work as translator into a more general allegory of the poet, who translates or bears the words of the past into the present, making them live in a new context.  Young’s poetic impersonations of Covey as well as the Amistad rebels “carry over” and transform not only the archival records documenting their struggle, but also the Amistad poems of Elizabeth Alexander (2005) and Robert Hayden (1945/1962).

We also examine two kinds of responses to the disparity: those that focus on individual interest and those that focus on situational interest. We provide evidence that boys have a wide range of diverse interests and consequently argue that attempts to reform curricula rooted in providing texts that boys like may miss the mark by assuming that educators can know in advance what books will attract male students. Consequently, we contend that approaches focusing on developing instructional contexts that are characterized by ample instruction, appropriate challenges, clear goals, and feedback, demonstrated utility in the here and now, and social connections are more promising.

Steel,,,Science and Politics: An A to Z Guide to Issues and Controversies ,Environmental Justice,,,,,,,,,,,"Environmental justice refers to the fact that racial and ethnic minority communities bear a disproportionate share of the impact of environmental pollution in the U.S. because those communities are located in or near industrial polluters and toxic waste sites.   It is a field of study within the social and environmental sciences as well as a social movement by the same name.  
In the 1980s, researchers began documenting the fact that racial and ethnic minorities in the United States were more likely to live in or near pollution.   By 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency had established an Office of Environmental Justice and federal policy began to focus on ensuring that environmental regulations were applied justly across all segments of U.S. society.  
Researchers have explained the fact that people of color are more likely to live near environmental pollution by seeking to unravel the effects of historic racial zoning laws, limited economic choices in housing for low income residents, the relative powerlessness of racial minorities in the political process, and overt racism.  
Translating the science of environmental justice to policy is made complex by two factors.  The minority-location studies typically express correlations, or connections, among variables, but do not suggest concrete solutions.  Scientists have also examined the impacts of the pollution on those who live nearby by tracing incidences of disease in those populations and comparing those rates to the general population. This type of science establishes relationship between living in an area and a greater than expected rate of disease, but does not prove that any one incidence of cancer is related to a particular toxic waste site.   These factors contribute to the debate over the reliability of science in making remediation for exposure to pollutants or in guiding future decisions.

Oregon voters have considered two different measures, one in 1992 (Measure 13) and one in 1994 (Measure 9). With the exception of Colorado's 1992 vote on Amendment Two, all of the statewide anti-gay initiatives have failed at the ballot box. Colorado's Amendment Two was later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court (see Chapter 11). Table A. 11 displays the election results for the four statewide votes considered in this chapter. This analysis uses county-level data to evaluate the votes on four of these anti-gay initiatives (the 1992 Oregon initiative is not used).
The literature on public opinion and attitudes towards gays suggests that certain voter characteristics correlate with tolerance toward gays. An important empirical question is whether or not voters take those predispositions with them into the voting booth when considering anti-gay initiatives. By comparing socioeconomic, political, and religious characteristics of county populations with the county's vote on the anti-gay measure, we can begin to assess the relationship between tolerance and this divisive social issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,127-132,,,,,Anti-Gay Rights: Assessing Voter Initiatives, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/pubadmin_facpubs/18,,[],"[{""id"": 27707, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 1997, ""termid"": ""1996/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Witt, S.

Our abilities to intentionally control  our motivation to learn, however, remain largely limited because  motivation is a subliminal and synthetic mental state derived from the  interactivity between our prior experiences and the learning  environment. In a digital game-based learning system (DGBLS), learners  are always bombarded by a colossal amount of cognitive, social, and  affective stimuli that afford and affect the interactivity, which can  easily trigger learners' motivational responses and leads to the  consequences of not being able to manage their motivation. As a result  the intended learning processes can be interrupted. Although learners  cannot control their motivation in this case, they can manage their  interactivity with the DGBLS to select and process stimuli that are  relevant to the learning tasks. Therefore this chapter intends to  propose a process framework to empower learners to autonomously manage  their interactivity with the DGBLS in order to stay focused on the  learning tasks. Specifically this framework will draw literatures on  learners' motivational processing and cognitive processing pertaining to  learning in the DGBLS.",,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-61350-441-3.ch010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,210-230,,,,,Interactivity in E-Learning: Case Studies and Frameworks, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/edtech_facpubs/34,,[],"[{""id"": 27837, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2012/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Huang, W.

Given this record of factious instability, Hamilton fears that republican government and, more importantly, the principle of civil liberty will be sacrificed to the more reliable principle of political order. Yet Hamilton urges his readers not to lose faith in republican forms. ""The science of politics,"" in his view, ""like most other sciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various principles is now well understood, which were either not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients."" This new science of politics includes the separation of powers, institutional checks and controls, and the principle of representation -- all of which tend to mollify factious tendencies of popular government. Also among the discoveries of this new science is what is now known as federalism, the ""enlargement of the orbit"" of republican systems through the ""consolidation of several smaller States into on great Confederacy"" (Hamilton, Madison, Jay 1999, 39-41).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,121-135,,,,,The Ashgate Research Companion to Federalism, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/polsci_facpubs/52,,[],"[{""id"": 27864, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2009, ""termid"": ""2008/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Jordan, W.

Explaining how markets operate, Hayek argues that economic efficiency on a global scale arises as the consequence of many discrete, individual, dispersed actions. Individuals possess pieces of knowledge necessary to pursue interests, and the price system of the free market acts as an uncontrolled and uncontrollable mechanism sending signals to people as they pursue their interests. The positive results of this free market system are twofold and mutually reinforcing: producers and consumers cooperate in exchanging goods and the economy as a whole achieves high levels of productivity in goods produced. Following Smith's famous thesis about the ""invisible hand,"" Hayek holds that no single mind is capacious or competent enough to move the pieces of the free market chessboard as efficiently as the free market itself. This led Hayek to believe in the spontaneous ascension of the spontaneous order itself. The Great Society arose as the product of cultural evolution whereby ""institutions and morals, language and law have evolved by a process of cumulative growth and that it is only with and within this framework that human reason has grown and can successfully operate.""1 This evolution also is Darwinian because homegrown traditions survive when they, unlike competing traditions, successfully meet needs.2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,107-126,,,,,"Liberalism, Conservatism, and Hayek's Idea of Spontaneous Order", ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/polsci_facpubs/53,,[],"[{""id"": 27867, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2007, ""termid"": ""2006/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Yenor, S.

The Complex Relation between Identity and Statistics,Epilogue: From Indigenous Demographics to an Indigenous Demography,,,,,,,,,,,"There has always been a close association between enumeration, the classification of peoples and state power. Demographers working with indigenous populations find themselves at the intersection of these forces. Demographic arguments have often been marshalled when settler states have an interest in taxation, in 'protecting' rural minorities or enfranchising populations to vote in ethnically stratified parliaments. At the start of the twenty-first century there are now populations on all inhabited continents making claims to indigenous status, and with each of those claims some sociological and demographic representations of their entitlements in each place. The workshop and the dialogue which leads to this volume have aimed at the broader goal of sketching out what might be called an indigenous demography. Although the context of the indigenous situation in each place is important, the contributions here show that there are also commonalities which make it a good time to introduce a new field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,295-308,,,,,Indigenous Populations and Demography.

Human identities can be hierarchically embedded on multiple layers and associated with language and national citizenship, and anthropologists have documented how various identities can be employed depending on social context.  When governments become involved in enumerating people with complex identities, census categories are not necessarily congruent with native views.1 In other words, ways of recording identity and related demographic and economic descriptions are subject to the biases of those people conducting the enumeration. These anomalies are both appealing to scholars of demography and particularly important for indigenous populations. In any case, demographic sources, if sufficiently detailed, have the potential to illuminate indigenous kinship or other identity connections, add to family oral histories, and document traditional land-tenure patterns. Demographic details can also provide indices of population health through time and inform debates about dynamic relationships between states and indigenous populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,219-237,,,,,Indigenous Peoples and Demography: The Complex Relation between Identity and Statistics, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/anthro_facpubs/80,,[],"[{""id"": 27922, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Ziker, J.

The community is located at the tundra-taiga transition in the Central Taimyr Lowlands. Ust-Avam is ethnically mixed with Dolgan, Nganasan, and a small minority of non-native newcomers. I have conducted ethnographic work there since 1992.
The Dolgan population includes Sakha, Evenk, and Russian ""tundra peasant"" ancestries. Dolgan families traditionally practiced reindeer pastoralism, in combination with game hunting, fishing, trapping, and mercantile trading. The Nganasan traditionlly hunted wild reindeer herds. They rejected Russian Orthodox missionaries, unlike the Dolgan. After 250 years as subjects of czarist Russian, the Dolgan and Nganasan were incorporated intot he planned economy under the Soviets beginning in the early 1930s. As permanent settlements were built most adults came to work at state-managed rural enterprises, schools, the post office, and village administration. As a result of development, by the 1970s residents of Ust-Avam had lost their domestic reindeer (and their ability to travel independent of technology and fuel supplies).
The collapse of the USSR in the 1991 significantly affected Taimyr economy. In Ust-Avam, most working-aged adults were laid off their jobs in 1993. From 1993 to 1997, I documented drastic decreases in fertility rates and increases in mortality due to alcohol (Ziker 2002).

In this chapter we present our interim results of a project reconstructing the cultural landscape of what is today a remote resource extraction outpost of Irkutsk oblast'. Our project used traditional ethnographic field research, ethnohistorical interpretation, and environmental archaeology to understand the intersecting environments of Evenki, Iakut, Russian Settler and Russian Industrial inhabitants. Here we focus upon the meaning of certain transitory spaces often described as 'encampments' [stoibishche] in official Soviet archival records but today are often called 'meadows' [poliana] or 'seasonal or overwintering cabins' [zimov'e] by local people. The Polar Census enumerator A. T. Samokhin wrote of the transitory spaces in his manuscripts with great energy and yet with great difficulty since they complicated the official distinction between 'nomadic' and 'sedentary' populations. Here we argue that a sufficient understanding of the interaction of people and place forces a broader understanding of the 'built environment' which includes meadows, trails and culturally modified trees as material signs of a flexible and autonomous hunting and herding culture. We propose that the material artefacts of what Samokhin described a 'chaotic' and 'semi-nomadic' [polukochevoe] existence can be better described as an adaptation focused upon the use of a 'river valley' [reka] as a territorial unit. Instead of concurring with older arguments that these 'not-yet' settled adaptations were signs of the half=completed pressures of cultural evolution and the incipient extinction of ancient nomadic forms, we argue that this semi-settled use of place if finely attuned to exploit the hunting and trade opportunities that mining and the fur-trade created. Our ethnographic work demonstrates that these adaptations are still viable today in the post-Soviet period. This chapter underscores the importance of the Polar Census archive for providing a frame for the project around which other types of data - such as landscape - can be arranged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,199-225,,,,,The 1926/27 Soviet Polar Census Expeditions, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/anthro_facpubs/48,,[],"[{""id"": 27925, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2011, ""termid"": ""2010/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Anderson, D.

Stüve–Wiedemann syndrome (STWS; OMIM #610559) is a rare bent-bone dysplasia that includes radiologic bone anomalies, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties and hyperthermic episodes. STWS usually results in infant mortality, yet some STWS patients survive at least into early adolescence. STWS is caused by a mutation in the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) gene, which is inherited in an autosomally recessive pattern. Most LIFR mutations resulting in STWS are null mutations which cause instability of the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid), preventing the formation of LIFR and impairing the signalling pathway. LIFR signalling usually follows the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and is initiated by several interleukin-6-type cytokines. STWS is managed on a symptomatic basis, because there is no treatment currently available.

Key Concepts
STWS comprises multiple symptoms affecting multiple physiological systems.
Mutations in LIFR cause mRNA instability, preventing the formation of LIFR protein.
LIFR is important for many IL-6 cytokine family members; and in the case of LIFR mutations, activities of several cytokines are impaired.
The JAK/STAT3 pathway plays a critical role in STWS.

While dumpster diving the local Pacific Telephone office, Jerry found the procedures for making internal equipment orders and charging them to company accounts. Posing on the phone, or pretexting, as company employees he was able to get the correct account numbers and eventually stole and resold about $250,000 in computer equipment (Whiteside, 1979). Twenty-five years later, in 2005, Hewlett-Packard’s board discovered that sensitive information from a board meeting had been leaked to the media. The chairman of the board decided to determine the culprit and hired a security consulting firm for the job. Private investigators from the firm called the phone company and, posing as the victims, or pretexting, obtained the phone records of members of the media without their knowledge (Kersetter, 2006; Shankland, 2006). Recently, many people with email accounts have been recipients of yet another social engineering attack, phishing, the use of deceptive emails to encourage users to input sensitive identifying data. These three cases are specific examples of a more general information security phenomenon: social engineering.

Social engineering is the use of deception and other non-technical means to gain unauthorized access to information or information systems. Social engineering has been used to describe a number of attacks ranging from widespread phishing for identity information to targeted pretexting for corporate or governmental espionage. Social engineers rely on psychological triggers (e.g., fear, kindness, and greed) and cognitive biases (e.g., truth bias, anchoring, and miscalculation of risk) to gain unauthorized access and evade detection. For the most part, current countermeasures against social engineering attacks rely on people for prevention by educating users through awareness programs and by policy implementation, enforcement and auditing, although new technical countermeasures are emerging.

This chapter has the following objectives:

• Define social engineering
• Provide a taxonomy of social engineering attacks
• Discuss emotional triggers and cognitive biases on which social engineers rely
• Describe current social engineering countermeasures and how they map to techniques
• Discuss future trends in social engineering research and countermeasures

Karwowski ,,,Advances in Physical Ergonomics and Human Factors: Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Cooling Dynamics of Wet Clothing,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract. Protective clothing is frequently used to provide safety and comfort for persons exposed to various temperature environments. Water absorbed by clothing can significantly influence the heat transfer characteristics of the clothing material. Understanding the dynamics of evaporative fabric cooling is important in the development of new garments. To investigate the cooling dynamics associated with wet clothing, a series of experiments was conducted to document the cooling created by single and multi-layered fabric samples exposed to controlled temperature, humidity and airflow conditions. The results revealed that the onset and the magnitude of evaporative cooling are determined by the amount of water absorbed in a fabric. The number of fabric layers used in turn, determines the amount of water retained within a material. This information can now provide the basis for determining the number of fabric layers to be used in new garment de-sign and development.",,,,,,,DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-41694- _3231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,311-318,,,,,Springer International Publishing ,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 29253, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2016, ""termid"": ""2015/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Reischl, U.', 'Goonetilleke, R.

The alluring benefits of YouTube as an educational resource include the vast amount of free video content, which may be curated into collections directly on YouTube. Free video hosting, basic video editing, and online captioning tools are available for video creators. However, there are challenges when using YouTube as an educational resource. It may be necessary to review multiple videos to find good educational content. Sideline content, such as comments, might be inappropriate. The entire site might be blocked at school or library locations. Copyright issues surface when downloading videos to carry into schools or when uploading videos containing copyrighted materials.

New applications are created daily and library staff may find it difficult to keep up with these innovative technological tools and developments in social media. Idaho has come up with a new way to stay ahead of the game. SPLAT (Special Projects Library Action Team) offers a collaborative model to meet these challenges and enhance library reference services. This model engages a diverse group of library staff chosen from different libraries, skills, and geographic regions. As a team, this group works with a statewide focus to experiment with new trends and share what they learn with the entire library community. The model follows the mantra to make many mistakes quickly when learning new technologies and trends, and to compile best practices so that others do not have to do so. An anonymous, web-based survey was sent to anyone who has interacted or worked with SPLAT members in the past and its focus was on perceptions of the impact SPLAT has had on their library work (see Figure 16.1 for the complete survey). Preliminary results indicate that this model has been successful in its implementation. This chapter presents a collaborative model that can be used in any region to help many libraries come up to speed simultaneously.",,,,,,,http://boisestate.worldcat.org/oclc/759584867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,241-256,,,,,Leading the Reference Renaissance: Today's Ideas for Tomorrow's Cutting-Edge Services, ,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/lib_facpubs/53,,[],"[{""id"": 32559, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2012, ""termid"": ""2011/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Silva, J.

entirely on metal cation transport and redox reactions in simple two-terminal
metal–electrolyte–metal/metal–insulator–metal (MEM/MIM) device structures
005B [1]. The device uses an oxidizable (soluble) active electrode, typically
(but not limited to) Ag or Cu. The counter electrode is an inert (not soluble in
the solid electrolyte) electrode, for example, W, TiN, and Pt. An oxide, chalcogenide, or halide material between the electrodes serves to transport the metal cations [2]. A positive voltage applied to the oxidizable electrode leads to the dissolution of the metal and deposition of a metallic (Ag- or Cu-containing)
filament at the opposite electrode. This metallic filament ultimately bridges the
relatively insulating ion conductor and defines the low-resistance on state (or
states). The filament is dissolved by applying a voltage of the opposite polarity,
which returns the cell to a high-resistance off state, defined by the area of the cell and the resistivity of the ion conductor.",,First,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,483-514,,,,,"Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the wide-ranging application of this conclusion in scholarship reveals its continued indebtedness to a theological understanding of martyrdom. Martyrdom necessarily includes the death of the martyr and the overwhelming majority of Christians have not been martyrs. Thus, in a very real sense, martyrdom is not part of Christian identity. The seeming malleability of martyrdom reveals the substitution of the martyr’s death with a theological construct that might be called 'willingness to suffer.’ This substitution is enabled by the use of 'identity,’ a term that is characterized by imprecise boundaries between categories of analysis and of practice. Enabled by this imprecision, scholarship on martyrdom has sought to recreate the Christian group identity of martyrdom on an individual level. This has lead to theses about the widespread development of Christian martyrdom based on limited evidence that perpetuates misunderstandings about intentional self-death. I propose that when studying Christian martyrdom, we intentionally isolate the theological justifications that support ‘willingness to suffer,' which are broadly inculcated in Christian self-understanding, from the act of martyrdom itself. This will allow the exploration of the comparatively rare phenomenon of martyrdom from non-theological perspectives as well closer analysis of how martyrdom's existential impact has been leveraged in Christian institution-building.

Jeff Westover
In a number of texts, both published and unpublished, Elizabeth Bishop addresses the themes of marriage, love, and courtship. In an era when it was dangerous to be an out-of-the-closet lesbian, the issues of love and marriage were vexed ones for her. As a young woman, she rejected Robert Seaver’s marriage proposal (Millier 112). Later, her friend Pauline Hemingway wondered in a letter to Bishop whether she and Tom Wanning were engaged (Millier 102), and Robert Lowell famously confessed to her that she was “the one that got away” (WIA 225-26). As a woman whose most important romantic relationships were lesbian at a time when same-sex relationships (much less marriages) were not socially sanctioned, Bishop had to confront the issue of marriage and adopt a quasi-public stance toward it in order to pursue a career as a professional writer. Her letters demonstrate that she felt the social pressure of other people’s expectations that she should marry. In a letter of March 11, 1941, for instance, Bishop wryly points out to Frani Blough that her housekeeper, Mrs. Almyda, wants her to have a baby (OA 99). I propose to address Bishop’s treatment of this topic in several contexts, including two unpublished and virtually undiscussed stories from the archives, “Eula Wiggle” (VC 53.19) and “River-Rat” (VC 53.4), in order to account for a pattern of indirection she displays regarding the institution (or “enterprise,” to borrow terms used by Bishop’s mentor, Marianne Moore, in her own important long poem about marriage). In particular, these two stories reveal that marriage was not only on Bishop’s mind as “material” for fiction and poetry, but as a matter to reckon with in personal terms.
In keeping with her reputation for reticence, when Bishop addresses the matter of courtship and marriage in her writing, she often does so indirectly. In several texts, for instance, courting characters or married spouses are observed and commented on by a narrator, so that Bishop can treat the topic through a distanced perspective. This is the case in the poem “House Guest,” as well as the two unpublished stories. In the first two “Songs for a Colored Singer,” moreover, Bishop invents a persona who expresses her dissatisfaction with marriage, which has gotten so bad that she is “going to go and take the bus / and find someone monogamous” (Poems 37). In “Roosters,” Bishop tartly comments on the subordination and even disposability of wives. In addition, a youthful Bishop published the story of a courtship that goes singularly awry, “The
Thumb.” The character-narrator of this story is a male suitor who is both attracted to and repelled by the woman he pursues. In a posthumously published story, “Was It in His Hand?,” two female friends (the narrator being one of them) consult a psychic who assumes that they want to know what their future husbands will be like. Although the subject of marriage is not at the center of other major poems, Bishop wrote many love poems, including not only exuberant ones, but also ones about unhappy, lost, or unrequited love (“Insomnia,” “Four Poems,” “Argument,” “Letter to N.Y.,” “Varick Street,” “Song for the Rainy Season,” “One Art,” “It is marvelous to wake up together,” “Dear, my compass,” “Close, close all night,” “Vague Poem,” and “Breakfast Song”). In the important long poem “Crusoe in England,” moreover, the speaker’s solitude is a central feature, and his grief about the death of Friday powerfully resonates at the end of it. Incomplete families also appear in the Manuelzinho poems (“Manuelzinho,” “Squatter’s Children,” “Gypsophilia”). As she indicates in an unpublished letter to Ruth Foster, she also watched at least one woman whom she cared for, Judy Flynne, lose her intellectual liveliness after many years of marriage (VC 188.33). Finally, in “Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle,” dated 1978, she wittily figures marriage as a tender monstrosity: “One flesh and two heads / engaged in kisses or in pecks, / Oh white seething marriage! / O Swan with Two Necks!” (Poems 264). The unpublished stories can enrich and deepen our sense of Bishop’s attitude toward marriage in relation to her own long-term “marriages” with women, her ambitions as a professional writer, and her fraught relationship to home and travel.

36151,113069150,113069150,,2018.0,,,,,News on the Right: Studying Conservative News Cultures,The Establishment roots of the liberal media critique,,,,,,,,,,,"The notion that a loose association of individuals, groups, and institutions dominated American postwar political culture went unquestioned within conservative circles by the early 1960s.  This Establishment, as National Review labeled it, and the journalists and news outlets deemed integral to its functioning typically are considered centrist by the standards of the time.  Yet the idea that the mainstream media betray a liberal bias, which developed on the right during the 1950s and gained widespread acceptance the following decade, initially was grounded in arguments about the Establishment. 
This chapter will examine how National Review and publisher William Buckley, Jr. – despite representing a sort of Establishment conservatism themselves – embedded the idea of liberal media bias in their argument about the existence and character of the American Establishment during the late 1950s and early 1960s, intertwining the two concepts and laying the foundation for widespread acceptance of both. Buckley had pitched the journal from its start in 1955 as a necessary counter to what he judged a liberal postwar political structure that was biased against conservatism.  Editorials, columns, and other content regularly reinforced the charge that a “Liberal Machine” ran the nation and forced conformity with its way of thinking with aid from the mainstream media that functioned as its “propaganda machine.”  Editors and contributors eventually began to charge individual journalists and news institutions with belonging to or serving as mouthpieces of an American Establishment, which editor Frank Meyer described as “men inspired by so essential a unity of belief on fundamental matters that consultation, organization, detailed agreement, is unnecessary,”  and by the Goldwater campaign of 1964 such claims were commonplace.
 These efforts were part of National Review’s attempt to sow distrust of a post-industrialist power structure that favored the liberal values of “knowledge elites,” including the mainstream media.  There was an element of self-interest at play, as the journal sought to attract investors and readers by offering itself as an alternative to traditional news sources. More significantly, however, the journal worked to forge a cohesive movement capable of challenging the prevailing political culture – a culture it argued was directed by the American Establishment – by fashioning “a symbolic collective identity” for Americans displeased with this culture and by casting liberals as a common enemy against which they could unite.  These efforts thus helped link popular discontent with conservative intellectualism.
The right’s efforts to cast doubt on the credibility of the mainstream media is not a new phenomenon but one that dates back several decades, and this chapter will address how National Review simultaneously branded the Establishment and the media as liberal, linking the two ideas and helping to strengthen the ideological divide taking shape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 36151, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 36151, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2017, ""termid"": ""2017/01"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]","['Lane, J.']"

This chapter traces the critical development of weird westerns back to the nineteenth century. Although the writer Bret Harte is often credited with *originating* many conventions of the popular western (against which weird westerns later reacted), this essay provides historical and generic contexts to place him more accurately as a hybrid *adaptor* of earlier genres who challenged the conventions of gender, race, and manifest destiny already associated with the western genre by the 1860s.

38463,111116629,111116629,,2019.0,,,,,Women on the Edge in Early Modern Europe.  (Collection of Essays edited by Aidan Norrie and Lisa Hopkins),"""Anna Stanislawska's Orphan Girl of 1685: Autobiography of a Coerced Marriage""",,,,,,,,,,,"Anna Stanisławska wrote an autobiography describing forced marriage to a mentally ill man who terrorized her, but she managed escape.  The case was so extraordinary that Jan Andzrej Morsztyn wrote, “A Maid, for she knows no husband, and yet a wife,/For he lives, he to whom she was married.”
Stanisławska might have accepted her fate, but instead she used the system of law, patronage, and family connections to escape.  She describes the strategies to extricate herself, and concludes with the most damning pieces of evidence against the transacting in women.  
She wins a divorce, though not without loss.  Her account reveals a woman of character from a distant time but whose desire for liberty and self-determination is eternal.

	Franciszka Urszula Radziwiłłowa (1705-1753) wrote for her own theater, casted actors from her own family court, introduced tragedies, comedies, one act plays and ballets and could be called “the mother of Polish theater.” My focus will be upon the fact that she found her own voice by challenging traditional expectations and that she advocated for personal freedom in her plays, poetry, and prose.  Rather than be limited by the conventional forms of expression and behavior that would have been expected of women in her place and time, she found a different form of private and public expression.  Being a playwright was not her only contribution.  Franciszka Urszula Radziwiłłowa founded the longest running courtly center of theater at Nieśwież and built the building housing the archive there.  She was a woman who had found her own voice and used it.  She wrote, “I am a woman, I am quite aware of my own capabilities,”  and she used these capabilities to reject the patriarchal culture in which she was living, and to express her own ideas regarding love, marriage, and freedom.  
	Franciszka Urszula Radziwiłłowa married into one of the richest and most powerful families of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth when she married Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł nick-named “Rybeńko” or “Little Fishie” on account of his gentle nature.  But she brought a great deal to the marriage as a lady of letters and the only surviving child and heiress to the fortune of the Castellan of Kraków, Janusz Wiśniowiecki, who died in 1741.     Because her husband became the Voivode of Wilno and the Hetman of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, his engagement in public affairs kept him away from home and so Francziszka Urszula Radziwiłłowa’s life was filled with the duties of a wife and mother, but also the obligations of a large landowner with a great fortune who often stood in for her husband in his absence.    Despite these obligations, she was able to devote herself to her work as a playwright, producing more than 12 plays.  While she was noteworthy in her translation of the works of Molière, thanks to her achievements, the theater at Nieśwież developed its own repertoire of works in the Polish language.
Her most extensive biographer, Barbara Judkowiak, has devoted a lifetime to Radziwiłłowa’s work from the point of view of the history of Polish literature and Polish theater, but this study examines Radziwiłłowa’s prose, poetry, and letters from a feminist perspective and focuses upon the ways that she was to overcome some of the limitations placed upon her.   Based upon an analysis of her writing, some of the most clear cut ways that Radziwiłłowa challenged convention was by insisting upon love and freedom of choice in marriage at a time when parents still customarily arranged the marriages of their children.  The second way that she resisted the mores of her time was by expressing her doubts and objections to the patriarchal order of the time through her plays, poetry and didactic literature.  And finally, as a writer and femme savant, she raised the cultural level of the court.  She collected works, constructed the building for and re-organized the archives at Nieśwież, establishing the foundation of the greatest archive of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.  Even though she is most well-known for her achievements as a playwright and poet, her work as a collector, translator, and archivist may have been more significant for the preservation of Polish history and culture.  And in the end, without this archive, her most distinctive voice would never have been heard.

40389,112139145,112139145,,2020.0,,,,,MLA Approaches to Teaching Homer's Odyssey,Using Visual Art to Teach The Odyssey,,,,,,,,,,,"Using art is a good way to help students learn about The Odyssey.  By comparing key episodes from the poem with visual representations of them, students learn about important themes and parallels and grow to appreciate the artistry of the poem’s narrative patterns. For instance, Odysseus’s characteristic cunning can be understood by comparing the Cyclops episode with pictures of the event. The scene appears on ancient Greek vases and other works, many of which are available via ArtStor.org.  
The Cyclops episode can also be compared to Penelope’s unraveling of her shroud for Laertes. This action shows how Penelope is like Odysseus in her use of cunning to address a problem. Similarly, to emphasize the parallel between the families of Odysseus and Agamemnon, the contrast between Penelope and Clytemnestra can be explored through visual aids. There are also many ancient depictions of Orestes killing his mother to avenge Agamemnon’s murder.
Beyond considerations of theme and characterization, art can be used to call students’ attention to narrative design in The Odyssey.  By comparing examples of the geometric patterns on ancient Greek vases with the narrative of Odysseus’s adventures on his way back to Ithaca, students can better recognize the sophistication of Homer’s storytelling. This lesson is based on an argument by Cedric Whitman, so instructors may want to provide a brief synopsis of his argument. I simply give students a handout with a list of the episodes in the order of their narration, using the list as a tool to demonstrate Homer’s artistry (see attachment). 
However, before providing the list, I ask students to arrange a random collection of slides in their correct order. This assignment can be completed in class on mobile devices via Nearpod. Teachers may set up free accounts for this application and generate a code allowing students to arrange the slides online. The application allows instructors to see how students attempt to accomplish this task as they perform it. Students must actively engage what they know about the poem as they try to put the slides in order.  
After this activity, I give students the list and ask them to discuss their efforts. The list visualizes Homer’s narrative organization, including the fact that shorter episodes are grouped together and surround longer, more significant episodes. It helps to indicate the centrality of the journey to the underworld in Odysseus’s quest to get back home. These points can be raised during discussion in relation to the students’ experience of arranging the slides. To build on this lesson, the narrative design of the adventures can be compared to the parallel quest of Telamachus in the first four books of the poem with that of Odysseus in subsequent books. 
Finally, Romare Bearden’s artwork provides a way for students to explore the poem’s cultural legacy of The Odyssey. His series of collage, prints, and paintings recasts the poem in an African American context.

It is important to understand the past in order to adequately build upon the literature in an effective and coherent fashion. Increased technologies in K-20 schools are likely to influence the appearance and format of assessments. Current assessment models will evolve and so will their associated validity arguments. This chapter also outlines gaps in needed student measures, and viable directions for validation work with measures of students’ content knowledge.  We hope that readers might take up ideas presented in this chapter as a way for conversations with colleagues in the same field and across fields, as a way to have broader impact. Through such conversations, scholars may better synergize research efforts, better define intellectual merit of their work across fields, and better influence quality of research that includes studying students’ content outcomes using quantitative measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,205-229,,,,,Routledge,"New York, NY",,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 41686, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2018/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 41686, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2018, ""termid"": ""2018/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]","['Bostic, J.', 'Krupa, E.', 'Carney, M.', 'Shih, J.']"

We, as teacher educators, turned to reflection through self-study to investigate our professional practice with the aim of better understanding and overcoming those challenges. Like Bullock (2017), we utilized teacher candidates’ perspectives to disrupt, confirm, and extend our narratives. We focused on the practice of giving teacher candidates feedback on their developing teaching during their clinical placement in elementary schools. Feedback is central to our work as liaisons (i.e., university-based supervisors) with teacher candidates in the field and critical to their learning and improvement (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Through this self-study, we sought to answer the following research question: What underlying tensions constrain our feedback, as liaisons, to our teacher candidates in clinical placements? How can we better negotiate those tensions to make this work sustainable for full-time faculty?",978-0-473-44471-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,385-391,,,,,Self-Study of Teacher Education Practices,"East Sussex, England",,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://www.castleconference.com,,"[{""attachmentid"": 14061, ""mimetype"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"", ""filename"": ""Final Castle_2018_CH.

In this context, phenomenology is important both as a theoretical tradition and a research method, in both cases directing attention to the experiential, relational and intersubjective dimensions of pedagogy, teaching and learning. In Germany, phenomenology as a method and as a philosophy has aimed at redefining traditional theories of Bildung and education in ways both empirical and theoretical. In Anglo-America, phenomenology has been used primarily as a methodological approach to illuminate lived experience particularly in the caring professions; it has also occasionally provided possibilities for articulating theories of teaching and learning in close relation with concrete practice.

This chapter or entry begins with an overview of Mollenhauer’s eventful life, and then discusses in greater depth the main phases of his thought: 1) an early phase of engagement with critical theory and praxis; and 2), a highly productive cultural and socio-historical phase, in which Mollenhauer developed the “anthropological ingredients for responsible education” using an innovative method or “science” of cultural examples.

This rhetorical analysis deploys a material-discursive understanding of rhetoric, a theory of language in which meaning is shaped by an affective relationship between physical, or material, reality and discourse, which can include historical and cultural articulations of place, often rooted in deeply entrenched power dynamics. This methodology is deployed to contextualize the growing synchronicity and cooperation between the overt alt right white nationalism as seen in the 2017 ‘Unite the Right’ rally in Charlottesville and the far right patriot movements as seen in the 2014 standoff at Cliven Bundy’s ranch and the 2016 armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. In an effort to better understand the communicative practices of far right groups in the United States that aim to form alliances across shared ideologies, connecting identity to land, this chapter explores the convergence of far right white nationalism and the frontier narratives that animate the mythic west—where the social imaginary coheres to the physical landscape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Routledge,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,"[{""attachmentid"": 14623, ""mimetype"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"", ""filename"": ""Ch19-Boggs-FIN (1).docx"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeW1KUlhWN2tRSzlqZFpPaDJuN2d6ZWNLRFpIdHA1YUdhV095SWJ3VEFBUU1mQkJQeXV1TS9qdzBYcHZndzYwWGJPRXRsRkk0SmpzQT0%3D"", ""filesize"": 62265}]","[{""id"": 42939, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Boggs, K.

Understanding characteristics of language and voice associated with deception and dominance helps negotiators identify the use of these strategies and achieve higher self-interests in various use cases, including business negotiations and law enforcement. We aim to expand traditional research on these characteristics from dyadic interactions to group communication. This study follows the same group experiment, a modified Mafia game, as described in the other chapters. Linguistic and vocalic features were extracted from the recorded audio files, and several models were built to examine the predictors of perceived dominance and deceptive cues. Our results show that some features are significantly correlated with dominance as suggested by the existing research, such as lower fundamental frequency, greater variability in loudness, higher voice quality, longer turn-at-talk duration, larger dominance ratio and a greater number of words. However, some features turn out not to be significantly correlated with dominance, such as mean level of loudness, polarity of emotions, hedging ratio and disfluency ratio, though the existing research predicts these relationships. Among our explored features, only turn-at-talk duration is significantly correlated with deceptive status. Our research shows preliminary evidence for the similarities and differences of signals of dominance and deception in dyads and groups and has implications for negotiators in real life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Springer,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,6,,,[],"[{""id"": 46492, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2020/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 46492, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2019/03"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}]","['Pentland, S.

The smaller catechism, widely popularized in Germany and beyond, was enormously influential as a practical household code, and as Luther intimates, as a “small confessional book, prayer book [and] textbook (Lehrbüchlein).” In the last of these senses, this book prefigured many elements familiar in education today, offering both a core curriculum—standardized down to the letter—and a catechetical method for its instructional implementation. This paper traces the origin of this text and its impact on later educational methods and materials, using German and American examples from the 16th to the 21st centuries. I begin by briefly describing the history and nature of the catechism prior to Luther, as well as the context from which Luther’s smaller catechism emerged and the nature of this text itself. This then provides the basis for my discussion of its impact, including its enormous influence within the reformation itself, and for consideration of the theoretical and historical interpretations seeking to explain it.

Challenges and Opportunities of Exploring Connections Across Thematically Diverse Areas,,,,,,,,,,,"As the nascent RRN began to take shape its leadership, including then-director of CRS Susan McGrath, observed a consequential and somewhat
surprising gap. While many of the other major thematic areas regarding
refugee research—international legal regimes, policy analysis, educational
opportunities, and integration initiatives among them—were key thematic
areas for the network, environmental issues represented an important new
area of both conceptual and practical concern, and largely fell beyond the
realm of refugee research proper. As a result, she sought to draw together
scholars in this emergent field to help create a new research cluster with an
emphasis on networking, interdisciplinarity, and knowledge generation.
In this chapter, we explore the successes and challenges of the Environmental Displacement Cluster with a particular focus on four areas—1) the
origins and structure of the networking model; 2) making the case for
“environmentally induced displacement” as a substantive conceptual field
and our main organizing concept; 3) how our cluster enabled other interventions into knowledge production concerning our main organizing
concept; and 4) reflections on what has worked in this model and what
remain as challenges moving forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,20,,,,,University of Calgary Press,Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,https://press.ucalgary.ca/books/9781773850856/,,[],"[{""id"": 46967, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Bose, P.', 'Lunstrum, E.

We will not give the details of this here:  we will give a simpler implementation of the same general idea, a predicative theory of classes and sets in which the criterion for a class to be a set is stated in terms of symmetry, and the sets of any model of which will similarly satisfy NF.   This is not a contribution toward the consistency question for NF:  we do not address the question of  how to build a model of either of these class theories.

This work was motivated by a theorem of Forster and others (\cite{forsterbook}, pp. ???) to the effect  that the stratified formulas of the language of set theory admit a semantic characterization as precisely the formulas which are invariant under setlike permutations in all models.  This suggested  to us that it ought to be possible to develop a semantic motivation for stratified comprehension (the comprehension of NF which is often dismissed as a ``syntactical trick"").",,not known,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,not known,,,,,College Publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,not known,,,[],"[{""id"": 47890, ""status"": ""Submitted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2019, ""termid"": ""2019/02"", ""listingorder"": 2, ""completionorder"": 2}]","['Holmes, M.

51275,112139145,112139145,,2021.0,,,,,Critical Insights: Ralph Waldo Emerson,Mary Oliver's Debt to Emerson,,,,,,,,,,,"Mary Oliver’s Debt to Emerson In 2000 Mary Oliver published an introduction to a volume of Emerson’s work. His impact on her writing and imagination is significant, though her poetic voice is distinctly her own. One aspect of Oliver’s debt to Emerson is evident in the Whitmanic strain in her writing. Oliver writes that Whitman’s “words,” are “a spiritual and a physical touching” (Upstream 104). Such dualism courses throughout the writing of Oliver, Whitman, and Emerson. Even though all these writers cherish the physical world for itself, they also view it as an embodiment of the spiritual. In a rare interview, Oliver expresses this Emersonian idea to Renee Olander: “The world of nature is the great warehouse of our figurative language.” In Nature, Emerson famously writes of his dramatic union with the natural world, portraying himself as a “transparent eyeball” to emphasize his transcendent connection to the universe. Oliver is less grandiose, but she takes the spiritual just as seriously as he does. In her essay “Perfect Days,” for instance, she attests to a spiritual union with the natural world, but unlike Emerson she valorizes the ordinary (Long Life 32-34). She even prefers it to the extraordinary as the token of the authentic. Nevertheless, she shares Emerson’s commitment to the epiphanies of nature. Indeed, attentiveness to the natural world is a key link between Oliver and Emerson. For Oliver, Ezra Pound’s claim rings true: “the natural object is always the adequate symbol.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Salem / Grey House,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,https://www.salempress.com/Media/SalemPress/samples/CI%20Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson%20final%20ToC.pdf,,"[{""attachmentid"": 25216, ""mimetype"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"", ""filename"": ""Emerson Salem Press Volume May 29 deadline.docx"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeUhJRXRBWEhMK1huSjBScW41K1p5NzNyZmtrbnFVcWlENmh4SjhSbGRnQ2xKbmVwQnRldW5vYTNicU1KMlJUb25PWDJHaURxT0QwOVMxYlpTeFBlclhYdDh3OGt5TnVKVWZMRk4rWGplVzJvPQ%3D%3D"", ""filesize"": 17995}, {""attachmentid"": 25217, ""mimetype"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"", ""filename"": ""Westover Abstract 052920.docx"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeUhJRXRBWEhMK1huSjBScW41K1p5NzhrbDA2S2pTRlZad2Q5cEIwNmJ5TndBSEk4U01tMVNWVkVIb29tUllJbTZpSTVZZ2Rkc0NlYz0%3D"", ""filesize"": 15325}, {""attachmentid"": 25218, ""mimetype"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"", ""filename"": ""Westover CV 4 pp 2020.docx"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeUhJRXRBWEhMK1huSjBScW41K1p5N3drL0FmcVg4aDR0d2Q5cEIwNmJ5Tnd2YWVMT1lGNXplenJyTTE0SkVXQS9FMDNLaWhLaGtDMD0%3D"", ""filesize"": 37189}, {""attachmentid"": 25219, ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""filename"": ""Submission Email May 2020.pdf"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeUhJRXRBWEhMK1huSjBScW41K1p5NzN1NXI1QXBjMmwwcGpvTGFuYStnaE5XaW5IMkVkbW9TOUg4VFNtL2lnaHVPbVlLcHZDQ0JOND0%3D"", ""filesize"": 133013}, {""attachmentid"": 25220, ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""filename"": ""Disaster Email June 2020.pdf"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeUhJRXRBWEhMK1huSjBScW41K1p5Ny9XUDNxQU01K1JzVkhjZEw1aHBiY24rQmlTamNKYytEYXdQMEh2dGxReG1LaUcvZ01LL1U3UT0%3D"", ""filesize"": 257731}]","[{""id"": 51275, ""status"": ""Work Discontinued"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/01"", ""listingorder"": 7, ""completionorder"": 1}]","['Westover, J.

We use a dialogic approach to wrestle with this question drawing from our experience of working with movements against extractivism in Pakistan and Colombia. Resource geographies are constituted by embodied spatial practices, and social movements are rich sites of knowledge creation that can follow alternative epistemologies. Instead of considering social movements as objects of investigation, we focus on our own positionality, the performance of academic learning, and the embodied and performative aspects of these struggles that may contradict and even potentiate our modalities of learning about these conflicts. To do so, we explore action research and radical performance geography as approaches for doing critical resource geographies. This dialogue centers around a set of questions on the ethics, modalities, tools, and outputs of action research that lies at the intersection of political action and investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Routledge,New York,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 51763, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/02"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}]","['Courtheyn, C.', 'Kamal, A.']"

52759,114025971,114025971,,2020.0,,,,,Good Reasons to Run,Paying it Forward: Candidate Contributions and Support for Diverse Candidates,,,,,,,,,,,"We rarely think about candidates making contributions to other candidates, but could candidate transfers be a useful tool for helping more diverse candidates run and succeed? Candidate contributions refer to the ability of candidates to redistribute their own resources to help other candidates’ campaigns. By transferring their funds this way, candidates can signal the quality of other candidates. Additionally, they can provide financial support for diverse candidates who may have less access to traditional campaign fundraising paths. Finally, candidate contributions may help connect candidates, fostering close relationships and a feeling of belonging. As an added bonus, by donating to other candidates and party committees, candidates contribute to their party’s success and facilitate connections in the party. These connections help candidates gain influence in their party (Kettler 2014).

These factors may motivate candidates to contribute to fellow candidates, perhaps especially those that lack access to established fundraising networks. Do candidates, particularly women candidates, use the redistribution of contributions to help women candidates succeed? If diverse candidates are the beneficiaries of candidate contributions, this mechanism has great potential to at least remove a reason for not running. Moreover, it may offer an additional path for supporting women candidates’ campaigns. Thus, the goal of this research is to contribute to a better understanding of candidate-to-candidate contributions and its usefulness as a tool for helping a more diverse set of candidates run for office.

This in turn gives the present a sense of urgency. It, in turn, is portrayed as a time when action, investment and change—often unprecedented in scope and scale—are all urgently needed. And just as the past is described in terms of its failings, brokenness and incompletion, the future is characterized by its totality, completion and finality. This pattern is considered first in historically through the example of Comenius and the printing press; next, it is examined in present-day guise: in discourses related to “personalized learning” and the algorithmic technologies enabling them.",978-952-369-013-4,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.33134/HUP-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,141-159,,,,,Helsinki University Press,Helsinki,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,https://hup.fi/site/books/e/10.33134/HUP-4/,,"[{""attachmentid"": 27707, ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""filename"": ""The Technological Imaginary - Myth and Enlightenment in Personalized Learning.pdf"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeTg0YVBBQWpyRitZY05wZHo5MDNBdGlRcTVyUU10cEdtNmVaSDY3ZUp4MHBMbnVKZS90T2VzRXBhdlZGY1FyeXRPTnQrVldtOGRTSUlhUXpGWG1wRGJuYzdyK3lnR1JyVFNHRzRqUzhoVERsNngxMXhOZDB6TFlwZU9MeXF5dHgxR3JKSURGWk5DdGdqWXh6OHRlamlydz09"", ""filesize"": 1463297}]","[{""id"": 52953, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2020, ""termid"": ""2020/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Friesen, N.']"

Phenomenological and pedagogical perspectives,"Atmospheres and Understanding: Past, Present and Future",,,,,,,,,,,"Heidegger asserts that Stimmungen, sustained moods or attunements, are the fundamental mode or medium of our being and being‐together. In this sense Stimmungen can be said to fundamentally atmospheric. It is a shared mood or atmosphere that determines the way that the world is disclosed to us—meaning that atmospheres possess a deeply epistemic, hermeneutic dimension. If every atmosphere brings with it a shared interpretation of the world, then one needs to share or participate in this atmosphere in order to share in knowledge or learning. Only when a Stimmung suitable to such disclosure has been cultivated or encountered will the sought‐after knowledge “dawn” on one, as Bollnow puts it (2017, p. 1414; 1956, p. 57). It goes without saying that Bollnow’s statement has significant implications for pedagogy, for teaching and learning as fundamentally atmospheric experiences, and these are explored in this paper. But I begin by discussing the elusive epistemology of the atmospheric itself—what we are able to know about how we know, what access we have to the atmospheric, to the mode of our being and knowing.

Maci",,,Routledge Handbook of Scientific Communication,Expanding Expertise in Communicating Science through Public and Citizen,,,,,,,,,,,"Scientific expertise is often seen as the purview of the makers of Western scientific knowledge: the professionals in labs and in the field who hold academic credentials. However, scientific practitioners can and should recognize and incorporate expertise and knowledge from those outside this realm, such as Indigenous traditions and experiential knowledge, which is what citizen science or public science works toward. This chapter examines the nature of citizen science and public science and what it means for the creation and communication of scientific knowledge. Public science acknowledges that the Public Appreciation of Science and Technology (PAST) model, which emphasizes one-way communication between scientific experts and the general public, does not allow for dynamic engagement of the public in scientific enterprises. However, the Critical Understanding of Science in Public (CUSP) model provides a framework for civic engagement and a more democratic society through scientific knowledge production. If science communication not only aims to transmit knowledge but contribute to a just, democratic society and a critical, educated public, it must acknowledge the essential roles of citizen scientists and public science. Thus, this chapter takes up the possibilities for science to account for a broader understanding of public engagement, scientific expertise, and what it means to communicate science.

Ghost Writing in Amy Tan’s The Bonesetter’s Daughter

In the epilogue to The Bonesetter’s Daughter, Amy Tan offers a scene that combines the adult writer, Ruth Young, at her desk developing a story with the writer’s childhood memory of writing messages from a ghost on a tea-tray lined with sand. By fusing the two in one scene, Tan provides an apt metaphor for the work she performs throughout her fiction, that of investigating and reclaiming aspects of the past in order to define the self, align it with female ancestors, and orient it toward the future. The image of the daughter at the tea-tray writing out messages from the dead symbolizes the “possession” of the daughter by her ghostly female ancestor. This possession is not a passive state but an active one, for the daughter exercises her agency as a writer by using her imagination and responding through her written words to the to her mother about Precious Auntie.
Moreover, the story of Precious Auntie in The Bonesetter’s Daughter may be interpreted as a creative adaptation of “No Name Woman,” the first chapter of Maxine Hong Kingston’s The Woman Warrior. Tan borrows the topos of the patriarchal silencing of women from Kingston as well as the imagery of paper and ink to recover the silenced female ancestor.
In The Bonesetter’s Daughter, the fact that the family manufactures ink is a critical feature of LiLing’s childhood experience and her relationship with Precious Auntie.  Given that ink is the means by which Precious Auntie tries to kill herself (the first time) and instead injures and disfigures herself, it is also a primary element in the plot of Precious Auntie’s life story. LiLing’s calligraphy and Ruth’s own work as a writer are part of the family of images relating to writing in the novel. 
These images provide a strong parallel to the writing metaphors in “No Name Woman” and “White Tigers,” the first two chapters of Kingston’s Woman Warrior.  In “No Name Woman,” Kingston figures her memoir about her anonymous aunt as a tribute or homage, taking the place of origami offerings to the dead. In “White Tigers,” Kingston portrays the long section in which Maxine “becomes” Fa Mu Lan as an imaginative entering into an ink drawing, a passage that focuses on the similarity between the image of a bird in flight with that of the Chinese ideograph for “human.” This image symbolizes Kingston’s active engagement with the tale of Fa Mu Lan in her work as a writer.  In turn, Tan’s adaptation and revision of Kingston’s anonymous aunt in The Bonesetter’s Daughter similarly foregrounds images of writing. Tan does so in order to transfigure the anonymous aunt, a deliberately forgotten female ancestor, into a mother with a name and life story.

grappling with challenges and learning experiences that never could have been predicted. 
During times of global uncertainty, the demand for innovative learning and teaching across 
the globe must be stepped up and at the forefront of educational endeavors. The challenges 
and formidable impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic have stretched educational systems 
throughout the world to reassess their goals as students and educators are asked to teach and 
learn from home while distancing themselves from others. The opportunity to address the 
myriad challenges that we are faced with and provide a quality education for all students 
incorporating technology and innovative strategies for online learning in order to meet the 
multifaceted needs of our students requires us to revolutionize the learning experience and 
carefully address the numerous dimensions yielded by these profound changes. This chapter 
provides an overview of inputs from the field in the United States and a discussion of 
alternatives found globally. It focuses on the strategies and resources to reinvigorate 
education acknowledging that online learning is tantamount to helping our students learn. 
Interviews with educators, students and parents are presented to offer insight from various 
persprectives. Examples of research-based strategies are provided to strengthen lesson design, 
pedagogical input, and expand the knowledge of creative resources.

English-language educational research provides little evidence to suggest that translation is important or beneficial. If the object of such research is empirical and quantitative as it so often is then it is not even necessarily dependent on any single set of linguistic representations or language. It instead speaks through numbers, graphs and charts. In this context, translation appears as an exception, as a way of making contributions of uncommon figures like Paulo Freire or Jean Piaget accessible from Portuguese or French. This chapter argues, however, that the potential value of translation in education is not a matter of access or even of cross-cultural communication. Instead, it is arguably nothing less than a question of finding a language for education that is itself explicitly educational rather than one that is primarily psychological, sociological, philosophical or historical in nature.",9783847422990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,337-351,,,,,Barbara Budrich,"Opladen, Toronto",,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,http://cup.columbia.edu/book/international-perspectives-on-school-settings-education-policy-and-digital-strategies/9783847422990,,[],"[{""id"": 57995, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2021, ""termid"": ""2021/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Friesen, N.']"

Thompson's Philosophy of Agriculture,Western Livestock Production and Their Challenge to Thompson’s Food System Archetypes,,,,,,,,,,,"Food systems are complex and made especially so by the competing values that diverse communities attribute to them and expect from them. The four archetypes of food systems that Paul B. Thompson has conceptualized help to provide clarity to this complexity; however, the food system of livestock production in the American West does not neatly align with any of these. In this chapter, I briefly describe the archetypes and how they each align and misalign with my experiences in this food system. My readers can expect to learn a bit about the history of grazing in the West, federally managed lands, current livestock practices in the West, and how the intertwining of the three create a food system that challenges the four archetypes. Ultimately, I aim to illustrate that Western livestock production systems do not fit neatly into Thompson’s archetypes, leading to either refining the archetypes or the emergence of a fifth archetype that shares features with (but is not reducible to) the others.",10.1007/978-3-031-37484-5,,,,,,978-3-031-37483-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,87-102,,,,,Springer,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,"[{""attachmentid"": 49306, ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""filename"": ""cf749924-9fb3-4507-8c96-f84c08ed7693.pdf"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeXo2REJlMGYvK25wd1ZKLy9TSmY1Z1BldFFJTUVIM0ZXRG42K1RDTERGVDNIeVpJR0pYSTNxTFFlQ25HRDUydzg5c0t3Z2orTUVEaWYwN25sVmJja2FYeXhUZmw0M2x0cQ%3D%3D"", ""filesize"": 139738}]","[{""id"": 64072, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 64072, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2022, ""termid"": ""2022/02"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}]","['Talley, J.

Salmon was founded after gold was struck in the nearby mountains, and has seen its fair share of mining boom-and-bust cycles. The recent activity surrounding cobalt mining is routine for this community, yet the social landscape for mining has changed. Mines now face a wide range of environmental and social considerations that add time and cost to operations, while demand increases for critical minerals to advance our technological society. It is a dilemma that takes on an unaccustomed cast when the minerals are those that support a more environmentally sustainable future. 
 These transitions present a series of juxtapositions. Cobalt mining can be environmentally destructive, yet this has to be weighed against the overall good it can do for the environment. Incoming residents looking to be closer to nature place new pressures on infrastructure and the community bonds of rural towns, but then add to the economic and cultural diversity that can help a rural community adapt to a changing world. Such juxtaposition is a reality we must face as we navigate the environmental and social changes that occur as we move toward a more environmentally sustainable future. The story of Salmon is a story of challenges and optimism that mining and social transitions can be done responsibly through the social, environmental, and economic boom-and-busts of the American West.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,University of Utah Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,"[{""attachmentid"": 49311, ""mimetype"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"", ""filename"": ""Booming and Busting.docx"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeXo2REJlMGYvK25wd1ZKLy9TSmY1Z0hobWJLYTMrbzlKUGJIbUpBU1Q5ZXZ0NUVpWHloS1dyL1I2R25QWlVqTldXWGx6MkQ4R2xXVT0%3D"", ""filesize"": 46953}]","[{""id"": 68826, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}, {""id"": 68826, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]","['Talley, J.

Field philosophy throws itself into a particular issue or case, rather than merely applying theory or entering with abstract notions of the problem. Field philosophy is practiced  in situ  – the philosophy is not an abstract dimension of the situation, but is the medium within which the situation occurs. It views philosophy as a lived practice as much as an intellectual endeavor. Reporting on field philosophy will always be understated; the context it is practiced in is too rich – too saturated – to fully recognize in spoken language. 
 My case is livestock grazing on a family ranch in Northeastern Nevada. Through the seven years I’ve been working with the ranch, I’ve come to recognize the role of federal land governance in enacting (always imperfectly) varying conceptions of democracy and the ways that structured epistemic projects serve to curate diverging democratic ideals. This is the medium within which my practice occurs. Here, I report on the ways collaboration is enacted, and how adherence to scientific discipline undermines the collaborative landscape. Along the way, readers will learn a bit about public land management and the deep-seated challenges that must be addressed to develop collaborative public land management that puts the  public  back into  public  land.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,"[{""attachmentid"": 49312, ""mimetype"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"", ""filename"": ""Limits to Collaboration.docx"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeXo2REJlMGYvK25wd1ZKLy9TSmY1Z0QwelhzWU4xUzVlK2ZtdDA4bHZLZzBXaTdtckhyaDhvN082S25ERzg1Z1BDYlZRNnYrNTNFRT0%3D"", ""filesize"": 57150}]","[{""id"": 68827, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}, {""id"": 68827, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]","['Talley, J.

The goal of this study was to determine an adjustment factor that will allow measurements obtained for any combination of arm circumference and cuff size to be compared to each other. The results of this study showed that the percentage (%) value of upper arm circumference coverge by the cuff can serve as such an adjustment factor. Data obtained from nineteen test subjects showed that a 1% change in upper arm coverage results in a 1 mmHg change in both systolic and diastolic pressure readings. Using the proposed % adjustment factor allows a patient’s blood pressure to be compared to blood pressure values obtained using any combination of cuff bladder size and arm circumference.

Education, in other words, is adequately addressed neither through normativizing critical analysis, nor through empirical investigation and assessment— arguably the two dominant discourses in educational research today. Education for Schleiermacher, as Schmied- Kowarzik (2008) writes, “is neither a normative nor an empirical discipline, but is instead a practical one which is concerned with the uncovering of dialectical interconnections…” (p. 61; emphases added). Schleiermacher himself puts it thusly: “Our observations here are not speculative but are in the strict sense of the word theoretical.” And the “strict sense” of theory— captured in the ancient Greek theoria3— “relate[s] ” above all “to a specific practice,” as Schleiermacher himself goes on to explain (above, p. 29; emphases added).",,1st,,,,,978-1433193873,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,177-215,,,,,Peter Lang,New York,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,1,,,[],"[{""id"": 69628, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Friesen, N.']"

Phenomenology and pedagogy converge not just in their interest in particular experiences on either side of this divide; both imply a position or an “attitude” from which everyday pedagogical experience can be understood. Phenomenology is a philosophical tradition and an approach to qualitative research that has been adapted to the study of lived experience in fields as diverse as psychology, psychiatry and sociology. In both philosophy and qualitative research, phenomenology is seen as embodying a method with multiple stages or facets, known collectively as the reduction, bracketing or epoché.

Developed from the Greek paιdᾰgugῐᾱ (paidagogía; paidos ¼ child; agogos ¼ leader) and rendered as la pédagogie in French, pedagogía in Spanish and Pädagogik in German, Continental Pedagogy is based on understandings that are radically different from those taken for granted in education in the English-speaking world. Continental Pedagogy sees education as being primarily concerned neither with school and curricula, nor with the pedagogy in the English sense of the techniques and politics of teaching (Friesen, 2019). Instead, it begins with the insight that education and pedagogy are both about the influence that is exercised by one person or group (i.e., the educator) on another (i.e., the educand), and that this influence exists in special relation to the world. The resulting configuration of self, other and world forms what has been called the “pedagogical triangle” (Fig. 1; e.g., see: Briançon, 2019). Within this configuration, pedagogy is particularly concerned with the personal experience of the educand with the educator (i.e., the pedagogical relation; Friesen, 2017) and with the educand’s relationship with the world (Bildung, formación, le formation).",,3rd,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818630-5.03028-1 245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,245–255,,,,,Elsevier,Leyden,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,7,,,[],"[{""id"": 69637, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Friesen, N.', 'Kenklies, K.']"

70819,114133843,114133843,,2025.0,,,,,Teaching UX: A Process Approach,Teaching Accessibility Through UX Design,,,,,,,,,,,"UX design infiltrates the practice of technical and professional (TPC) communication because its principles align with the goal of TPC to prioritize the needs of the user. UX goals ask the designer to not only consider if the product is usable but also to consider the experience of that use through innovative thinking (Tham, 2022). This type of design process requires a hyper collaborative relationship with the user and demands the designer relinquish the role of expert to center the user in the design space. Accessibility, the process of ensuring equal access to technologies and information (Oswal, n.d.), aligns with these UX goals. Both UX and accessibility design require the designer to think outside of their own experiences and beyond traditional design, which is why the process begins with empathy. UX invites the designer to emerge in the perspective of the user with a truly open mind attempting to understand how users live in their daily lives (Kelley with Littman, 2005). Using a graduate student technical communication course as a backdrop, this chapter offers methods and benefits for instructors to place UX principles, accessibility practices, and service learning in concert within the technical communication to teach future practitioners the benefit of dispersed power and hyper collaboration. In the course, students are challenged to develop accessible designs with a variety of community partners with disabilities. Students practice user research methods, including interviewing and observation, to understand the access needs these users face in an area of daily living. Students use this data and flexible interaction with their users to inform how they define the need, design the product, and then evaluate, iterate, and implement their designs. As part of this process, students keep reflection journals to capture their own experiences in the UX design space. Students also conference with the instructor at regular intervals. Although there are challenges such as managing community partners, logistics, and scheduling, overwhelmingly, the greatest challenge students encountered was the inability to let go of their own assumptions regarding access solutions and let the user’s experience guide the design process. Students often “solved” the user’s need from their own perspective rather than the lived experience of access for the user. The restructuring of the expert/novice relationship is not an easy transition for students to accomplish in the classroom environment. The dynamics of the classroom typically demand students illustrate their expertise by knowing the “right” method and skill to use to design the “correct” product. The process of centering the user and asking the student to relinquish the role of expert felt disorienting at times. And yet this dynamic, interactive but sometimes uncomfortable relationship is invaluable to accessible, usable designing. In order to facilitate students’ ability to value and practice their dual role of expert and novice requires high-touch guidance from the instructor, which might take the shape of frequent student interviews. The goals of these interactions include students recognizing missteps and forming pathways to revisit their empathy work, which often meant new research, defining, evaluating and iterating. More importantly, these sessions guide students to trust the UX design process and to view accessibility as an experience of the user rather than a list of guidelines. With intentional guidance, students learn UX is not a clean, formulaic process. It is beautifully messy because it engages with the infinite, dynamic diversity of the human experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 70819, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]","['Huntsman, S.']"

All NUA languages carry a verb suffix signaling the addition of a bene- factive argument to the organic valence. In most cases, they represent the only means for expressing a beneficiary as a core argument. Applicative suffixes in NUA appear in most cases to originate from a ‘give’ verb. Although not always noted as such in the available grammatical descriptions, NUA applicative constructions show causative-ben- efactive syncretism associated with semantic verb type. The benefactive function is quite consistent with transitive and active (agentive) intransitives, whereas with stative (or patientive) intransitive verbs, the suffix functions as a causative. In languages that have distinct applicative forms and morphological causatives, their frequency of use still follows this pattern.",10.1515/9783110730951-015,1,,,,,978-3-11-073548-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,477-509,,,,,DeGruyter Mouton,Berlin,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,1,,,"[{""attachmentid"": 53839, ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""filename"": ""proof1_15_Thornes_9783110735482_Zuniga_0224_EC.pdf"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeTZiSU1lSTc3SUgzc0dkMmZRb2NlOTNCTnZ4NGVNc0I4dnVQdW96SmFYa0U0eHppbGZ6bHY2OFVTbmZLbWFhNCs0bk1abEtCb3g1UzNmU1llalBOVTlhSTdOTlNHMG9JY29JYTJYcFRDSy9JPQ%3D%3D"", ""filesize"": 614887}]","[{""id"": 71366, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Thornes, T.

Between 1786-1830, Wallonian communities marginalized by foreign occupation sought to defend and preserve these traditions. Evolving over centuries into elaborate public ceremonies, the religious origins of these festivals were eclipsed in the eighteenth century by secular tropes and enthusiastic popular participation. Emperor Joseph II attempted to regulate festival culture in 1786, a decision that engendered significant resistance and was a leading catalyst for Belgian revolt against Austrian rule during the Brabantine Revolution. In the French Revolutionary era, during which festivals with Catholic origins were banned and replaced with commemorations of the French Republic, the preservation of these folkloric traditions was a focal point for Belgian popular resistance. After Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, the Dutch annexation of Belgian provinces brought still more foreign regulation, continuing the centralized restrictions on festival life that originated during the Austrian and French eras of occupation.    
 Historical research for this period of festival culture in Belgium has not received significant attention beyond isolated studies centered on specific festivals. This chapter analyzes how the proponents of these festivals weathered widespread regulation and outright bans of what were historically liturgical processionals across the Wallonian province of Hainaut, and how what began as religious rituals espoused by ecclesiastical elites became populist symbols of unity and resistance. Popular voices were not often included in the historical record of early modern Belgium and when they appear in archival documents, it is often as protest to elites – either provincial governments or the regency administrators of various foreign occupiers, including Austrians, French, and Dutch. Ultimately, this study centers on how ordinary people in these communities experienced and defended Wallonian festival culture during a critical fifty-year period when regulation and interdiction threatened to destroy traditional celebrations in Hainaut.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Brepols,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 71793, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}, {""id"": 71793, ""status"": ""Accepted"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2023/02"", ""listingorder"": 4, ""completionorder"": 4}]","['Hadley, E.']"

The path leading away from this grave peril, Heydorn argues, is Bildung. It offers not only an escape from imminent danger, but also from dehumanization: “humanity cannot bear a dehumanized survival,” Heydorn writes in concluding his text: “Society must be formed [gebildet] in such a way that it knows its human purpose and the danger in which it finds itself. The path between [purpose] and peril must be found.” (1974: 273). Today, the conditions of the Anthropocene mean that the survival of the human race is again radically open to question. The threat in this case, however, is neither dehumanization nor nuclear destruction (although these remain im-portant); it is instead environmental degradation and catastrophic climate change. And Bildung—especially in this broad sense of coming to know about oneself and one’s condition—is clearly relevant to it. But this is certainly not a Bildung that, as Heydorn remarks, represents “the pro-gressive liberation of humanity to itself” (p. 273) and that is centered only on human purpose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,63-80,,,,,Barbara Budrich / Columbia University Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,https://cup.columbia.edu/book/survival-through-bildung/9783847424802,,[],"[{""id"": 75713, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Friesen, N.']"

First, the word “learning”—as used in networked learning and in educational discourse generally—tends to conflate the roles and responsibilities of student and teacher. Second, and again as in educational discourse broadly, the definitions provided for networked learning fail to clearly distinguish between “is” and “ought,” between description and prescription. The task of carefully defining networked learning is justified as providing “a concise description of a field of research and practice” but relies on normative criteria that have no unambiguous descriptive corollaries. Third and finally, to speak of experi-ences as “networked” is to direct attention to structured, interconnected, or entangled manifestations of learning. This is incompatible with the ontological presuppositions of phenomenology and with phenomenological accounts of learning as “non-disponible:” inaccessible, non-available, and non-controllable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,191-209,,,,,Springer,Chem,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-62780-4,,[],"[{""id"": 75714, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Friesen, N.']"

By stationing its troops abroad, the United States has effectively outsourced many of the inevitable environmental consequences of its unique military position. Activists have noticed this particular consequence of basing and have mobilized against it in several countries. Our study takes a multimethod approach to assess the effect of these movements. To assess whether protests have been effective in changing the deployments by the United States, we employ a textual review of available Status of Forces Agreements, a case study of the protest movements in Vieques and Okinawa, and a large observational study of the effect of protests on the concentration of U.S. forces in other countries. While there has been some success in local movements, the overall effect of protests has been minimal thus far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 75804, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2025, ""termid"": ""2024/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 75804, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}, {""id"": 75804, ""status"": ""In Progress"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2023/03"", ""listingorder"": 1, ""completionorder"": 1}]","['Allen, M.']"

Strauss,,,Geographies of Displacement/s,Environmental displacement in the Anthropocene,,,,,,,,,,,"This intervention invites more substantial scholarly attention to human displacement in and of the Anthropocene—this current epoch in which humans have become the primary drivers of global environmental change—and sets out an initial framework for its study. The framework is organized around three interrelated contributions. First is the recognition that displacement is driven not just by climate change but also broader forms of environmental change defining the Anthropocene, including biodiversity loss, changes to land and water resources, and the buildup of nuclear debris, along with their intersections. Second, the framework parses out three distinct moments of displacement in the Anthropocene: displacement as a consequence of, prerequisite to, and active response to environmental change. Third, the framework rejects environmental (neo)determinism by showing how displacement across these distinct moments and drivers is more than environmental: It is the articulation of environmental and sociopolitical–economic factors, which are routinely shaped by inequality and play out within a broader series of crises and crisis narratives that drive displacement and hinder viable solutions. We ground these interventions in examples of political conflict, anti-immigrant politics, the posttruth and colonial politics of knowledge production, and the Anthropocene itself as crisis requiring displacement to clean up its mess. Although each example is quite distinct, a common thread stitched across them is colonialism, highlighting a recurring extra-environmental driver of displacement. Taken together, these dynamics underscore that displacement is not an unfortunate by-product of the Anthropocene but woven into its very fabric.",10.4324/9781003381181,1,,,,,9781003381181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,644-653,,,,,Routledge,New York,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,[],"[{""id"": 76065, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Spring"", ""year"": 2023, ""termid"": ""2022/03"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Lunstrum, E.

Severe weather, flooding, fires, amplified humidity, increases in energy and utility costs, in addition to the reputational risks of inaction and the resulting negative impacts on communities, all constitute direct and indirect forms of risk. Consequently, in addition to educating and inspiring visitors toward a regenerative and equitable future, museums are equally tasked with revising operational planning to meet the ethical expectations of stakeholders and realities of altered ecosystems. These efforts include evaluating and updating internal operations to both mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis, as well as measuring and documenting practices, impacts, and progress. As museums are working to find their place within an increasingly complex climate crisis, both in terms of interpretive responsibilities and operational challenges, many have found the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be a helpful NorthStar in navigating environmental and social impact management. Cultural institutions and the SDGs serve each other reciprocally. Museums preserve cultural and natural heritage and share vital stories; while the SDGs create a framework with which museums can use to connect their messages with real world change, and measure impact for accountability and SDG attainment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,Emory University,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,,,,"[{""attachmentid"": 61475, ""mimetype"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"", ""filename"": ""Climate on Culture Article.docx"", ""downloadurl"": ""https://faculty180.interfolio.com/public/download.php?key=SDRwNCtxSUpsamxBQ213WS9ucHFuOXdEckhSTndUMEU1ZEl3S1FYNlk1UTRFRytxRHVPV3RGeEM1UlkwREhVeW1KUlhWN2tRSzlpUWtsRU1FY0ZqZ1FadFdEc1RMTjllN3FwUlhLQ1R2NVlsMHNJZ3Q1YmJXTUhwU2liemZJRjc2WUtxMUpMY01wNThzVTM1ZU41YmFnPT0%3D"", ""filesize"": 38455}]","[{""id"": 76819, ""status"": ""In Press"", ""term"": ""Fall"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/02"", ""listingorder"": 5, ""completionorder"": 5}]","['Capaldo, S.

There are more established methods for remediation such as the use of Direct currents (DC) and alternating current (AC) as well as more recent research on the use of electromagnetic fields (Azad et al., 2013, 2015; Farid et al., 2014). The focus of this section is on the use of DC, referred to as electrokinetic remediation. In such method, DC is applied across electrodes inserted into the soil where applying an electric potential, electric current is induced across the electrodes for mobilization and extraction of contaminants. Contaminants can be transported to extraction wells using electroosmosis and ionic migration along with electrolysis causing a series of chemical reactions. In addition to the induced flow of contaminants, electrodeposition and ion exchange (for heavy metals) can be used for heavy metal remediation. 
A constant electric field of DC can directly move any charged particle and, hence, be used to remediate any material that can be ionized (e.g., inorganics, heavy metals, and ionic radioactive compounds). Such electric field can also indirectly move and remediate noncharged (both polar or nonpolar) material (e.g., organic compounds).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual,,,,,,,,ASCE,"Reston, VA",,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter,,,1,,,[],"[{""id"": 77626, ""status"": ""Completed/Published"", ""term"": ""Summer"", ""year"": 2024, ""termid"": ""2024/01"", ""listingorder"": 6, ""completionorder"": 6}]","['Farid, A.']"
