        "Description/Abstract": "A sense of belonging is an integral aspect of success in a long-term, group-oriented endeavor such as the pursuit of a college education. When students feel their presence at college is fraudulent, their achievements unfounded, or that they will be further disenfranchised if their true self is discovered, it is less likely that they will connect to the people who and services that can help them achieve their educational goals. This \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d or \u201cimposter phenomenon\u201d can be addressed and turned around through a concerted effort. While that effort involves a personal journey, like any journey it is often aided and accompanied by others. Through strategic outreach efforts, academic libraries are positioned to be important players in that journey, helping these \u201cimposters\u201d renegotiate their self-images to include a sense of their essential place in academia and belief in their ability to successfully complete their academic goals.",
