        "Description/Abstract": "Chalcogenide glasses are the advanced materials of choice for the emerging nanoionic memory devices \u2013 conductive bridge random access memory (CBRAM). To understand the nature of the effects occurring in these devices under influence of electron-beam radiation, the interaction of blanked chalcogenide films and nanostructured films containing chalcogenide glass and silver (Ag) source are studied. Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray\r\nspectroscopy and X-ray diffraction are used for establishing the structural and compositional effects occurring under radiation. They have strong ompositional dependence with the stoichiometric compositions being most stable showing less structural changes after radiation. These effects are associated with the availability of lone-pair electrons, their participation in the bonding onfigurations and the coupling of electron states in the bandgap. They are further enhanced in the bilayers by silver diffusion in the chalcogenide matrix, as a result of interaction with electrons. These effects are used to interpret the electrical performance of CBRAM devices after radiation. The devices are characterized by their resistance states, threshold voltage and endurance. Those based on selenium-rich and stoichiometric composition undergo continuous parameters changes with increase in the radiation dose while in the devices based on germanium-rich composition a counter play of the structural changes and expulsion of silver occur.",
