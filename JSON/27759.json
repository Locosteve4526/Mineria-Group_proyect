        "Description/Abstract": "Northern Thailand has 16 hot spring systems with surface temperatures near or greater than 80\u00b0C with potential for binary plant power generation. Presently only Fang system generates power from wells flowing a total of 8.3 1/s of 116\u00b0C water to a 300 kW single module Ormat binary plant. Current production is 150-250 KW, which potentially can be increased by constructing new wells and increasing flow by pumping. Of the other 15 systems, 4 are in national parks and not considered for development. Several of the hot springs systems have silica geothermometry &gt;130\u00b0C suggesting significant undeveloped resources exist in northern Thailand. Certainly the San Kamphaeng hot springs have the greatest known potential (estimated ~5MW) but like most of the systems it is associated with high-angle faulting and drilling has yet to find permeable zones yielding high flows (&gt;11 l/s). The current project of the Thailand Department of Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) will survey these prospects with the intention of installing a small plant of 2-10 MW",
