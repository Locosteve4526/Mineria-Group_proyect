        "Description/Abstract": "Shortly after the passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, the  March 1991 signing of the United States Air Quality Accord, and the  release of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program s  Integrated Assessment in November of 1991, there appeared a firestorm of  criticism directed at the science of acid rain. Some of the severest  criticism came from within the scientific community, as prominent  researchers castigated scientists for lacking objectivity, for failing  to distinguish between science and policy, and for out-right advocacy of  policy positions. The findings of this study, based on interviews of  both United States and Canadian scientists in 1997, suggest that while  many scientists continue to share these concerns, more and more  scientists are viewing advocacy as a moral and civic obligation.",
