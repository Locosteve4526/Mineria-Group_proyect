        "Description/Abstract": "This case allows students to examine leadership styles in Shakespeare\u2019s late tragicomedy The Winter\u2019s Tale, focusing on the character Paulina as an example of a marginalized figure who grows into an effective leader. The Winter\u2019s Tale portrays the jealous king Leontes, who accuses his wife Hermione of committing adultery with his best friend Polixenes. Hermione\u2019s servant Paulina confronts Leontes, but is ineffective in calming him down with her bold criticisms of his behavior. As the play progresses, Paulina becomes a more effective leader, even in her position of relative powerlessness. Although she has no official status or authority, she learns to use patience and persistence to guide the king to become a wiser and more effective ruler, as well as to protect those she cares about.",
