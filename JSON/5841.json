        "Description/Abstract": "In light of the increasing number of girls participating in sports, the pressures associated with &quot;big time sports,&quot; and interest in preventing alcohol-related problems in female athletes, the purpose of this viewpoint is to examine the prevalence of alcohol abuse in female athletes and to provide coaches and teachers with suggestions for education and prevention. Some of these include a continual increase in the competition, negotiating relationships with teammates and coaches, performance anxiety or fear of failure, decreased social interaction due to competition, time management issues, burnout, and coping with injuries (Storch, Storch, Killiany, &amp; Roberti, 2005).",
