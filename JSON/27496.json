        "Description/Abstract": "The authors offer an interdisciplinary approach of research that anchors on a broader spectrum of interests in methodology than most textbooks. Instead of solely focusing on criminal justice research, this book introduces the major social/behavioral science disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, economics, geography, and their relationship with criminal justice and criminology. I think it is a smart and thoughtful approach given the facts that majorities of research methods applied in CJ are borrowed from those closely related disciplines and I have no doubt that they will have continuing influence in CJ research.",
