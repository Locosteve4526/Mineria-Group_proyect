        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;AB5 toxins have long been known as key virulence factors secreted from gram-negative bacteria as part of the infectious process of human or animal hosts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;These toxins, primarily Cholera Toxin (CT) from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; and Heat-Labile Toxin (LT) from Enterotoxigenic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; (ETEC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; are becoming more prevalent as vaccine adjuvants. While they do have some similarities in structure and function, the unique differences between AB5 toxins, and even within their subunits, can lead to a versatile immune response. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;We have compiled a holistic list of publications regarding CT and LT, two of the most thoroughly studied AB5 toxin vaccine adjuvants, highlighting their clinical and pre-clinical relevance from 2019-2024 with key-term searches in PubMed and a local university database. From this literature, we found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;CT and its B-subunit (CTB) have been used in the currently licensed Cholera vaccines, but both the A and B subunits are being tested in a wide variety of vaccines. LT, specifically its double mutated form (dmLT) and B-subunit (LTB), are being utilized as both an antigen and adjuvant against traveler\u2019s diarrhea. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Despite their devastating roles in disease progression and pathogenesis, AB5 toxins continued to be highlighted as critical vaccine adjuvants with relevance to human health.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Overall, this review shows that AB5 toxins are becoming highly effective vaccine adjuvants for a whole host of potential pathogens.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
