        "Description/Abstract": "There is a growing need for remote biological sensing in both laboratory and harsh field environments. Sensing and detection of biological entities such as anthrax, Ebola and other micro-organisms of interest involves sampling of the environment, amplification, analysis and identification of the target DNA. A key component of such a sensor is a low cost, portable, reusable, continuous flow polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycler. Fabrication with low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) can provide a reusable low cost device capable of operating in a wide range of environments The design and manufacture of a prototype continuous flow micro-fluidic PCR device using low temperature co-fired ceramic is presented. Initial modeling of flow characteristics and heat transfer was carried out in SolidWorks\u2122. The prototype device employs resistance heaters below the channels, buried and surface thermocouples for temperature monitoring, and air gaps for thermal isolation.",
