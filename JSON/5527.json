        "Description/Abstract": "Ligand K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been shown to be a powerful tool in the study of the electronic structure of ligand-metal interactions in open shell metal ions. The technique was developed previously for application to ligand-Cu[sup II] covalency but has now been extended for application to metal ions with more than one electron (or hole). By use of the expressions derived and the protocol outlined in this study, ligand pre-edge intensity provides a direct probe of the ligand valence p-orbital covalency of a metal-ligand bond. The technique is extended to other d[sup n] systems by application of the analysis presented in this paper.",
