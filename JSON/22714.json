        "Description/Abstract": "&quot;Climate change is another wild card that could have a significant impact on how both developed and developing urban centres play out in the future. Around 60% of all cities that currently have a million residents or more are at risk of at least one type of major natural disaster, many of them climate-related, and even the most well-organised, highly developed cities have yet to fully plan for these threats. \u201cPeople oftentimes don\u2019t want to have this discussion because it\u2019s associated with an alarmist view of climate change, but it\u2019s worthwhile to consider what catastrophic climate change would mean for habitable space,\u201d says Michail Fragkias, an applied social scientist at Boise State University.&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150901-is-the-world-running-out-of-space",
