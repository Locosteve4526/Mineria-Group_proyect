        "Description/Abstract": "Rural areas throughout the Himalayan region are being transformed by distant demand for caterpillar fungus (Ophiocordyceps sinensis), a parasitic, alpine fungus that has become one of the most valuable biological commodities in the world due to its use in Chinese medicine. Its skyrocketing value has created lucrative new livelihood opportunities for harvesters, but also raised concerns over whether this resource is being harvested sustainably. Here, I will present results from my interdisciplinary investigation of the sustainability of the caterpillar fungus trade, including evidence that climate change and natural resource management institutions are key factors in determining which areas are most vulnerable to overexploitation.",
