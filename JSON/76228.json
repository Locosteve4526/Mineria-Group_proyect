        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;This literature review is being supported by a TRANSFORM (NSF) Research Assistant during the AY 24-25 to reivew 120+ articles and sources focused on human-centered reearch methodologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In collaboration with Assistant Vice President for Research Jana LaRosa, I am developing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Think Big! Human-Centered Research Development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;, a workshop series designed for faculty and graduate students across the Boise State campus. This series will guide faculty as they engage in transformative research and creative work, introducing them to a user-centered toolkit and structured framework that fosters relationships and professional development among peers across disciplines. We aim to empower faculty to pivot, expand, and ultimately converge on innovative ideas and solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;To support interdisciplinary teaching, research, and development, we will apply evidence-based design-thinking methodologies tailored for diverse participants. This approach will enable convergent growth in problem identification and solution generation. Using design-thinking protocols focused on use-inspired, human-centered design, we will cultivate a collaborative cohort of interdisciplinary faculty, helping them chart meaningful next steps in their academic and creative pursuits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Think Big!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; will take a user centered approach to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Expose non-designer participants to use creative techniques, methods, and mindsets to address a wide range of research challenges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;earn more about the roles of both research designer and user in convergent interdisciplinary research and creative activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Identify ways that community engaged projects in user research can lead to social change and greater impact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
