        "Description/Abstract": "The growth and dispersal of Melville\u2019s library and the roles of books and reading in his intellectual and creative experience have occupied a prominent place in Melville scholarship since the pioneering work of Merton M. Sealts, Jr., from the 1940s through the 1990s, and of Wilson Walker Cowen in the 1960s. In the present century, the work of tracking and documenting the recovery of Melville\u2019s books, and of electronically editing his marginalia in surviving volumes, is carried on at Melville\u2019s Marginalia Online. Whereas many important volumes owned by Melville remain lost, copies marked and annotated in his hand continue to resurface, with sporadic impacts of new evidence on scholarship devoted to this thought and craft. Current advancements in digital technology assist and expand our comprehension of old and new evidence, offering significant opportunities for the study of Melville\u2019s reading life.",
