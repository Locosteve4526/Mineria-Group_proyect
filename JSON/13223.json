        "Description/Abstract": "Given the appearance and reappearance of this notion of transaction, interaction and communication across his writings, Dewey can be said to be an important and early contributor to discourses on \u201ctraffic\u201d as an event and as a medium. His wide-ranging and gradually evolving thought offers an opportunity to see how various issues can be configured in terms of dynamic flow and circulation. As McLuhan perceptively noted, \u201cDewey\u201d was in effect \u201creacting against passive print culture [and thus] surf boarding along on the new electronic wave.\u201d ",
