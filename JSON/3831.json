        "Description/Abstract": "A traditional view is that all necessary truths are analytic. A frequent objection is that certain claims of color incompatibility \u2013 e.g., 'Nothing is both red and green all over' \u2013 are necessarily true but not analytic. I argue that this objection to the traditional view fails because such color incompatibility claims are either analytic or contingent.",
