        "Description/Abstract": "For years, teacher education programs have focused considerable effort on teacher knowledge and how to develop the types of knowledge that matter in teacher education candidates. Meanwhile, candidate dispositions for teaching have received little attention, particularly in mathematics courses for candidates. As developers and practitioners of a curriculum intervention designed to support candidates\u2019 mathematical knowledge, we are beginning to see how much disposition towards teaching mathematics matters in a candidate's ability to attend to students' ideas. In this paper we share results from a pilot study investigating the dispositional characteristics elicited in an online video-based curriculum focused on students\u2019 ideas on a figural pattern task. Results indicate that efforts to cultivate secondary candidates' disposition for teaching may have payoffs with respect to both dispositions and knowledge.",
