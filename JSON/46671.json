        "Description/Abstract": "The current mainstream theory for radiation-induced dimensional change of nuclear graphite is based on the notion that interstitially displaced carbon atoms will coalesce into dislocation loops (i.e., additional basal planes). This standard atomic-displacement model has been challenged by theories based on first principles calculations. The so-called \u2018ruck and tuck\u2019 of basal planes has been proposed as an alternative mechanism to explain the observed c-axis expansion under irradiation; however, no such defects have been observed experimentally so far. In this study, the first experimental evidence for the presence of a \u2018ruck and tuck\u2019 defect in high-temperature neutron-irradiated nuclear graphite is presented.",
