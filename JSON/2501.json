        "Description/Abstract": "Anti-idiotypic anti-DNA antibodies (anti-anti-DNA) have previously been described in both patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and healthy individuals. Jerne's hypothesis predicts that such antibodies would bear a paratope reactive with non-sequence specific DNA binding proteins. Here we have explored the notion of a molecular mimicry between anti-anti-DNA antibodies and antibodies to a previously described 28-29 kD cell surface DNA binding molecule. It was shown that affinity purified anti-anti-DNA antibodies inhibit the binding of DNA to cells and that MoAb to the 28-29 kD receptor react with anti-DNA antibodies. These findings indicate that a subset of anti-anti-DNA antibodies are idiotypically related to antibodies reactive with a cell surface DNA binding molecule. It is hypothesized that anti-DNA antibodies may arise when a convergence of genetic and environmental influences favours an unrestrained anti-idiotypic response to cell surface DNA binding molecule(s).",
