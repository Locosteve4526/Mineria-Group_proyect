        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Boise State University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This policy brief attempts to answer the question, &quot;How much impact did gas prices have on voting in Idaho during the 2022 elections?&quot; The answer, it turns out, is that gas prices had a mixed, but likely partisan and economically driven, effect on the vote. I will use as evidence to back this conclusion a series of questions from the recent Idaho Policy Survey, as well as a participant-observer study I have conducted for several years locally. I also have evidence from a national survey on which I had a question asked on gas prices and voting.&lt;/p&gt;",
