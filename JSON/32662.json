        "Description/Abstract": "To form an engaged community of students and faculty members, we created an interactive environment through the exploration and implementation of the Team-Based Learning (TBL) evidence-based instructional practice. In the first semester, the pass rate in TBL sections was 9% higher than the non-TBL sections of the same course. Student perception was overwhelmingly positive and final exam scores showed that without the two midterm exams, they had still learned the same material as traditional lecture sections. However, there is still room for improvement.  Adopting TBL has reminded us that changes are an iterative process and require continual reflection and improvement. Backwards course design and careful planning of pre-reading material are essential for creating effective modules and ensuring students are ready for the Readiness Assurance Process (RAP) and team activities. We are working to apply these strategies to further improve CS1 in the upcoming semesters.",
