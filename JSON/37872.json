        "Description/Abstract": "Despite a history of control measures, many communities in northern Uganda have very high levels of parasite transmission and malaria-associated morbidity and mortality. We report on the inception of a collaborative and multi-faceted\r\nproject conducted in the Katakwi district in northeastern Uganda designed to\r\nrapidly decrease and sustain community-wide parasite burden. The architecture\r\nof this program has in part been guided by simulation, using model strategic\r\napproaches for intervention timing and projected impact. A first phase of the\r\nprogram deploys a sequence of interventions which include both vector control\r\nand chemoprevention, timed for high potential impact and aimed to quickly and\r\nmarkedly reduce transmission. Particular emphasis is laid on the strong synergy between MDA + IRS when deployed simultaneously. A second phase of the program attempts to sustain gains through a community-supported active-case infrastructure. Some progress and simulation-guided results and program design generalizations will be reported.",
