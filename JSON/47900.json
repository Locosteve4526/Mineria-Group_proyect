        "Description/Abstract": "Stress fractures are injuries caused by cumulative, repetitive stress that leads to abnormal bone remodeling. There are two causes of stress fractures, excessive stresses causing weakening of bone material and typical stresses acting on abnormal bone. Stress fractures are more common in certain populations including women, military personnel, high-level athletes, and the middle aged/elderly. Stress fractures have a large socioeconomic impact as they cause prolonged periods away from competition and a significant amount of healthcare spending. A reliable, reproducible method to determine which individuals are most susceptible within the predisposed populations would provide cost-effective prevention strategies. Advanced numerical simulation tools may be key to modeling the mechanical behavior of bones under\ndifferent loading conditions.",
