        "Description/Abstract": "This study investigates the effects of students\u2019 intrinsic motivation and prior knowledge on student achievement in learning Chinese in a game-based learning environment. The study found that both students\u2019 prior knowledge and intrinsic motivation affect their achievements in learning Chinese. Students\u2019 prior knowledge and intrinsic motivation affected each other. Namely, a group low in intrinsic motivation but with higher prior knowledge showed comparatively higher student achievements. This finding suggests that students\u2019 prior knowledge should also be considered while designing and adopting game-based learning in order to engage students with different levels of intrinsic motivation.",
