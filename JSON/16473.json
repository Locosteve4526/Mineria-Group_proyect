        "Description/Abstract": "Climate exerts primary control over vegetation and fire occurrence but landscape structure, vegetation type and density determine fire pattern, frequency and severity (i.e. fire regime), and the nature of fire-related geomorphic response.  To explore these relationships, we compare alluvial charcoal records of fire and fire-related sedimentation with a woodrat midden reconstruction of vegetation at the northern migration front for single-leaf pinyon and Utah juniper at City of Rocks National Reserve (CIRO), south-central Idaho.
