        "Description/Abstract": "This article is titled multicultural literature literally because we wanted to focus on literature that reflects diversity in the pictures and story lines. We felt it was important to call librarians' and teachers' attention to some of these books because they reflect the natural interactions across race that occur with our children and adults. The books we refer to may have the ability to break down racial discrimination in their own subtle ways if we have them available in our libraries or classrooms and share them with our patrons.",
