        "Description/Abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an ongoing public health and criminal legal issue that&lt;br&gt;transcends social boundaries. However, there is a lack of equitable representation of diverse&lt;br&gt;populations who experience IPV in the literature. To garner a holistic knowledge of diverse IPV&lt;br&gt;survivor populations\u2019 experiences with seeking help from the police, the current study utilized a&lt;br&gt;qualitative research synthesis methodology to explore police interactions among six non-&lt;br&gt;normative IPV survivor populations: women with substance use issues, immigrant women,&lt;br&gt;women in rural localities, heterosexual men, racial/ethnic minority women, and lesbian women.&lt;br&gt;Seven electronic databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed articles on IPV survivors;&lt;br&gt;narrative descriptions (qualitative or mixed methods) of their encounters with law enforcement.&lt;br&gt;The final analysis included 26 studies that were then coded with an iterative coding strategy. The&lt;br&gt;analysis uncovered the following themes: (1) revictimization by the police, (2) police negligence,&lt;br&gt;(3) discrimination, (4) cultural differences, and (5) positive experiences. These themes&lt;br&gt;demonstrated that while some experiences with law enforcement were shared between non-&lt;br&gt;normative survivor groups, some experiences were explicitly tied to the identities of the&lt;br&gt;survivors. Recognizing the potential law enforcement has to support survivors, the findings of&lt;br&gt;the current study reiterate the need for ongoing efforts to improve law enforcement knowledge&lt;br&gt;and overall response to IPV, especially for diverse populations of IPV survivors.",
