        "Description/Abstract": "The ability of pore-forming proteins to interact with various analytes has found vast applicability in single molecule sensing and characterization. In spite of their abundance in organisms from all kingdoms of life, only a few pore-forming proteins have been successfully reconstituted in artificial membrane systems for sensing purposes. Lysenin, a pore-forming toxin extracted from the earthworm E. fetida, inserts large conductance nanopores in lipid membranes containing sphingomyelin. Here we show that single lysenin channels may function as stochastic nanosensors by allowing the short cationic peptide angiotensin II to be electrophoretically driven through the conducting pathway. Long-term translocation experiments performed by using large populations of lysenin channels allowed unequivocal identification of the unmodified analyte by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. This investigation demonstrates that lysenin channels have the potential to function as nano-sensing devices capable of single peptide molecule identification and characterization, which may be further extended to other macromolecular analytes.\n",
