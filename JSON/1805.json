        "Description/Abstract": "THIS PAPER IS A STUDY of subject-object relations in British writings about the Indian Uprising of 1857. I focus in particular on accounts vocalizing panic over a colony of objects \u201cbaldly encountered\u201d and \u201cnot quite apprehended\u201d in the context of remembering and remediating traumatic memories of the Uprising. What follows is an exercise in object-oriented investigation, reading depictions of subject-object and object-subject encounters, analyzing matters-of-concern emerging from the events of 1857.",
