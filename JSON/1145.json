        "Description/Abstract": "We give herein analytical formulas for the solution of the Hermite collocation discretization of the unforced steady-state convection-diffusion equation in one spatial dimension and with constant coefficients, defined on a uniform mesh, with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The accuracy of the method is advanced by employing &quot;upstream weighting&quot; of the convective term in an optimal way, avoiding both &quot;smearing&quot; and unwanted oscillations, particularly for large P\u00e9clet numbers. Computational examples illustrate the efficacy of using optimal upstream weighting.",
