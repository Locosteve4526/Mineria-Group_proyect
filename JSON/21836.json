        "Description/Abstract": "Charles Brockden Brown\u2019s 1799 Edgar Huntly famously aims \u201cto exhibit a series of adventures, growing out of the condition of our country,\u201d noting that the \u201cincidents of Indian hostility, and the perils of the western wilderness\u201d are the most appropriate materials for American readers (Brown 3). Scholarship has long focused on the novel\u2019s \u201cwilderness\u201d setting, but only recently have scholars begun to approach Edgar Huntly from an explicitly ecocritical perspective. This essay builds on existing scholarship to address Brown\u2019s novel through the dual lenses of ecocriticism and Gothic studies, examining its representations of place, landscape, and psychology, emphasizing its engagement with anxieties about humanity and animality. \nUntil now, the term \u201cecogothic\u201d has been insufficiently defined; this essay approaches this term understanding the Gothic as a mode (building on the work of Jerrold Hogle and Teresa Goddu) to show how Gothic moments in texts can be read ecocritically. The explicitly Gothic moments in Edgar Huntly depict cultural anxieties not just about \u201cwilderness,\u201d but also about the slippery divide between humanity and animality. Amid all the threats that Huntly encounters, none are more unsettling than realizing that the boundaries between the human and more-than-human world are penetrable and unstable\u2014and may be entirely social constructions. Textually, the novel blurs boundaries between the Delaware Indians, \u201csavage\u201d panthers, and the sleepwalking Clithero Edny, and eventually Huntly finds himself part of this elision of categories\u2014where \u201chuman\u201d and \u201canimal\u201d collapse. In Huntly\u2019s transformation, we see playing out Stacy Alaimo\u2019s new materialist concept that \u201cthe human is always intermeshed with the more-than-human world,\u201d and that \u201cthe substance of the human is ultimately inseparable from \u2018the environment\u2019\u201d (2). This reading of Edgar Huntly, finally, shows how the idea of the body as nature, as environment, is a specter that haunts the otherwise rational, enlightened late-eighteenth-century subject.\nRole:  Principal",
