        "Description/Abstract": "Experiential learning allows students to learn beyond the walls of a classroom by establishing a learning environment best suited for learners to gain knowledge. Although a powerful learning process, the practice of using experiential learning projects in CM curricula are challenging due to logistical, financial, and course time constraints. The intent of this experiential learning project is to provide invaluable learning experience for students in the Boise State University Department of Construction Management (BSU CM), reinforcing skills taught in the classroom, and allowing the students to practice learned skills in a \u201creal world\u201d setting.",
