        "Description/Abstract": "The Roman city of Libarna has the potential to add greater understanding of the social and cultural development of urban life in northwest Italy, a relatively liminal geographical area between peninsular Roman Italy and its provinces. The Libarna Archaeological Project (LAP) used several geophysical survey methods to investigate Libarna\u2019s urban plan, which is only currently known in fragments due to two hundred years of sporadic excavation and modern development. During a 3-week pilot season LAP was able to begin filling in the map of Libarna\u2019s urban area using resistivity, magnetometry, GPR, and drone photogrammetry.",
