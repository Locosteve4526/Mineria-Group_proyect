        "Description/Abstract": "Aged individuals and astronauts experience bone loss despite rigorous physical activity. Bone mechanoresponse is in-part regulated by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that respond to mechanical stimuli. Direct delivery of low intensity vibration (LIV) recovers MSC proliferation in senescence and simulated microgravity models, indicating that age-related reductions in mechanical signal delivery within bone marrow may contribute to declining bone mechanoresponse. To answer this question, we developed a 3D bone marrow analog that controls trabecular geometry, marrow mechanics and external stimuli. Validated finite element (FE) models were developed to quantify strain environment within hydrogels during LIV. Bone marrow analogs with gyroid-based trabeculae of bone volume fractions (BV/TV) corresponding to adult (25%) and aged (13%) mice were printed using polylactic acid (PLA). MSCs encapsulated in migration-permissive hydrogels within printed trabeculae showed robust cell populations on both PLA surface and hydrogel within a week. Following 14 days of LIV treatment (1g, 100 Hz, 1 hour/day), type-I collagen and F-actin were quantified for the cells in the hydrogel fraction. While LIV increased all measured outcomes, FE models predicted higher von Mises strains for the 13% BV/TV groups (0.2%) when compared to the 25% BV/TV group (0.1%). Despite increased strains, collagen-I and F-actin measures remained lower in the 13% BV/TV groups when compared to 25% BV/TV counterparts, indicating that cell response to LIV does not depend on hydrogel strains and that bone volume fraction (i.e. available bone surface) directly affects cell behavior in the hydrogel phase independent of the external stimuli. Overall, bone marrow analogs offer a robust and repeatable platform to study bone mechanobiology.",
