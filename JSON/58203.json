        "Description/Abstract": "Neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can aid in studying the impacts of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems on one another. These computational models facilitate studies investigating mechanisms and treatment of musculoskeletal and neurodegenerative conditions. In this study, we present a predictive NMS model that uses an embedded neural architecture within a finite element (FE) framework to simulate muscle activation. A previously developed neuromuscular model of a motor neuron was embedded into a simple FE musculoskeletal model. Input stimulation profiles from literature were simulated in the FE NMS model to verify effective integration of the software platforms. Motor unit recruitment and rate coding capabilities of the model were evaluated. The integrated model reproduced previously published output muscle forces with an average error of 0.0435\u00a0N. The integrated model effectively demonstrated motor unit recruitment and rate coding in the physiological range based upon motor unit discharge rates and muscle force output. The combined capability of a predictive NMS model within a FE framework can aid in improving our understanding of how the nervous and musculoskeletal systems work together. While this study focused on a simple FE application, the framework presented here easily accommodates increased complexity in the neuromuscular model, the FE simulation, or both.",
