        "Description/Abstract": "Teaching online poses unique challenges for keeping participants engaged. To enhance the effectiveness of&lt;br&gt;virtual childbirth education, this article explores how active learning techniques can guide the design of&lt;br&gt;online prenatal classes. Active learning involves encouraging class participants to process and engage with&lt;br&gt;ideas as the instructor presents them in class, rather than just hearing about concepts through lectures.&lt;br&gt;This article draws from pedagogical literature on active learning and applies its key components to the&lt;br&gt;needs of childbirth instructors in an online setting. Specific recommendations for activities to involve&lt;br&gt;participants and create lasting learning are also provided for synchronous online classes.",
