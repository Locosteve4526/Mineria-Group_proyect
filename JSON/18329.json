        "Description/Abstract": "Since Columbus\u2019s first encounter with Amerindians, the feather has become one of the predominant descriptive features of American indigenous peoples. Over the years, feathered objects were exported to Europe for adorning hats, dresses, military helmets, tourney and procession horses; feathers were collected in curiosity cabinets, headdresses were used in theatrical productions, Mexican feather paintings decorated aristocratic walls, and Catholic bishops in Europe wore Mexican feather miters. Feathers did not simply improve the quality of life in Europe, they altered it, and altered the people. In this talk I will consider how the New World feather retains its original American meaning of divinity in Christian-themed feather paintings and English literature, emphasizing how Amerindians, particularly from Mexico, ultimately indigenize European culture and art.",
