        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Wikipedia has evolved greatly in its 23 year existence, including the development of several open collaboration projects on the web, such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiedu.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Wiki Education&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;, which is dedicated to \u201cengaging students and academics to improve Wikipedia, enrich student learning, and build a more informed public.\u201d A primary objective of this proposed workshop is to introduce instructors to the potential uses of Wikipedia in the classroom, examining the benefits and challenges of its use through real world examples. We plan to demonstrate how Wikipedia is being used for fact checking, critical thinking, and experiential learning. We\u2019ll also outline the training offered to instructors by Wiki Edu, which includes training modules, webinars, and a dashboard that works to coordinate collaboration and learning. We\u2019ll close with time for instructors to explore aspects of Wikipedia and discuss with their peers how Wikipedia might be integrated into their classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outcomes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;After attending this workshop learners will be able to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; Confirm Wikipedia as a valid classroom learning tool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; Integrate Wikipedia into curriculum to achieve a variety of learning objectives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; Describe how a Wikipedia assignment empowers students through providing them with agency and the potential for enacting real world change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;",
