        "Description/Abstract": "U-Mo fuel has been developed for application in high performance research reactors. Previous transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations of neutron irradiated U-Mo fuel have revealed a fission gas bubble superlattice [1]. However, the chemical compositions of the fission gas bubbles and the matrix have not been accurately measured. The number density and volume fraction of the fission gas bubbles have been estimated by TEM investigations, however, these values need to be verified by a three-dimensional technique. \nAtom probe tomography (APT) offers simultaneously high spatial resolution and high analytical sensitivity. APT is a powerful tool to advance the understanding of microstructure of nuclear fuels and materials at the atomic level. In general, the application of APT in characterizing nuclear fuels has been extremely limited [2], and previously there has not been any APT study of neutron irradiated U-Mo fuel.\nThis study is the first APT investigation of neutron irradiated U-Mo fuel. The data collection during the APT experiment ran well, and large datasets containing on the order of 100 million atoms were collected. Various fission products were identified in the APT samples, and the overall compositions in the APT analysis volumes were obtained. Fission gas bubble superlattice was seen in some orientations. The chemical composition, number density and volume fraction of fission gas bubbles and the chemical composition of the matrix were measured.  The distribution of solid fission products and their relations to fission gas bubbles were also obtained. \nHowever, the results obtained from APT are very different from those from TEM.  There are challenges associated with using APT to accurately measure characteristics of gas bubbles. The data acquisition and data analysis need to be improved, and new methods for data analysis may need to be developed. The challenges will be discussed. ",
