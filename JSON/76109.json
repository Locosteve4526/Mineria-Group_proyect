        "Description/Abstract": "There are powerful motivations for and barriers to successful responsible domestic mining. What are the roles education (particularly college education) can play in addressing these motivations and barriers? We have a model (interdisciplinary reciprocating education) of how such education might work that we would like to test. To do so requires partners. In this presentation we will i) share our model and its motivations\u00a0 ii) describe existing plans for implementing and testing our model (including our partnership with the Idaho Mining Advocacy Project, IMAP) and iii) open dialog about how to improve both the model and its testing.",
