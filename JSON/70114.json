        "Description/Abstract": "Postoperative delirium is a serious complication, particularly in older adults with hip fractures. Using the 2019 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data file, we performed multiple regression analyses to compare risk factors for postoperative delirium in hip fracture patients with and without dementia. Preoperative delirium and mobility aid use were common risk factors in both groups. However, differential effects were observed for other factors. Pathological fracture increased delirium risk in patients with dementia but had a protective effect in those without dementia. In patients with dementia, American Society of Anesthesiology score IV/V was identified as a risk factor, whereas advanced age, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, weight loss, sepsis, elevated international normalized ratio, and serum creatinine level were additional risk factors in patients without dementia. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex relationship among dementia, hip fractures, and postoperative delirium. Identifying specific risk factors for each group can inform tailored interventions and preventive strategies. Further research is needed to validate and expand these findings, ultimately improving care and outcomes. [(12), 25-30.].",
