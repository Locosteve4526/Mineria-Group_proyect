        "Description/Abstract": "Community-acquired pressure injuries (CAPIs) are present among approximately 3% to 8% of patients admitted to acute care hospitals. In the critical care population, little is known about hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) development among patients with CAPIs because most studies exclude patients with CAPIs. The purpose of our study was to determine the incidence of HAPI development and the associated risk factors among surgical critical care patients with CAPIs.",
