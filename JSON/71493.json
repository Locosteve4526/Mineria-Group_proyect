        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we begin by attempting to develop reliable measures for NE and OE. In Study 1 we develop and test items to measure NE and OE as individual constructs. While our items loaded reasonably well, we were not satisfied with the validity of a number of the items across contexts. In Study 2, we attempted to develop an entrepreneurial motivation construct with NE and OE at either end of the spectrum. The items in this study did not load reliably and, unsurprisingly, indicate that there are two underlying factors. In Study 3, we build on recent theoretical advancements (Coffman &amp; Sunny, 2021; Dencker, Bacq, Gruber &amp; Haas, 2021), and test the efficacy of a model based on Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, along with five outcomes that expand on necessity and opportunity: subsistence, temporary, self-employment, commercial and aspirational entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;",
