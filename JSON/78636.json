        "Description/Abstract": "Competing Forms of Value in Two Later Works of August Wilson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acts of transgression and exchange lie at the center of August Wilson\u2019s Gem of the Ocean and Seven Guitars. In the case of Gem, Citizen Barlow must confront his crime of silence when another man, Garrett Brown, is charged with the theft that he himself committed. In addition, the paper boat made from Aunt Ester\u2019s bill of sale is a vehicle that transports Citizen on his redemptive journey to the City of Bones. As boat, the bill of sale is a metaphorical vehicle bearing two contradictory tenors, for it signifies both Aunt Ester\u2019s dehumanization as a chattel slave and Citizen\u2019s rehumanizing journey through the Middle Passage to union with his ancestors in the City of Bones. In the case of Seven Guitars, blues musician Floyd Barton steals enough money to redeem his pawned guitar and finance his trip to Chicago to promote his recording career. His transgression is compounded by another when the character Hedley murders Floyd and seizes the stolen money. Hedley believes Floyd to be Buddy Bolden, the messenger whom he dreams will come as a representative of his father to restore his patrimony. In each play, Wilson aligns figurative with financial or economic exchanges to transform transgression from fortuitous action into something meaningful. The plots of both plays are organized around competing economies in order to emphasize the conflicts between different forms of value. &lt;br&gt;In Gem, Wilson dramatizes Citizen\u2019s redemption by transforming the meaning of the two pennies Aunt Ester requires him to find and bring back. While Aunt Ester tells Black Mary that they are arbitrary parts of Citizen\u2019s quest, they later pay for not only Citizen\u2019s but Solly\u2019s entry into the City of Bones. Citizen\u2019s redemption and Solly\u2019s arson conflict with Caesar\u2019s brusque law-and-order self-reliance. In Seven Guitars, the transgression of Hedley\u2019s murder displaces that of Floyd\u2019s theft and thereby redefines it: first, the money Hedley gains will provide means to support himself and Ruby as well as a legacy for Ruby\u2019s child. Second, as twice-stolen blood money, the treasure is the residue of Floyd\u2019s original action, a sum that will not tally with the hopes it was meant to realize. By reminding the audience of Floyd\u2019s violent death, the money symbolizes the destruction of his dreams of becoming a recording artist. Floyd\u2019s failure haunts Hedley\u2019s success. The bluesman\u2019s efforts are ironically transfigured by the fulfillment of Hedley\u2019s exacting vision of money falling from his hands like ashes. In Hedley\u2019s ancestral vision, the money goes from one hand to another, but it also goes away, changing from money into ashes. Hedley\u2019s dream attests to the value of his relationship with his father, but by going up in smoke, it also realistically faces the fact that money is all the harder to come by in a racially unjust society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeff Westover&lt;br&gt;English Department&lt;br&gt;Boise State University&lt;br&gt;1910 University Drive&lt;br&gt;Boise, ID 83703&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;jeffreywestover@boisestate.edu&lt;br&gt;208/426-1232&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NB This is the second time I have posted this activity.
