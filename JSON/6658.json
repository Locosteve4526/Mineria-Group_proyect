        "Description/Abstract": "The paper deals with initial problems for differential-functional equations. The sufficient conditions for the existence of some monotone function sequences {un}, {vn} are given. The sequences are uniformly convergent to the solution y of the given problem. For every n the functions un, vn are the solutions of some linear initial problems. The error estimation of the approximate solutions is given. The Caratheodory solutions of the differential-functional equations are considered. The differential inequalities technique is applied.",
