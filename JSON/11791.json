The IBCP will also strive to implement strategic management and conservation efforts that contribute to the achievement of high priority regional and continental bird objectives aligned with national and state bird conservation initiatives and Idaho\u2019s State Wildlife Action Plan. The poster will serve to introduce GBLCC attendees to the IBCP, the working groups we\u2019ve formed, and our accomplishments to date.",
