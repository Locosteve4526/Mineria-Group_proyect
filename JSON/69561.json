        "Description/Abstract": "Transgender/nonbinary (trans/NB) patients face stigma in health care settings. Health care professionals' training on trans/NB issues has historically been lacking. Interprofessional education (IPE) provides an opportunity to improve knowledge and attitudes across health care professions. The purpose of this study was to: (a) describe the development and implementation of an IPE workshop on gender-affirming care through a trans/NB community-academic partnership and (b) examine the impact of the workshop on student knowledge and attitudes. The workshop included a slide presentation on basic terminology and concepts, video clips of trans/NB patientprovider interactions, facilitated discussions of affirming practices, and a trans/NB panel. Nonparametric statistical analysis of pre- and post-survey data from 58 workshop participants measured changes in student knowledge and attitudes. Students demonstrated statistically significant improvements in knowledge (=-12.72; &lt;0.01) and interpersonal comfort (=-2.06; &lt;0.05) as well as sex and gender beliefs (=-3.06; &lt;0.05) on subscales from the Transgender Attitudes &amp; Beliefs Scale. The results demonstrated no differences on the human value subscale (=-0.69; =0.49) or on health care professional questions (=-1.23; =0.23). A community-academic partnership developed and implemented this brief interactive educational intervention, which can improve both knowledge and attitudes about trans/NB individuals' health among health professional students.",
