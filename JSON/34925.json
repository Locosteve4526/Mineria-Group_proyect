        "Description/Abstract": "We compare in this study two approaches for the pre-\r\nprocessing of printed documents. The first approach is\r\nbased on non-local means while the second is based on\r\nTotal Variation. Both approaches have been recently\r\napplied to image restoration. We apply these two ap-\r\nproaches to printed document sets from various peri-\r\nods. And we evaluate their effectiveness through char-\r\nacter recognition performance, using an open source\r\nOCR. Our results show that for each document set,\r\none or both pre-processings improve character recogni-\r\ntion accuracy over recognition without preprocessing.\r\nHigher accuracies are obtained with Non-local means\r\nwhen characters have a low level of degradation since\r\nthey can be restored by similar neighboring parts of non-\r\ndegraded characters. The Total Variation approach is\r\nmore effective when characters are highly degraded and\r\ncan only be restored through modeling instead of neigh-\r\nboring data.",
