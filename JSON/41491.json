        "Description/Abstract": "Introduction: Adding cereal to a baby\u2019s bottle is associated with childhood obesity and many caregivers add cereal to make a baby full.  Study purpose: identify modifiable factors and priority populations for infant feeding interventions. Methods: Longitudinal data from WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study II, collected from 2013-2015, were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among 4367 caregivers, two-week prevalence of adding cereal to babies\u2019 bottles in months 1, 3, and 5 was 1.88%, 8.66%, and 20.13%, respectively. The most common reason was \u201cto make him/her full\u201d. Among caregivers who added cereal to a baby\u2019s bottle in months 1, 3, or 5 (n=1155), factors associated with greater odds of adding cereal to make the baby full, in bivariate analyses, include Black/African American race, younger age of mother, and vaginal delivery.  Factors associated in bivariate analyses with lower odds of adding cereal to make the baby full include parity (primiparas v. multiparas), and agreeing breast milk is all a baby needs. When considered together in a multivariable model, the only factors significantly associated with adding cereal to make the baby full include Black/African American v. other races (OR=1.37, 95%CI:1.02-1.84) and agreeing breast milk is all a baby needs v. disagreeing (OR=0.70, 95%CI:0.52-0.94). Discussion: To address social disparities and childhood obesity among participating WIC infants, priority populations for interventions curbing adding cereal to a baby\u2019s bottle to make him/her full include those who identify as Black/African American.  Interventions should include attempts to modify caregiver perceptions regarding the completeness of breast milk. ",
