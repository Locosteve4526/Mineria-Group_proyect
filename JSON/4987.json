        "Description/Abstract": "Previous studies found that student health is adversely affected by examination stress. We compared faculty and student stress and health during midterm examination week. Although faculty and students reported similarly high levels of stress, fatigue, anger, vigor, and negative moods, faculty reported fewer physical health symptoms and less tension, depression, and confusion. These results may be due to differences in coping strategies. Faculty need to be aware that they are not immune to health-related issues at midterm examination time.",
