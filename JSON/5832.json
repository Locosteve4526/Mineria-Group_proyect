        "Description/Abstract": "Objective: To examine the effect of the three levels of the Sex Can Wait curriculum series on the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of students relative to sexuality. Methods: Students from eight school districts participated in the curriculum. Students from seven other school districts served as a comparison group. Results: The treatment group outscored the comparison group as follows: (upper elementary) knowledge, attitudes and attitudes toward abstinence (p&lt;.05); (middle school) knowledge and decision-making behaviors (p&lt;.05); (high school) no significant differences. Conclusion: Despite limitations, results should be encouraging for persons interested in helping young people postpone sexual involvement.",
