        "Description/Abstract": "Physical education teacher education (PETE) is one of many disciplines in higher education responsible for preparing future educators. Education in general is increasingly politicized by public officials and scrutinized by the media, and the programs that train tomorrow's public school teachers are no exception. Between the politics that shape many of the choices in teacher preparation and teachers' own sense of what needs to be taught, PETE faculty struggle to answer the question, &quot;How can we deliver the best possible teacher education program to our undergraduates?&quot;",
