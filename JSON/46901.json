        "Description/Abstract": "Writing amid the 1929 depression, pioneer Austrian school economist Ludwig von Mises spelled out what has become microeconomic orthodoxy regarding crisis formation. Capitalism, he argued, was defined by equilibrium. Crises, therefore, were caused by market distortion\u2014in particular, the ways labor unions, unemployment relief, and minimum wage laws conspired against the \u201cnatural\u201d tendency for wages to fall low enough to facilitate full employment. In contrast, Mises argued, a truly free market would have entailed wage cuts instead of layoffs; laborers would simply say \u201cBetter a lower wage, than no wage at all.\u201d\n\nWas Mises right? Despite his still tremendous following, historically, Misesian prescriptions have had little bearing on historical reality. In fact, workers have often been quite resistant to the idea of taking any job\u2014no matter how low paying or undignified\u2014even when on the brink of privation. Dignity is an intangible and slippery concept. It may seem like poor ideological adhesive for historical theses, but my own research on industrial decline in Massachusetts shows how workers\u2019 subjective sense of \u201cdignified labor\u201d repeatedly kept them from taking this Misesian bargain and opting for economic optimization. I show how local business leaders frequently wrestled with a phenomenon they found utterly perplexing\u2014the so-called \u201cjob paradox\u201d: surging rates of unemployment and unfilled jobs (ironically clustered in \u201cdeindustrializing\u201d sectors). The problem, of course, was that workers were more discerning than expected. Historians too have implicitly reproduced Misesian logic, missing how workers\u2019 own choices\u2014and their desire for \u201cdignity\u201d\u2014helped hasten industrial decline.",
