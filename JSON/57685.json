        "Description/Abstract": "My brief talk and longer discussion will focus on Madeline Miller\u2019s recent novel, Circe. Circle reimagines the story of a minor goddess and sorceress best known for turning sailors into pigs and having an affair with Odysseus in The Odyssey. Circe also plays a minor role in myths about the Minotaur\u2019s origins and Jason and the Golden Fleece. Claire Messud describes Miller\u2019s novel as a \u201chighly psychologized, redemptive and ultimately exculpatory account\u201d of Circe\u2019s adventures. Miller\u2019s Circe begins life as an overlooked child, grows into a petulant teenager, and then matures into a loving mother of her son by Odysseus. Not only is Miler\u2019s novel a feminist revision of myth and epic, but it's also just a great story. As Massud writes, like a \u201cgood children\u2019s book, it engrosses and races along at a clip, eliciting excitement and emotion along the way.\u201d My talk and the discussion afterward will explore what happens when stories focusing on men\u2019s greatness get retold from a female perspective.\n \nClaire Messud quotations from Review of Circe: \u201cNew York Times\u201d May 28, 2018\n",
