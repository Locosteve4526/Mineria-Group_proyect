        "Description/Abstract": "Librarians around the world are working to bring down barriers and make content openly accessible on the web.  As research and other creative works are made available, not only do these efforts benefit society as a whole, patrons have also come to expect that web-based content is free.  However few patrons understand their obligations regarding intellectual property and copyrights.  \n\nWorking with patrons and finding ways to help them respect the rights of copyright holders offers librarians unique opportunities to serve their community.  This presentation will highlight the types of open access content now available, key issues that patrons face when using this content, and ways that librarians can help their patrons respect the rights of copyright holders while utilizing open access content.  \n",
