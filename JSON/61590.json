        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;A number of studies have examined park visitation patterns and consumer preferences using available national and state park visitation data. However, municipal park visitation remains largely understudied due to the difficulty and costliness associated with data collection and analysis. This study utilizes high frequency mobile device location data to measure changes in visitation to municipal and state parks and other outdoor recreation points of interest (POIs) after COVID-19 mask mandates were instituted. We exploit spatial and temporal variation in COVID-19 mandates at the county level in the U.S. state of Idaho. We find an increase in POI visitation in areas without mask mandates. Visitation rates were approximately seven percent lower in areas with a mask mandate compared to non-mandate counties. Our research brings insight on the behavioural response to restrictions and on recreational choice behaviour.&lt;/span&gt;",
