        "Description/Abstract": "The northern Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho contain granitoid  rocks that are the same age as the Cretaceous western                      border zone of the Idaho batholith to the north of  the Snake River Plain. They contain a well-developed and consistently  oriented                      020\u00b0 foliation, zircon yielding U-Pb dates of ca.  160\u201348 Ma, and initial 87Sr/86Sr isotopic  compositions that show a steep west-to-east transition in values from  0.704 to 0.708 over a distance of ?30 km.                      The rocks of the northern Owyhee Mountains are  interpreted to be the southward continuation (Owyhee segment) of the  western                      Idaho shear zone. Similar to a well-studied section  of the western Idaho shear zone by McCall (McCall segment), the Owyhee                      segment displays steep foliation and lineation  orientations, deformation of 98\u201390 Ma plutons, steep Sr isotopic  gradients,                      and syntectonic tonalite intrusions. However, the  Owyhee segment has three major differences from the McCall segment: (1)                      significantly less well-developed solid-state  strain fabric foliations; (2) trend of 020\u00b0 rather than 000\u00b0; and (3) a  wider                      transition zone in initial Sr ratios from 0.704 to  0.708. We present a simple tectonic model to explain these differences,                      assuming a 20\u00b0 along-zone difference in the initial  orientation of the western margin of the Laurentia, a rigid-body  collision,                      homogeneous material behavior, and transpressional  kinematics. For the Owyhee segment, the model predicts a lower  oblique-convergence                      angle, less convergent displacement, more dextral  transcurrent displacement, and an overall lower finite strain relative  to                      the McCall segment.",
