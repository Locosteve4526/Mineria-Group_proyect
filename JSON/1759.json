        "Description/Abstract": "Many authors have suggested that the negative effects of roads on animals\nare largely owing to traffic noise. Although suggestive, most past studies\nof the effects of road noise on wildlife were conducted in the presence of\nthe other confounding effects of roads, such as visual disturbance, collisions\nand chemical pollution among others. We present, to our knowledge, the\nfirst study to experimentally apply traffic noise to a roadless area at a landscape\nscale\u2014thus avoiding the other confounding aspects of roads present\nin past studies. We replicated the sound of a roadway at intervals\u2014alternating\n4 days of noise on with 4 days off\u2014during the autumn migratory period\nusing a 0.5 km array of speakers within an established stopover site in\nsouthern Idaho. We conducted daily bird surveys along our \u2018Phantom\nRoad\u2019 and in a nearby control site. We document over a one-quarter decline\nin bird abundance and almost complete avoidance by some species between\nnoise-on and noise-off periods along the phantom road and no such effects\nat control sites\u2014suggesting that traffic noise is a major driver of effects of\nroads on populations of animals.",
