        "Description/Abstract": "While you might be used to your writing teachers grading each of your essays individually, some of your writing instructors in college might evaluate your essays a little differently.  Instead, your instructor might ask you, at the end of the term, to collect your best writing for the class, essays that have been revised, workshopped, and polished based on what you've learned during the entire course.  You might collect them in a folder or notebook.  Then, your instructor might grade this collection of essays as a whole, rather than individually assign a grade.  In fact, if you are reading this section, it is probably because your instructor will be using this type of evaluation, something called a writing portfolio.",
