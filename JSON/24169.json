        "Description/Abstract": "We conducted bird surveys on 10 point count transects during June of 2012 to continue breeding season\nbird monitoring routes in Craters of the Moon Monument and the Preserve (CRMO). We detected a total\nof 2084 individuals of 81 species on 176 point counts. The 10 most numerous bird species (actually 11\nbecause of a tie for 10th) were Brewer\u2019s Sparrow (n=380), Rock Wren (221), Western Meadowlark (186),\nSpotted Towhee (135), Green-tailed Towhee (89), Mourning Dove (78), Sage Thrasher (62), Western\nTanager (57), Brown-headed Cowbird (55), Vesper Sparrow (53), and Violet-green Swallow (53). Only\nBrewer\u2019s Sparrow, Rock Wren, and Mourning Dove were detected on all ten transects. Several other\nwidespread species were detected on seven or more transects, including Northern Flicker, Say\u2019s Phoebe,\nCommon Raven, Western Tanager, Western Meadowlark, and Brown-headed Cowbird.\n",
