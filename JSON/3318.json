        "Description/Abstract": "This third and final 'Geographies of food' review is based on an online  blog conversation provoked by the first and second                      reviews in the series (Cook et al., 2006; 2008a).  Authors of the work featured in these reviews \u2014 plus others whose work  was                      not but should have been featured \u2014 were invited to  respond to them, to talk about their own and other people's work, and                      to enter into conversations about \u2014 and in the  process review \u2014 other/new work within and beyond what could be called 'food                      geographies'. These conversations were coded,  edited, arranged, discussed and rearranged to produce a fragmentary,  multi-authored                      text aiming to convey the rich and multi-stranded  content, breadth and character of ongoing food studies research within  and                      beyond geography.",
