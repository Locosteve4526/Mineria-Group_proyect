        "Description/Abstract": "In 2008, the works of the Bengali artist Nandalal Bose (1882-1966) enjoyed a rare North American museum tour, first at the San Diego Museum of Art and then at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In this first major international excursion, Bose?s works were celebrated as an exemplar of the new modern visual language adopted by nationalist artists as they rejected Europeanized academic techniques in vogue around the turn of the twentieth century. Along with stalwarts like Abanindranath Tagore, Asit Haldar and Kshitindranath Majumdar, the 'swadeshi' (indigenous) artists marked an emphatic turn to revive an \u201eIndian? aesthetic that has been seen to direct the course of modern Indian art since the early twentieth century.",
