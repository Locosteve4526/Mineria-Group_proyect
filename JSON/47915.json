        "Description/Abstract": "Although the concept of mindsets is relatively ubiquitous in the common press and well-studied in the education literature, the concept of a growth mindset, rooted in implicit theories (Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988), is less represented in human resource development (HRD) scholarly literature. Given that absence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of a growth mindset on HRD outcomes. To achieve this purpose, we conducted a scoping literature review including research conducted globally and in a wide variety of organizations. Based on the empirical findings, we discussed three categories of HRD outcomes of mindsets: (a) individual-level outcomes (e.g., work engagement, creativity, task performance, job satisfaction), (b)\ndyadic-level outcomes (e.g., supervisor-employee relationship and conflict resolution), and (c)\norganizational-level outcomes (e.g., organizational citizenship behaviors and organizational\ngrowth mindset). We synthesize several suggestions for growth mindset interventions\nemphasizing career development, training and development, and organizational development for\nHRD practitioners. Research implications and future research suggestions for HRD scholars are\npresented.",
