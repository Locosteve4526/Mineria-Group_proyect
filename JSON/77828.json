        "Description/Abstract": "Purpose&lt;br&gt;The purpose of this practice brief is to provide guidance on\u00a0how collecting and using data in a Tier 3 data system can\u00a0benefit individual student-focused teams, Tier 3 school-level teams, and district PBIS teams. The use of data for decision-making is a critical feature of any effective multi-tiered system of\u00a0support (Chaparro et al., 2022), as it is associated with improved student outcomes (Pentimonti et al., 2017). At Tier 3, making sound\u00a0decisions about the efficacy of individualized behavior support\u00a0interventions can be complex and challenging in that it often requires\u00a0that teams use multiple sources of student progress monitoring and\u00a0implementation data simultaneously (Bruhn et al., 2020). Thus, one\u00a0of the first steps toward effective and efficient data-based decision-making at Tier 3 is ensuring that reliable and valid student-level and\u00a0staff implementation data are readily available to team members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strickland-Cohen, M.K., Iovannone, R., Conley, K., St. Joseph, S., Hirsch, S., &amp; Putnam, R.
