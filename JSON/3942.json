        "Description/Abstract": "Garnet geochronology was used to provide the first direct measurement of the timing of eclogitization in the central Himalaya. Lu\u2013Hf dates from garnet separates in one relict eclogite from the Arun River Valley in eastern Nepal indicate an age of 20.7 \u00b1 0.4 Ma, significantly younger than ultra-high pressure eclogites from the western Himalaya, reflecting either different origins or substantial time lags in tectonics along strike. Four proximal garnet amphibolites from structurally lower horizons are 14\u201315 Ma, similar to post-eclogitization ages published for rocks along strike in southern Tibet. P\u2013T calculations indicate three metamorphic episodes for the eclogite: i) eclogite-facies metamorphism at  670 \u00b0C and ? 15 kbar at 23\u201316 Ma; ii) a peak-T granulite event at  780 \u00b0C and 12 kbar; and iii) late-stage amphibolite-facies metamorphism at  675 \u00b0C and 6 kbar at  14 Ma. The garnet amphibolites were metamorphosed at  660 \u00b0C. Three models are considered to explain the observed P\u2013T\u2013t evolution. The first assumes that the Main Himalayan Thrust (basal thrust of the Himalayan thrust system) cuts deeper at Arun than elsewhere. While conceptually the simplest, this model has difficulty explaining both the granulite-facies overprint and the pulse of exhumation between 25 and 14 Ma. A second model assumes that (aborted) subduction, slab breakoff, and ascent of India's leading edge occurred diachronously:  50 Ma in the western Himalaya,  25 Ma in the central Himalaya of Nepal, and presumably later in the eastern Himalaya. This model explains the P\u2013T\u2013t path, particularly heating during initial exhumation, but implies significant along-strike diachroneity, which is generally lacking in other features of the Himalaya. A third model assumes repeated loss of mantle lithosphere, first by slab breakoff at  50 Ma, and again by delamination at  25 Ma; this model explains the P\u2013T\u2013t path, but requires geographically restricted tectonic behavior at Arun. The P\u2013T\u2013t history of the Arun eclogites may imply a change in the physical state of the Himalayan metamorphic wedge at 16\u201325 Ma, ultimately giving rise to the Main Central Thrust by 15\u201316 Ma.",
