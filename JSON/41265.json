Whether it was a poorly attended program, a new instructional method that was ineffective, or getting started on professional development requirements, sharing our experiences of failure with each other in a safe and accepting space can be cathartic and informative. See what skeletons we have hiding in our closets, and learn how showing yours the light of day might be the most inspiring connection you make for yourself, your colleagues, and your library!",
