        "Description/Abstract": "During June of 2002, Boise State University conducted its Archaeological Field School at the Swenson site (10- EL-1417) near King Hill, Idaho. The opportunity to work at the site was made possible by Harry Knox and Pamela Swenson, owners of River Ranch on which the site is located, approximately 1/4 mile west of King Hill. Situated on the north side terrace overlooking the Snake River, the site is located approximately one mile west of Clover Creek. Its location near Clover Creek and the Bell Mare basalt quarry (Plew and Chavarria 1995) provided an opportunity to further explore the range of occupations within the middle Snake River corridor.",
