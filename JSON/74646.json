        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The Queen Charlotte Fault (QCF), forming a mostly transform boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates offshore Vancouver and southeastern Alaska, experiences rapid deformation at approximately 55 mm/year. This makes it one of the fastest-slipping continental-oceanic transform systems globally. Transpressional deformation occurs along the fault, this is controlled by variations in fault strike with respect to plate motion leading to increasing degrees of convergence along strike from north to south. The National Science Foundation-funded Transform Obliquity on the Queen Charlotte Fault and Earthquake Study (TOQUES) gathered new multichannel seismic reflection data along a ~450 km fault section in 2021. This work focuses on the northern area, site of the 2013 Mw 7.5 Craig, Alaska earthquake. Aftershock sequences suggest that the main QCF dips eastwards or active fault strands exist within the North American plate. We present seismic profiles crossing the 2013 epicentral region, examining fault zone architecture, crustal deformation mechanisms, and deep structural relationships. The sections reveal a series of normal faults within the Pacific crust, a slightly dipping eastwards Pacific basement, and sediments containing multiple vertical faults at the base of the continental slope. The main QCF trace is located on the continental slope. Mid-slope basins record several deformation stages and host multiple vertical faults. On the North American plate continental shelf, we see glacially truncated, east-dipping strata and minor seafloor sediment deformation. All our observations suggest that strike-slip deformation may be distributed across multiple structures.&lt;/p&gt;",
