        "Description/Abstract": "Several case studies observed that the lateral ankle sprain resulted from a sudden increase in ankle inversion accompanied by internal rotation. However, without sufficient ankle kinetics and muscle activity information in the literature, the detailed mechanism of ankle sprain is still unrevealed. The purpose of our case report is to present 2 accidental ankle giving way incidents for participants with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and compare to their normal trials with data of kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography (EMG).",
