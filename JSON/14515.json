        "Description/Abstract": "We discuss the problem of constructing a generating set of links, which spans a Homfl\npty skein module of an orientable\n3-manifold. This problem has been solved for cylinders over surfaces by Przytycki but not much is known for general\n3-manifolds. Using Heegard decomposition it becomes a difficult combinatorial problem. We develop some ideas how the\nextension of the problem to the relative case together with gluing properties of skein modules could be helpful.",
