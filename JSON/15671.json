        "Description/Abstract": "We explore three new algorithms for choice of scaling or regularization parameter in Total Variation denoising. TV regularization is viewed as an M-estimator and it is assumed to converge to a well defined limit even if the probability model is not correctly specified. The Discrepancy Principle, a modified version of the chi-squared method for Tikhonov regularization and an empirically Bayesian approach are implemented and compared on benchmark problems in digital image processing.",
