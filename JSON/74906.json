        "Description/Abstract": "Short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA), targeting knockdown of specific genes, hold enormous promise for precision-based therapeutics to treat numerous neurodegenerative disorders. However, whether shRNA constructed molecules can modify neuronal circuits underlying certain behaviors has not been explored. We designed shRNA to knockdown the human HTR2A gene in vitro using iPSC-differentiated neurons. Multi-electrode array (MEA) results showed that the knockdown of the 5HT-2A mRNA and receptor protein led to a decrease in spontaneous electrical activity. In vivo, intranasal delivery of AAV9 vectors containing shRNA resulted in a decrease in anxiety-like behavior in mice and a significant improvement in memory in both mice (104%) and rats (92%) compared to vehicle-treated animals. Our demonstration of a non-invasive shRNA delivery platform that can bypass the blood-brain barrier has broad implications for treating numerous neurological mental disorders. Specifically, targeting the HTR2A gene presents a novel therapeutic approach for treating chronic anxiety and age-related cognitive decline.",
