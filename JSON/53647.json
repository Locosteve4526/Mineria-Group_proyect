        "Description/Abstract": "During bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) differentiation, both Wnt signaling and the development of a rigid cytoskeleton promote commitment to the osteoblastic over adipogenic lineage. \u03b2-catenin plays a critical role in the Wnt signaling pathway to facilitate downstream effects on gene expression. We show that \u03b2-catenin was additive with cytoskeletal signals to prevent adipogenesis, and \u03b2-catenin knockdown promoted adipogenesis even when the actin cytoskeleton was depolymerized. \u03b2-catenin also prevented osteoblast commitment in a cytoskeletal-independent manner, with \u03b2-catenin knockdown enhancing lineage commitment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing demonstrated binding of \u03b2-catenin to the promoter of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a key component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) complex that catalyzes histone methylation. Knockdown of \u03b2-catenin reduced EZH2 protein levels and decreased methylated histone 3 (H3K27me3) at osteogenic loci. Further, when EZH2 was inhibited, \u03b2-catenin's anti-differentiation effects were lost. These results indicate that regulating EZH2 activity is key to \u03b2-catenin's effects on BMSCs to preserve multipotentiality. \u00a9 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",
