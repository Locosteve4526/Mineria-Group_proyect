        "Description/Abstract": "After publishing The Feminine Mystique, one of the best-selling books of the 1960s, Betty Friedan led a life of political action on behalf of feminism that led to a reformation of American laws and culture. She helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966, an organization that won notable legal and political victories for feminism. Friedan believed the future of civilization depended upon women choosing a new, career-focused way of life. Later in life, Friedan regretted how far her radical sisters took the principles of her Feminine Mystique. Yet despite later worries and qualifications, Friedan\u2019s initial ideas remained more influential than her change of heart.",
