        "Description/Abstract": "Purpose: This in-progress study attempts to determine if an associative relationship exists between the symptoms of procedural nausea and anxiety among breast cancer patients undergoing port access in an outpatient setting. There are multiple curative measure for both nausea and anxiety, including independent treatments specific to each symptom which may be more effective for one symptom but have little or no effect on the other (Davis, Hallerberg &amp; Palliative Medicine Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer, 2010). Therefore, a better understanding of the correlation between these symptoms could lead to more efficient and effective treatment of each.\n\nObjectives: To determine the frequency with which nausea and anxiety are experienced concurrently by breast cancer patients receiving PORT access in order to ascertain whether there exists an associative relationship between the two symptoms.\n",
