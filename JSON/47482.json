        "Description/Abstract": "Particularly in earlier stages of childhood, the relationship between a teacher, parent or guardian and a child is marked by a notable asymmetry: In taking care of children, the adult is \u201cthere\u201d for the child in a way that the child simply is not for the adult. This fundamental asymmetry is a key characteristic of the pedagogical relation articulated in the German pedagogical tradition as the basis for its account of pedagogy as a whole. Hermann Nohl, for example, described this relation as \u2018the unique (eigene) creative or generative relationship that binds educator and educand \u2026\u2019 and as a \u2018passionate\u2019 or \u2018loving relation between a mature person and one who is becoming, specifically for the sake of the latter, so that he comes to his life and form.\u2019 Nohl goes on to describe this relation as being \u2018sustained by two forces\u2019 which are seen slightly differently by adult and child: For the adult, these are \u2018love and authority,\u2019 and \u2018as perceived by the child,\u2019 they are \u2018love and allegiance (Gehorsam).\u2019\n\nThe tensions evident in a relation that would be at once \u2018passionate\u2019 or \u2018loving,\u2019 incorporating both authority and allegiance\u2014and existing only for the \u2018sake of\u2019 another\u2014highlight the problematic nature of the pedagogical relation. These include the fact that it involves not only the emergent autonomy and rationality manifest in the subjectivity of the child, but also the at best flawed autonomy, rationality and self-transparency of the adult. These problems are heightened by the fact that the child is not only vulnerable and dependent in such a relation, but that he or she generally is not in a position to decide either to enter into or exit from it. Family ties and professional obligations often have the effect of placing adults in a broadly comparable situation. In addition and perhaps paradoxically, such pedagogical relations can be said to form the basis on which subsequent expressions of equality, integrity and autonomy develop. Instead of constituting an ethos of asymmetry based on these virtues, the pedagogical relation suggests a rather different asymmetric dynamic. This is one founded much more on contact and dependency than communication or decision and is based on embodiment and pathos rather than rationality and autonomy. In the words of philosopher Bernhard Waldenfels, the child in these contexts represents not a broadly symmetrical \u201cother\u201d with qualities that we might also see in ourselves. Instead, he or she embodies aspects of the \u201calien,\u201d a radical form of alterity which, as Waldenfels says \u201cis visible only in its withdrawal.\u201d",
