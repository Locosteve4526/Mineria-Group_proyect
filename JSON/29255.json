        "Description/Abstract": "Protective clothing is most often used to provide safety and comfort for persons exposed to hot or cold environments. To assess the impact of clothing moisture and wetness on cooling, a series of wind-tunnel tests was conducted to quantify the evaporative cooling capacity of selected fabric samples. Single-layer cotton, polyester, nylon and silk were evaluated. The results showed that the onset and magnitude of evaporative cooling is determined by the amount of water contained in the fabric. The results also showed that the \u201cskin\u201d exhibited more cooling when covered with a fabric than when it was not. The information gained can assist in the selection of garment materials to optimize comfort and safety.",
