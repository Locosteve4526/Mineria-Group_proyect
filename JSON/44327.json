        "Description/Abstract": "Essay for Online Database: Many citizens believe that interest groups and lobbyists have too much influence on Congress (Gallup 2011, 2016). Is that an accurate belief? Do special interest groups and lobbyists have too much influence in Congress? The conflicting or mixed results of many political science studies on the impact of special interest groups and lobbyists in Congress suggest the answer to this question is no. This does not mean these actors have no influence on the process. Instead, the influence of special interest groups and lobbyists is more nuanced than commonly assumed. There are limitations on the influence of most special interest groups and lobbyists, including the challenges of getting on the agenda (Grossmann 2014). Moreover, special interest groups and lobbyists actually play an important role in policymaking through the provision of important information (Hall and Deardoff 2006; Wright 1996). In this essay, I discuss the key role special interests and lobbyists play in congressional policymaking and evaluate why they are not as powerful as commonly believed. ",
