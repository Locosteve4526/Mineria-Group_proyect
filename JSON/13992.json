        "Description/Abstract": "In this paper we introduce a family of theories of sets and classes\nmotivated by symmetry considerations, indexed by a natural number\nparameter.  For the smallest nontrivial value of the parameter we give\na consistency proof of the associated theory, and we show that the\nsets of this theory satisfy a fragment of NF not heretofore known to\nbe consistent, extending both the theory {\\em NF$_3$\\/} shown to be\nconsistent by Grishin (\\cite{grishin}) and the theory {\\em NFSI\\/}\nrecently shown to be consistent by Sergei Tupailo (\\cite{tupailo}).\nFor each larger value of the parameter we obtain a theory whose sets\nsatisfy {\\em NF\\/}, and whose comprehension axioms have a semantic\nrather than syntactical character.  We have published a paper on a\nsimilar but much more complicated extension of {\\em NF\\/} earlier\n(\\cite{symmetry}).",
