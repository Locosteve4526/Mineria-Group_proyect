        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In this installment of The Call of the Classroom, the authors suggest ways that graduate accountancy programs can remain viable as states reduce the educational requirements for CPA licensure. Specifically, they recommend that states follow the example set by Ohio in reforming their licensure laws and that faculty and other mentors help students see the benefits of earning a master\u2019s degree in accounting or taxation.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
