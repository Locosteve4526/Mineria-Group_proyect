        "Description/Abstract": "We examine the impact of disclosure by defendant firms on the outcome of securities fraud class actions. We hypothesize that firms issuing a higher quantity of disclosure will experience more adverse litigation outcomes, given the strict pleading standards of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). Using broad measures of disclosure derived from press releases issued during the class period, we find that more disclosure increases the likelihood that the judge will allow a lawsuit to proceed rather than dismissing it. Our results provide new insights to the literature on disclosure and litigation by studying the outcome rather than incidence of litigation, or the plaintiffs\u2019 decision to sue. We strengthen the inference that the features of the PSLRA create a positive relationship between overall disclosure and the likelihood of settlement by showing that the relationship holds when controlling for forward-looking disclosure and ex ante litigation risk, and by providing evidence that more public disclosures allow plaintiffs to present more extensive cases.",
