        "Description/Abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a debilitating movement disorder characterized by altered levels of ?6?2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) localized on presynaptic striatal catecholaminergic neurons.  ?-Conotoxin MII (?-CTx MII) is a highly useful ligand to probe ?6\u00df2 nAChRs structure and function, but it does not discriminate among closely related ?6* nAChR subtypes.  Modification of the ?-CTx MII primary sequence led to the identification of ?-CTx MII[E11A], an analog with 500-5300 fold discrimination between ?6* subtypes found in both human and non-human primates.  ?-CTx MII[E11A] binds most strongly (femtomolar dissociation constant) to the high affinity ?6* nAChR, a subtype that is selectively lost in Parkinson's disease.  Here we present the three-dimensional solution structure for ?-CTx MII[E11A] as determined by two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy to 0.13 +/- 0.09 ? backbone and 0.45 +/- 0.08 ? heavy atom root mean square deviation from mean structure.  Structural comparisons suggest that the increased hydrophobic area of ?-CTx MII[E11A] relative to other members of the ?-CTx family may be responsible for its exceptionally high affinity for ?6?4?2* nAChR as well as discrimination between ?6\u00df2 and ?3?2 containing nAChRs.  This finding may enable the rational design of novel peptide analogs that demonstrate enhanced specificity for ?6* nAChR subunit interfaces and provide a means to better understand nAChR structural determinants that modulate brain dopamine levels and the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.",
