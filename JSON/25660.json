According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in the latest year data are available (2005-2006), 88,134 students earned psychology bacalaureate degrees in the United States (Synder, Dillow, &amp; Hoffman, 2008). Given that &quot;degrees awarded&quot; represents only those who successfully complete a program, the overall number of psychology undergraduate majors is undoubtedly much higher.",
