        "Description/Abstract": "The importance of transcription factors in activating transcription is well appreciated, but the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo single-molecule imaging approaches, we directly correlated binding of the transcription factor Gal4 with the transcriptional bursting kinetics of the Gal4 target genes GAL3 and GAL10 in living yeast cells. We find that Gal4 dwell times sets the transcriptional burst size. Gal4 dwell time depends on the affinity of the binding site and is considerably reduced by promoter nucleosomes. Using a novel imaging platform, we simultaneously tracked transcription factor binding and transcription at one locus, revealing the timing and correlation between Gal4 binding and transcription. Collectively, our data support a model where multiple polymerases can initiate during a burst as long as the transcription factor is bound to DNA and a burst terminates when the transcription factor dissociates from the DNA.",
