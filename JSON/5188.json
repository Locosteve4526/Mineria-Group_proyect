        "Description/Abstract": "International collaboration in teaching and research has expanded as a result of the widespread accessibility and use of the World Wide Web. While on-line education has experienced the greatest growth, the use of remote laboratories in research and teaching is relatively new. The development of a remote ergonomics laboratory using a new Internet technology is described. The purpose of the remote laboratory is to provide international access to an advanced thermal manikin technology which provides a platform for measuring the thermodynamic properties of protective clothing during exposure to controlled environmental conditions. To date, the laboratory has generated global interest and promoted international collaboration in ergonomics teaching and research.",
