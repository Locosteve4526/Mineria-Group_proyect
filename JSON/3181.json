        "Description/Abstract": "This work reports on transition metal doped ZnO nanoparticles and  compares the effects doping with different transition metal ions has on  the structural, optical, and magnetic properties. Zn1?xMxO (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) nanoparticles were prepared by a chemical process for x = 0.02 and 0.05 in powder form. The powders where characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), spectrophotometry, and magnetometry. The Zn1?xMxO samples showed a strong correlation between changes in the lattice  parameters, bandgap energy, and the ferromagnetic saturation  magnetization. Unit cell volume and bandgap, determined from XRD and  spectrophotometry respectively, were maximized with Fe doping and  decreased as the atomic number of the dopant moved away from Fe. Bandgap  was generally lower at x = 0.05 than x = 0.02 for all dopants. The saturation magnetization reached a maximum of 6.38 memu/g for Zn0.95Fe0.05O.",
