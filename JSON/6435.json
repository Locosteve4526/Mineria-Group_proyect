        "Description/Abstract": "The article presents the author's experience regarding the effect of infusing drama into lessons in the middle schools of the United States. The author reflects on a role-play enacted by pairs of 8th graders. Being the teacher of the class the author monitored the drama and intervened on necessary occasions to shape an individual role-play. He did so in character as an immigration agency supervisor or messenger. He argues that the action strategies can work in any kind of unit in any subject area. It is a powerful medium for interaction and safe exploration of roles.",
