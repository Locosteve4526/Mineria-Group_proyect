        "Description/Abstract": "In an attempt to understand the nature of the oxide growth during corrosion in air of zirconium alloys, the structure and composition of the oxide film formed on Zircaloy alloys by corrosion reaction at high temperature in clean air were examined. It was indicated that tetragonal ZrO2 occurs at the temperature below its transitional temperature and the change of the oxidation kinetics and oxide morphology are caused by phase transformation in ZrO2. This study aims to characterize oxide structures and morphology including grain size, shape, phase, texture, cracks and precipitates using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The possibility to predicting oxidation behavior by studying the morphology and the structure of the oxide is evaluated and discussed including the influences of alloying composition. ",
