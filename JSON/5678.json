        "Description/Abstract": "Accurate classification systems based on evolution are imperative for  biological investigations. The recent explosion of molecular                      phylogenetics has resulted in a much improved  classification of angiosperms. More than five phylogenetic lineages have  been                      recognized from Scrophulariaceae sensu lato since  the family was determined to be polyphyletic; however, questions remain                      about the genera that have not been assigned to one  of the segregate families of Scrophulariaceae s.l. Rehmannia Liboschitz and Triaenophora Solereder are such genera with uncertain familial placement. There also is debate whether Triaenophora should be segregated from Rehmannia. To evaluate the phylogenetic relations between Rehmannia and Triaenophora, to find their closest relatives, and to verify their familial placement, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of the sequences                      of one nuclear DNA (ITS) region and four chloroplast DNA gene regions (trnL-F, rps16, rbcL, and rps2) individually and combined. The analyses showed that Rehmannia and Triaenophora are each strongly supported as monophyletic and together are sister to  Orobanchaceae. This relation was corroborated by phytochemical                      and morphological data. Based on these data, we  suggest that Rehmannia and Triaenophora represent the second nonparasitic branch sister to the remainder of Orobanchaceae (including Lindenbergia).",
