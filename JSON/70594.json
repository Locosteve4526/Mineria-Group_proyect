        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Understanding patterns of local adaptation, including adaptation driven by interactions with other species, is essential for predicting how populations will respond to global change. As a part of the SARE program, I conducted undergraduate research investigating evidence of local adaptation to soil microbial communities in Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush). Our results indicated that sagebrush seeds were more negatively impacted when translocated into \u201cforeign\u201d soil microbial communities; however, the strength of microbial interactions varied with environmental conditions. This research was strengthened by integrating methods across microbiology and plant ecology fields and collaborators across career stages, including undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty.&lt;/span&gt;",
