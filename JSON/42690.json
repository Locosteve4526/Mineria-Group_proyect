        "Description/Abstract": "Klaus Mollenhauer (1928-1998) is one of the most important German theorists of education of the postwar era. Mollenhauer is renowned for his contributions to critical pedagogy and educational social work (Soziap\u00e4dagogik) in Germany. His late philosophical work, Forgotten Connections: On Culture and Upbringing (2014) has been translated into multiple languages including English, and deals in a highly original and accessible way with education in its most basic human and cultural constituents. This chapter or entry begins with an overview of Mollenhauer\u2019s eventful life, and then discusses in greater depth the main phases of his thought: 1) an early phase of engagement with critical theory and praxis; and 2), a highly productive cultural and socio-historical phase, in which Mollenhauer developed the \u201canthropological ingredients for responsible education\u201d using an innovative method or \u201cscience\u201d of cultural examples. The chapter concludes with a discussion of Mollenhauer\u2019s national and international influence, and by addressing his life-long commitment to the fundamental themes of \u201chuman science pedagogy.\u201d",
