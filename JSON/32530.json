        "Description/Abstract": "There is a growing need for professionals who are able to analyze large data sets to inform business decisions. Evidence for this need is presented through examples of big data and analytics used to inform and assess informal and formal workplace learning initiatives, embed big data within a performance improvement (PI) framework, and deliver an emerging organizational readiness assessment tool are reviewed. If big data and analytics could address these needs, then the organizational readiness for this potential solution can be determined. Thus, the authors conclude by describing an emerging model of big data readiness in organizations and its implications for determining readiness. Recommendations for other future research are also provided. ",
