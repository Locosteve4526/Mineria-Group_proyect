        "Description/Abstract": "Lack of effective professional mentoring and minimal ongoing support programs have been\nsuggested as two primary contributors to the chronic shortages of special education teachers. Few\nprograms have been designed to address these specific causes. In this article we describe\nTATERS, a partnership between a university special educator preparation program, a state\nDepartment of Education, and district level administrations designed to (a) develop effective\nmentoring systems, and (b) strengthen training and recruitment of preservice and new special\neducation teachers, especially in rural areas.",
