        "Description/Abstract": "This paper presents a novel 2\u00d71D phase correlation based image registration method for verification of printer\nemulator output. The method combines the basic phase correlation technique and a modified 2x1D version of\nit to achieve both high speed and high accuracy. The proposed method has been implemented and tested using\nimages generated by printer emulators. Over 97% of the image pairs were registered correctly, accurately dealing\nwith diverse images with large translations and image cropping.",
