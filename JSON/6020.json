        "Description/Abstract": "We are reporting our results of Raman and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies on amorphous Ge46S54 thin films and the films after silver photodiffusion. Based on the  Raman scattering studies, a structural model for amorphous Ge46S54 is suggested including the formation of single Ge\u2013S chains with a vibrational mode at 410?cm?1.  The result of XRD measurement indicates that there exists a  medium-range order with about 6?\u0139\u00b4 even at such Ge-rich composition.  After the introduction of silver, the medium-range order is lost and  there was a change in the diffraction curve indicative of the change in  the local atomic order. The experimental results are explained in terms  of our structural model, in connection with the application for fast  switching memory devices.",
