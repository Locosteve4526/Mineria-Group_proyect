        "Description/Abstract": "This presentation examines the potential for Transnational New Governance (TNG) to fill the deficit of state action in the field of global sustainability.  Failure of state action in key areas has increased involvement of non-state actors (e.g., non-profit organizations that sponsor corporate codes of conduct) in global sustainability issues, using \u201cgovernance\u201d methods to coordinate action toward collective goals other than through traditional state power.   The paper uses orchestration theory, a form of TNG, as a tool to assess the potential of the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (UN SSEI) to foster global sustainability, in the absence of state action.",
