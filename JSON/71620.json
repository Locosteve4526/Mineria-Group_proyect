        "Description/Abstract": "Studies and regulations on vehicles have become more prominent as concerns continue to rise over mobile emissions. Most recognizable is the EPA Near-Road monitoring network that began in 2010. The focus of most air quality studies has been vehicular traffic on&lt;br&gt;freeways. Drive-through sales skyrocketed in 2020, accounting for 90% of restaurant revenue.5 The study presented here monitored traffic for a section of freeway (I-84) and local drive-through, the emissions of which were modeled using EPA MOVES. This resulted in\u00a0peak PM10 (25.0 g/hr freeway versus 1.83 g/hr drive through) and PM2.5 (10.7 g/hr freeway versus 1.22 g/hr) loading rates. Loading rates were assigned to 67 drive-throughs over a 32-square mile study area and applied to the freeway. All emission points were given a\u00a0500-foot radius for particulate matter extent and overlaid with 2020 census data. An estimated 58,189 people experience particulate matter exposure in their homes, the majority of which (37,872 or 65.1%) results from their proximity to drive-throughs. The aggregate\u00a0influence of drive-throughs affects nearly twice as many people compared to a freeway despite their relatively minute individual emissions. This warrants additional monitoring and potential regulatory consideration.",
