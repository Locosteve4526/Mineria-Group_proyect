        "Description/Abstract": "In 2011, I embarked on a project to incorporate mobile technology into the freshman aural skills class in hopes of bridging the gap between work students did in and out of class. Before receiving iPads, I observed students struggling to find the time and space to practice the skills learned in class; practice rooms were often full and pianos out of tune making it difficult to practice for ear training class. Having a mobile device, such as an iPad, has allowed students easier access to exercises and homework modules through the use of targeted low cost applications, document sharing sites, and virtual keyboards",
