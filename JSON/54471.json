        "Description/Abstract": "Due to pandemic restrictions for in-person learning, simulation faculty had the opportunity to find creative solutions for meeting student learning objectives for clinical courses in an online environment. One solution was to prerecord simulation scenarios in the simulation lab using faculty in simulation participant roles. Prerecorded simulations were used by faculty in different ways. Prerecorded simulations were shown to students synchronously in the classroom or over Zoom\u2122 meetings or asynchronously as a course video. Simulations were debriefed by faculty or a structured worksheet. An unanticipated result of utilizing multiple simulation delivery options was that methods are able to be compared and evaluated against each other for future use. While we are looking forward to the end of the pandemic, evaluating remote simulation delivery options are could be useful in the future for meeting the educational or professional development needs of remote learners in the future. Being able to compare, test, and revise simulation options will help create opportunities to effectively reach future learners. \nKeywords: Clinical reasoning, simulation, nursing education\n\n",
