        "Description/Abstract": "The proliferation of short-term rentals (STRs) like those offered on Airbnb is transforming neighborhoods in cities around the world. In many places, properties that were once occupied by homeowners or long-term renters are becoming de-facto hotel rooms. An emerging literature takes up the broad implications of this shift, from pressures on housing affordability to impacts on the hospitality industry. Other scholars have begun examining how the increasing presence of STR \u201cguests\u201d (the term used by Airbnb, the largest operator of STRs globally), and the changing uses of dwellings, is altering the experiences of neighborhood and neighboring. Following a discussion of neighboring as a multidimensional concept reflecting practices, knowledge, and relationships, this paper summarizes and synthesizes the emerging scholarship on short-term rentals, organizing the work in five thematic areas: challenges to neighborhoods\u2019 knowability; diminishment of neighborly interactions; impacts on social control and order; the specific implications of STRs for housing tenure; and potential impacts on neighborhood organizing. Conclusions include a research agenda suggested by what we do and do not know about the implications of this new land use.",
