        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;As next generation technologies aim to advance the fields of energy, space exploration, and environmental safety, it is imperative to develop and improve techniques for thermal properties analysis within these extreme environments. Devising measurement schematics for thermal property determination can be difficult due to high temperatures, neutron flux, and electromagnetic radiation, in addition to limited working spaces that frequently accompany these systems. Thermal properties can undergo significant changes in harsh conditions, rendering the full spectra of thermal properties often unattainable with current measurement approaches. Recently, there has been an increased focus on developing improvements for such systems to accurately determine thermal properties that will increase efficiencies, reduce costs, and resolve ongoing problems. In-pile measurement capabilities are paramount for the continued development of nuclear technology. Various needle probe techniques, resistance thermometers, thermocouples, ultrasonic thermometry, fiber optics, and novel Raman techniques have been proposed for use in-pile. The development of compact and robust systems for use on spacecraft and in deep sea/earth drilling operations it crucial for improving safety and efficiencies. Resistance and acoustic thermometers are of interest for deep sea/earth drilling while sensors small enough to fit on compact chips are suggested for space applications. Various methods have been constructed to account for these highly complex systems, each with promising benefits for their respective applications.&lt;/p&gt;",
