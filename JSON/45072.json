        "Description/Abstract": "Deception detection is an unfortunate necessity in group work. Guarding against team member\u2019s alternative agendas is difficult, and may seem even more difficult in technology-driven business environments that have made multitasking during team work increasingly commonplace. This research develops a foundation for a nuanced understanding of deception detection under these conditions. The intersection of information technology multitasking and deception detection theories are shown to produce various and sometimes competing ideas as to how this type of multitasking might affect truthfulness assessments in real-time team work. A laboratory study was conducted with 129 participants in which a collaborative game was used with manipulated deception and multitasking behaviors in a real-time, virtual group collaboration environment. The results provide evidence that information multitasking can actually improve truthfulness assessments, likely because multitaskers engage less in the team conversation, making themselves less manipulable.
