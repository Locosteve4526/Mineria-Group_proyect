        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\u2014Sense of community and belonging represent key\ncomponents of students' success in undergraduate degree\nprograms. As part of a curriculum effort designed to strengthen\nthese components, we conducted a Social Network Analysis of\nstudents in an undergraduate computer science program to\nestablish a baseline measurement of students' connectedness in\nthe program. Analysis of these data showed no significant\ndifferences in connectedness between male and female students\nor white and non-white students. The analysis did identify\nsignificant differences based on students' class year, interest and\nparticipation in computer games, and being employed by the\ncomputer science department.",
