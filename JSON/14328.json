        "Description/Abstract": " We have analyzed thunder from over 200\nlightning flashes to determine which part of thunder comes\nfrom the gas dynamic expansion of portions of the rapidly\nheated lightning channel and which from electrostatic field\nchanges. Thunder signals were recorded by a ~1500 m\nnetwork of 3 to 4 4-element microphone deployed in the\nMagdalena mountains of New Mexico in the summers of 2011\nand 2012. The higher frequency infra-sound and audio-range\nportion of thunder is thought to come from the gas dynamic\nexpansion, and the electrostatic mechanism gives rise to a\nsignature infra-sound pulse peaked at a few Hz. More than 50\nsignature infra-sound pulses were observed in different portions\nof the thunder signal, with no preference towards the beginning\nor the end of the signal. Detection of the signature pulse occurs\nsometimes only for one array and sometimes for several arrays,\nwhich agrees with the theory that the pulse is highly directional\n(i.e., the recordings have to be in a specific position with respect\nto the cloud generating the pulse to be able to detect it). The\ndetection of these pulses under quiet wind conditions by different\nacoustic arrays corroborates the electrostatic mechanism originally\nproposed by Wilson [1920], further studied by Dessler [1973] and\nFew [1985], observed by Bohannon [1983] and Balachandran [1979,\n1983], and recently analyzed by Pasko [2009]. Pasko employed a\nmodel to explain the electrostatic-to-acoustic energy conversion and\nthe initial compression waves in observed infrasonic pulses, which\nagrees with the observations we have made. We present thunder\nsamples that exhibit signature infra-sound pulses at different times\nand acoustic source reconstruction to demonstrate the beaming effect.",
