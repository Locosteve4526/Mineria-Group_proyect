        "Description/Abstract": "The American Association for Health Education (AAHE), a national health education organization with the mission of advancing the profession of health education, launched the 2011 AAHE membership survey between October 13, 2011 and November 1, 2011, under the leadership of the AAHE Board of Directors and AAHE Staff.  The primary objective of the survey was to provide insight into the perspectives of AAHE members on several important issues facing the organization: including, AAHE exiting its parent organization, the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AAHPERD), and the proposed \u201cmodified\u201d merger with the Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE), another national health education organization.  A total of 240 AAHE members completed the survey.  A majority of respondents were university faculty members in health education, and results provide keen insight into AAHE members\u2019 perspectives on the AAHE-SOPHE modified merger. ",
