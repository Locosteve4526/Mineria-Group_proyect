        "Description/Abstract": "Texts are a large part of most universities C02 footprint. Our analysis shows that the emissions from conventional texts and e-texts do not differ substantially under many circumstances, even though e-texts are often thought of as environmentally preferable. Reducing emissions associated with both types of texts is important for univs seeking to reduce their CO2 footprint. We provide recommendations for reducing text-related emissions based on three key drivers identified in our analysis.",
