        "Description/Abstract": "This response paper begins by countering the contributions of Don Ihde and Robert Rosenberger to this special issue, making its case in existential terms. Then, addressing Darin Barney, these arguments are developed further in aesthetic terms, making use of the \u201cmodernist\u201d educational theory of Ren\u00e9 Arcilla. This response article concludes by returning to the realm of the educational with the help of Albert Borgmann's and Estrid S\u0159rensen's feedback.",
