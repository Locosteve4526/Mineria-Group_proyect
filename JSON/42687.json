        "Description/Abstract": "I wish to elaborate on what I see as the two pivotal affirmations in Hodgson, Vlieghe and Zamojski five principles for a \u201cPost-Critical Pedagogy.\u201d: An affirmation of a \u201cpedagogical hermeneutics\u201d and of a passionate hope in and for the world. I discuss the ontological, existential roots of these principles, referencing the existentialist hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer, and an account of pedagogical hermeneutics from Helmut Danner. I begin, however, with a 1983 \u201cmodern classic\u201d in pedagogy, Forgotten Connections: On Culture and Upbringing (translated in 2014 by the author of this response) written by Klaus Mollenhauer, whose ideas, I believe, are closely linked if not indispensable to those of the manifesto.",
