        "Description/Abstract": "The electroceramics industry largely relies on various time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error experiments to address new questions which often could otherwise be interpolated from published data. Towards this end, predictive models, which can be derived from empirical evidence, can greatly aid the direction of future development in a meaningful and cost-effective way. This work focuses on deriving predictive models based on empirical data collected for ceramic compounds with the perovskite crystal structure. Theory suggests that intrinsic properties on the scale of a unit cell may be estimated from the sizes and charges of the chemical constituents alone.  Ultimately, researchers could be provided a compositional recipe for some desired structure/property; or the resulting structure/property could be readily calculated based on composition.  Empirical models also lend themselves to the exploration of structure/property trends which would otherwise be virtually impossible to discover via computationally expensive first-principles methods. In this work, models were made for layered ordering in the [(NayLi1-y)(1-3x)/2La(1+x)/2]TiO3 (NLLT) system and rocksalt ordering in Ba(Mg\u2153Ta\u2154)O3 (BMT).",
