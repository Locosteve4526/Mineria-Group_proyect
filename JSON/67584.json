        "Description/Abstract": "Grant writing is an important skill to develop, allowing students to envision solutions to issues that impact their local, regional, and global communities. Additionally, grant writing, like other research-associated activities, can improve student success in and out of the classroom. Grant writing can help students understand the alignment between research activities and a &quot;big picture&quot; understanding of the common good and societal impact of the research. Grant writing can improve students' ability to articulate the significance and broader impacts of research. Faculty mentors can play a major role in grant writing activities by helping to guide undergraduate students through the process. A course-based approach can help instructors who mentor students in research by providing scaffolding and scheduling tools. This article provides an overview of a grant writing course used as an efficient and effective way for undergraduate students to be guided through the grant proposal writing process with a greater potential for positive outcomes. We discuss why undergraduate students should learn how to write grant proposals, the advantages of teaching grant writing in a course-based format, time management, learning outcomes, and ways to assess student learning. \u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",
