        "Description/Abstract": "I analyzed 3 introductory statistics textbooks to generate a listing of key terms and concepts. After removing duplications, 374 unique terms formed the master list. A national sample of introductory statistics instructors (N = 190) evaluated portions of the master list, rating each item on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 3 (extremely important). I list the Top 100 items and offer recommendations about the usefulness of the importance listing in facilitating statistics instruction.",
