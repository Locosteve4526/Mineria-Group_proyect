        "Description/Abstract": "Increased community diversity can increase productivity and stability of algal cultures, a phenomenon that could enhance economics of wastewater-based mass algal cultivation. Our study represents the first systematically designed assessment of algal diversity effects in dairy wastewater. We employed 28 species combinations across four species richness levels to identify effects of diversity on biomass yield and resistance to grazing by rotifers; trait-based modeling was then used to determine algal traits that most affected grazing resistance. On average, greater species richness increased yield (up to 41%) and grazing resistance index (up to 140%) relative to monocultures. In our selected model (R2=0.56), grazing resistance increased with increasing cell size (p&lt;0.0001) and variation in cell size (p&lt;0.0001), and decreased with increasing C:N ratio (p=0.05) and carbohydrate content (p=0.01). These results may help inform polyculture selection strategies and provide insight into how ecologically-informed engineering approaches could further optimize the productivity and stability of wastewater-based algal cultivation.",
