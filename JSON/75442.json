        "Description/Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disease marked by a host immune reaction that targets and destroys the neuronal myelin sheath. MS and correlating animal disease models show comorbidities, including intestinal barrier disruption and alterations of the commensal microbiome. It is accepted that diet plays a crucial role in shaping the microbiota composition and overall gastrointestinal (GI) tract health, suggesting an interplay between nutrition and neuroinflammation via the gut-brain axis. Unfortunately, poor host health and diet lead to microbiota modifications that could lead to significant responses in the host, including inflammation and neurobehavioral changes. Beneficial microbial metabolites are essential for host homeostasis and inflammation control. This review will highlight the importance of the gut microbiota in the context of host inflammatory responses in MS and MS animal models. Additionally, microbial community restoration and how it affects MS and GI barrier integrity will be discussed.",
