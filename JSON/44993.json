        "Description/Abstract": "In 2001, Lewis R. Binford developed a database of hunter-gatherer societies that allows researchers to make projections useful study offor major cultural and evolutionary transitions. This unique database, used only in one other university in the country, is ideal for student application to case-based research design. The target courses are ANTH 312 and ANTH 400. \r\nThe database currently uses a format that is not well-suited to undergraduate student use. This paper discusses the incorporation of the database into the two classes with the assistance of an undergraduate peer mentor, and results of evaluated using student research project performance, reflection about the use of case studies, and development of class results in professional presentations.\r\n",
