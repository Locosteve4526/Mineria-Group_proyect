        "Description/Abstract": "Over the years, American feathered objects were exported to Europe for adorning hats, dresses, military helmets, tourney and procession horses; Birds of Paradise were carried by kings into battle; feathers were collected in curiosity cabinets, headdresses were used in theatrical productions, Mexican feather paintings decorated aristocratic walls, and Catholic bishops in Europe wore Indigenous-made feather miters. Feathers from the New World were one of the many American objects to change the Old World. ",
