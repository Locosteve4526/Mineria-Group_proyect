        "Description/Abstract": "Anna Stanis\u0142awska wrote an autobiography describing forced marriage to a mentally ill man who terrorized her, but she managed escape.  The case was so extraordinary that Jan Andzrej Morsztyn wrote, \u201cA Maid, for she knows no husband, and yet a wife,/For he lives, he to whom she was married.\u201d\nStanis\u0142awska might have accepted her fate, but instead she used the system of law, patronage, and family connections to escape.  She describes the strategies to extricate herself, and concludes with the most damning pieces of evidence against the transacting in women.  \nShe wins a divorce, though not without loss.  Her account reveals a woman of character from a distant time but whose desire for liberty and self-determination is eternal.\n",
