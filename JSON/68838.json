        "Description/Abstract": "Jared L Talley was born and raised in rural Idaho and now seeks to help these communities adapt and thrive in a changing world. He is an Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies in Boise State University\u2019s School of Public Service and a policy consultant for the Idaho Governor\u2019s Office of Species Conservation. An environmental philosopher by training and an interdisciplinary scholar in practice, his work seeks to better understand how communities relate to the land and how this poses obstacles and opportunities for collaboration and governance. Particularly, he studies the role of science in collaborative policy, the role of place in environmental identity, and the role of the imagination in mediating both.",
