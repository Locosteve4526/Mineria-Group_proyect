        "Description/Abstract": "Methyl bromide (MeBr) is a sterilizing fumigant used to control quarantine pests that is restricted due to its detrimental atmospheric effects. The degradation of injected MeBr produces crop-available Br . Up to five applications of MeBr were used in southeastern Idaho fields to combat the pale cyst nematode (Globodera pallida). Data regarding the uptake and partitioning of Br in crops following MeBr application in the region were unavailable. Research determined background concentrations of Br in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), corn (Zea mays L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) compared to MeBr-treated fields. Background Br concentrations ranged from nondetectable (ND) to 33.0\u00a0mg Br kg ; vegetative tissue concentrations were greater than reproductive, except corn where there was no difference. Nearly all crops grown in MeBr-treated fields had greater Br concentrations than background. Background-baled-alfalfa tissue Br concentration was 33.0\u00a0mg kg compared to 117.8\u00a0mg Br kg from a MeBr-treated field. Br concentration in green alfalfa decreased from 79.8 to 36.5\u00a0mg Br kg at the final cutting in a MeBr-treated field, where time after application decreased crop Br concentrations. Small grains had low Br concentrations in reproductive tissue (1.7\u00a0mg Br kg ) compared to vegetative tissue (106.5\u00a0mg Br kg ). Corn stover concentration (12.7\u00a0mg Br kg ) was low relative to small-grain straw, but corn ear (5.8\u00a0mg Br kg ) was greater than small-grain reproductive tissue in the MeBr-treated field. Crop selection following MeBr applications should consider the likelihood of elevated Br concentration for the plant fractions intended end use.",
