        "Description/Abstract": "The ability to couple problem solving both to the understanding of  chemical concepts and to laboratory practices is an essential skill for  undergraduate chemistry programs to foster in our students. Therefore,  chemistry programs must offer opportunities to answer real problems that  require use of problem-solving processes used by practicing chemists,  including those of experimental design. Additionally, programs should  assess the extent to which these skills are mastered by students and use  the results to inform curricular development. This manuscript describes  a rubric for experimental problem solving in chemistry that seeks to  assess the extent to which students can both understand a chemical  problem and design an instrument-based strategy to address it. The  rubric effectively differentiates responses to practicum questions  answered by students at different stages of the undergraduate chemistry  curriculum. The data show that students improve in their ability to  problem solve as they progress through the program. On average, students  are able to provide a &quot;correct&quot; answer before they are able to  articulate a complete understanding of the problem or to justify their  choices. The rubric will be useful to others seeking to study or assess  student problem-solving skills at both the course and curricular levels.",
