        "Description/Abstract": "Involving students in primary research enhances education \u2013 increasing student interest, retention, grades, and graduation rates. Likewise, students can provide invaluable assistance to cutting edge research. Initiated and run by Dr. Arthur Scarritt and Dr. Sergio Romero, the Inter-Mountain Social Research Lab (IMSRL) of the Department of Sociology addresses pressing issues in the discipline and the Boise community through bringing research and teaching together. In a yearlong intensive research training program, faculty guide a small group of undergraduate students through developing and executing all aspects of an original research project, from inception to dissemination. Spring semester incorporates the project into an upper division class, with the research students mentoring their peers through different aspects of the project. Students and faculty present their findings at a regional conference, at Boise State, at community venues, and through peer-reviewed articles. \r\nRole:  Principal",
