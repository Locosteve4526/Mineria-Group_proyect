        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;A debate among immigration theorists\u2019 centers around the roles/influence of immigrants and/or aspects of the host society in shaping immigrants\u2019 assimilation. Conceptualizing the \u201clocus of control\u201d in shaping immigrants\u2019 assimilation is both complex and nuanced. Immigrants must negotiate dimensions of &lt;em&gt;cultural membership &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;symbolic belonging. &lt;/em&gt;This research centers on addressing the (perceived) \u201clocus of control\u201d by asking - with whom does the locus of control lie in immigrants \u201cfitting in\u201d in US society? I draw on 94 in-depth interviews of native-born Americans to understand how members of the host society view the \u201clocus of control\u201d in immigrants\u2019 assimilation into US society. I find consensus regarding some degree of cultural adaptation as required of immigrants, especially skills and use of English. However, race and racism are overwhelmingly perceived as obstacles to immigrants\u2019 assimilation, disadvantaging immigrants of color. Interestingly, respondents\u2019 subjective histories and immigration experience influence ideas around the \u201clocus of control\u201d in immigrants\u2019 assimilation into US society. Two important implications emerge. First, the assimilation process is not perceived to be race-neutral among many native-born Americans. Second, it &lt;em&gt;cultural membership &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;symbolic belonging &lt;/em&gt;in the US are not merely the products of an &lt;em&gt;imagined community, &lt;/em&gt;but the outcome of &lt;em&gt;experiential phenomena.&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;",
