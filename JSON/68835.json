        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;To say that our contemporary society faces a multitude of wicked problems is as much a diagnosis of our reality as it is a vacuous platitude. In an age of civil unrest and economic injustice \u2013 all backgrounded by climate change \u2013 it may be that all of the problems we face are wicked. It is at least plausible that the issues we researchers engage in are most often those sorts characterized as wicked.&lt;/p&gt;\nWickedness begets ontological, epistemic, and ethical divergences that provide opportunity for the public scholar to engage. In this workshop, participants will both learn about wicked problems &lt;em&gt;qua &lt;/em&gt;wicked problems and develop strategies to use the framing of wicked problems as a facilitative tool to help concerned publics navigate the problems they face. Grappling with the complexities of wicked problems is itself a discursive tool that can help the public articulate assumed values, frame problems, and define solution sets that help coordinate social action.",
