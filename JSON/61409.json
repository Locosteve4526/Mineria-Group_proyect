        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose \u2013 Literature review articles have become a frequently applied research approach in operations and\nsupply chain management (SCM). The purpose of this paper aims to elaborate on four approaches for\ndeveloping or employing theory in systematic literature reviews (SLRs).\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 The paper uses conceptual arguments and illustrates them by pointing to\nrecent examples. In SLRs, the material collection is usually based on keywords and searching databases, which\nis comparatively well documented. Data analysis, however, often falls short in documentation and,\nconsequently, is neither well explained nor replicable. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the elaboration of the\ndata analysis and sense-making stage in the research process of SLRs.\nFindings \u2013 The paper presents four different approaches, which are characterized as theory (1) building,\n(2) modification, (3) refinement and (4) extension, based on whether new concepts are formed or extant concepts\nwithin SCM or other fields of management theory are adopted.\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 The limitation of this research is that literature reviews could be\nconducted and presented in many ways. Since the focus of this research is on systematic literature reviews, only\na limited number of approaches can be discussed and presented here.\nOriginality/value \u2013 The paper contributes to explaining the process and expected outcomes of a literature\nreview and, therefore, aids in further developing the related methodological approaches. This is relevant as\nliterature review publications now often replace conceptual or theoretical pieces but still have to deliver\nconcerning demands of theory building.\nKeywords Supply chain management, Systematic literature review, Theory development, Research process\nPaper type Research Paper\n",
