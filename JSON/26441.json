        "Description/Abstract": "This book presents an innovative and unique way of combining pedagogy, research, and documentary making. This book is grounded in the authentic experience of educators, with award winning filmmaker Fabio Caramaschi, who have done and continue to do the work of in-the-field research. The authors expand the definition of \u2018field research\u2019 by engaging the students in documentary filmmaking while researching an underrepresented local community. This book details how to create a course that is genuinely collaborative and respectful of students and community members. A syllabus and a step by step schedule of how to conduct the research along with a list of documentary movies are provided. The ideas presented should encourage educators to create similar experiences in their communities.",
