        "Description/Abstract": "Human Science Pedagogy is \u201ca strange case,\u201d as J\u00fcrgen Oelkers has recently noted: In the Anglophone world, it highlights pedagogically- and experientially-familiar themes such as the pedagogical relation and pedagogical tact, but it places them in a rather unfamiliar theoretical and historical context. For Germans, particularly in more \u201cgeneral\u201d or philosophical areas of educational scholarship, it can be said to combine historical dominance with contemporary disavowal. Its ongoing influence is still widely evident but simultaneously, widely ignored. Taking this strange case as its frame, this paper introduces Human Science Pedagogy to English-language readers, providing a cursory overview of its history, while highlighting the relevance of its themes and methods in both English- and German-speaking scholarship today. In so doing, it seeks to shed light on the current \u201cstrange\u201d contemporary circumstances of Human Science Pedagogy in both Germany and the Anglophone world today. This paper concludes with an appeal to readers from both sides of the Atlantic to new or renewed consideration of this pedagogy as a significant and influential source for educational thinking that deserves recognition as such in both German and English.",
