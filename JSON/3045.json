        "Description/Abstract": "Executives within many mainline denominations, such as the United  Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, were frustrated by  their inability to inspire widespread debate and action at the  congregational level about the Vietnam War Using the UPCUSA as a case  study, this article argues that parish clergy functioned as the primary  bottlenecks between the denominations and the congregations,  constricting the flow of information largely because of their  uncomfortable, precarious, middle position between liberal leadership  and more conservative laity. By ming clergy journals and citing pastors  in their own words, this essay illustrates the ambivalence local  ministers felt toward both laity and church executives, as well as their  concerns and confusion, as they struggled to navigate the clergy-laity  divide during a highly polarized time.",
