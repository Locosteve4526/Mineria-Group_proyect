        "Description/Abstract": "Patients who have total knee arthroplasty (TKA) likely suffer from decreased postural stability because of postoperative changes in musculoskeletal structure and loss of proprioception. The purpose of this experimental biomechanical study was to determine if patients who have TKA improve their dynamic postural control during walking after TKA as compared with before TKA. The secondary purpose was to assess changes in postural control between post-TKA patients and healthy controls.",
