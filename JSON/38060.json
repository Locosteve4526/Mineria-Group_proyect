        "Description/Abstract": "The book Weird Westerns: Race, Gender, Genre (University of Nebraska Press Postwestern Horizon series) asks how categories of identity become malleable or horrific when western spaces and conventions meet the \u201cweird\u201d genres of speculative, gothic, and horror fiction. This chapter traces the critical development of weird westerns back to the nineteenth century. Although the writer Bret Harte is often credited with *originating* many conventions of the popular western (against which weird westerns later reacted), this essay provides historical and generic contexts to place him more accurately as a hybrid *adaptor* of earlier genres who challenged the conventions of gender, race, and manifest destiny already associated with the western genre by the 1860s. Harte's gothic western hybrids invert the heroism of white western pioneer historiography, so that &quot;pure&quot; racial and familial claims to western space are not heroic or providential but monstrous.
