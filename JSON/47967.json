        "Description/Abstract": "This case history describes several different impacts to infrastructure from, and geotechnical related consequences of,\nHurricane Irma, active 9-10 September 2017 in north and central Florida (FL). A team of geotechnical and coastal engineers\nwas deployed by the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association. The team collaborated with federal,\nstate, and local organizations to identify sites damaged by the hurricane's intense rainfall, flooding, waves, and storm surge.\nThe team then deployed to these sites from 25-27 September 2017 before local and state agencies commenced or finalized repairs. The team cataloged geotechnical damage to infrastructure, including sinkhole damage to residential structures and roadways; storm drain capacity exceedance; storm surge and wave-induced erosion of retaining walls; bridge embankments; and a small dam failure. The hope is that information collected and described herein and by Hudyma et al. (2017) will provide guidance for future reconnaissance efforts as well as planning, design, construction, repair, and risk assessment for infrastructure in hurricane prone areas.",
