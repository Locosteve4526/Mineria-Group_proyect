By facing the Whole, it is the curatorial concept to create the unity of an image through the diversity of artistic concepts, symbolizing the natural diversity, as well as the diversity of aspects forming finally the fundament of what is called \u201cthe climate\u201d. But artists are neither scientists or politicians, therefore they do not offer solutions for a complex matter, which only slowly is recognized as such by the majority of people. What artists can do is reflecting, and by stimulating &amp; encouraging, changing, in the best case, awareness by sensitizing the viewer or listener through the art work. Based on such an awareness itself, additionally each artistic contribution is representing a piece of solidarity to those who suffer from climate change.",
