        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: Previous research has shown that female physicians in rural areas need strong support networks to maintain a healthy work-life balance. We sought to better understand the types of support they need and how they find it, as well as how their needs change over time.\nMethods: Two groups of physicians from the same family rural practice residency were interviewed over a five-month period using a semi-structured format. Group One (n=10) included those who had graduated within the last five years. Group Two (n=10) included those who had completed their residency six or more years ago. Interviews were transcribed and then analyzed and coded independently by three members of the research team. Emergent\nthemes and subthemes were discussed by the full research team.\nResults: The twenty participants, ten in each group, discussed in detail the types of support they relied on and the continuing challenges of maintaining a healthy work-life interface. They focused particularly on the need to select carefully one\u2019s life partner and practice partners and the difficulties in setting up practice in an area without family, friends or professional mentors nearby. Although forming boundaries was important, so was developing close relationships with patients and their families. This was the one factor that made rural practice both satisfying and sustainable.\nConclusions: Rural female physicians think of their work in relational terms, and it involves a great deal of emotional labor. Support systems mitigate the psychological effects of this labor and help physicians develop resilience in managing both work and life. Educators can better prepare female physicians by discussing the costs and benefits of emotional labor and the necessity of support networks to help sustain a rural practice, as well as how to negotiate a contract that is consistent with a physician\u2019s values, practice style and family life.",
