        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;color:#001e42;font-size:15px;font-style:normal;background-color:#f2f5fa;&quot;&gt;The most commonly used method to measure blood pressure in adults is middle upper arm sphygmomanomtery. However, different cuff-sizes can result in different pressure readings. Pressure readings will be higher for larger arm circumferences and lower for smaller arm circumferences when the same cuff is used. The goal of this study was to determine an adjustment factor that will allow measurements obtained for any combination of arm circumference and cuff size to be compared to each other. The results of this study showed that the percentage (%) value of upper arm circumference coverge by the cuff can serve as such an adjustment factor. Data obtained from nineteen test subjects showed that a 1% change in upper arm coverage results in a 1\u00a0mmHg change in both systolic and diastolic pressure readings. Using the proposed % adjustment factor allows a patient\u2019s blood pressure to be compared to blood pressure values obtained using any combination of cuff bladder size and arm circumference. This will also allow pressure readings to be matched to the American Heart Association\u2019s recommended upper arm coverage of 80%.&lt;/span&gt;",
