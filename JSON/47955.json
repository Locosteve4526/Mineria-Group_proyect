        "Description/Abstract": "As designers and managers for society\u2019s infrastructure, civil engineers, including the geotechnical community, must understand and predict the most severe expected loadings from physical or environmental events and how their designs will respond to those loadings. Geotechnical engineers have used a variety of methods to gain this understanding \u2014 analytical evaluation, laboratory tests, field mock-ups \u2014 but our most memorable lessons have come from observation of failures and successes after severe loading events. The Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance Association (GEER) endeavors to advance understanding of severe loadings by deploying teams of engineers from academia and professional practice to &quot;collect perishable, post-disaster data that can be useful in advancing our understanding of extreme events,&quot; such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes/typhoons, storms, landslides, tsunamis, and wildfires. The GEER missions are made possible by funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF).",
