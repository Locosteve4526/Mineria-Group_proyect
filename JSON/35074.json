        "Description/Abstract": "The relationship between marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and bone health is poorly understood. We used running exercise to ask whether obesity-associated MAT can be attenuated via exercise and whether this correlates with gains in bone quantity and quality. C57BL/6 mice were divided into diet-induced obesity (DIO, n\u2009=\u200914) versus low-fat diet (LFD, n\u2009=\u200914). After 3 months, 16-week-old mice were allocated to an exercise intervention (LFD-E, DIO-E) or a control group (LFD, DIO) for 6 weeks (4 groups, n\u2009=\u20097/group). Marrow adipocyte area was 44% higher with obesity (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001) and after exercise 33% lower in LFD (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001) and 39% lower in DIO (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001). In LFD, exercise did not affect adipocyte number; however, in DIO, the adipocyte number was 56% lower (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001). MAT was 44% higher in DIO measured by osmium-\u03bcCT, whereas exercise associated with reduced MAT (-23% in LFD, -48% in DIO, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). MAT was additionally quantified by 9.4TMRI, and correlated with osmium-\u00b5CT (r\u2009=\u20090.645; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01). Consistent with higher lipid beta oxidation, perilipin 3 (PLIN3) rose with exercise in tibial mRNA (+92% in LFD, +60% in DIO, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Tibial \u00b5CT-derived trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) was not influenced by DIO but responded to exercise with an increase of 19% (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). DIO was associated with higher cortical periosteal and endosteal volumes of 15% (p\u2009=\u20090.012) and 35% (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01), respectively, but Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar was lower by 2.4% (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). There was a trend for higher stiffness (N/m) in DIO, and exercise augmented this further. In conclusion, obesity associated with increases in marrow lipid-measured by osmium-\u03bcCT and MRI-and partially due to an increase in adipocyte size, suggesting increased lipid uptake into preexisting adipocytes. Exercise associated with smaller adipocytes and less bone lipid, likely invoking increased \u00df-oxidation and basal lipolysis as evidenced by higher levels of PLIN3. \u00a9 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",
