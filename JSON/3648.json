        "Description/Abstract": "Volcan Santiaguito in Guatemala \u2018breathes\u2019 with an extraordinary regularity inasmuch as the edifice\u2019s conduit system accumulates a free gas volume, which periodically vents to the atmosphere.  This periodic pressurization controls the timing of explosive events, which nearly always occur at peak inflation, as detected with short baseline tiltmeters.  The tilt cycles observed in January 2012 reveal striking 26 +/-6 min cycles of inflation and deflation corresponding to at least 104 kg of gas fluxing the system each cycle (~101 kg/s).  Very long period (VLP) earthquakes presage explosions and occur during those tilt cycles for which inflation rates are most rapid.  These VLPs locate ~300 m below the vent and indicate initial mobilization of volatiles, which ascend at about 50 m/s.  Rapid ascent feeds pyroclast-laden explosive eruptions lasting up to several minutes and rising more than one kilometer.  VLPs are not typically observed during less rapid inflation episodes; instead, gas vents passively through the conduit producing no infrasound and no explosion.  These observations intimate that steady gas exsolution and accumulation in a shallow reservoir drives inflation cycles at open-vent silicic volcano. ",
