        "Description/Abstract": "Most elements contain isotopes. In particular, for nuclear materials, it\u2019s common to see both stable and unstable isotopes after the material experienced irradiation. Based on mass spectrometry, atom probe tomography is a unique and powerful technique to characterize isotopes of each element. The three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP), CAMECA LEAP 4000X HR, at Microscopy and Characterization Suite (MaCS), Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES), is such a tool to provide both atom identity (isotope) and its position (x, y and z coordinates) in real 3D space at near-atomic resolution. The current presentation will illustrate the application of characterization of isotopes in nuclear materials based on researches utilizing the LEAP at MaCS, CAES since 2011. MaCS is part of Nuclear Science User Facilities (NSUF), and can be accessed both directly and through NSUF supported programs. ",
