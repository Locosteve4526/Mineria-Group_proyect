        "Description/Abstract": "Online MBA programs have undergone significant growth in recent years. However, quality assurance measures have not kept pace with this growth. The purpose of this study was to identify and prioritize aspects of quality assurance specific to AACSB-accredited online MBA programs. The Delphi methodology was used to facilitate a group conversation between expert administrators, faculty, and instructional designers around the topic of quality assurance for online MBA programs over the next 3-5 years. This paper reports the results of this study and how they will help to direct the efforts of those involved in the delivery of a quality online MBA program.",
