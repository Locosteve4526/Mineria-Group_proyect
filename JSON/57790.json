        "Description/Abstract": "\u03b1-crystallin is a major protein found in the mammalian eye lens that works as a molecular chaperone by preventing the aggregation of proteins and providing tolerance to stress in the eye lens. These functions of \u03b1-crystallin are significant for maintaining lens transparency. However, with age and cataract formation, the concentration of \u03b1-crystallin in the eye lens cytoplasm decreases with a corresponding increase in the membrane-bound \u03b1-crystallin, accompanied by increased light scattering. The purpose of this review is to summarize previous and recent findings of the role of the: (1) lens membrane components, i.e., the major phospholipids (PLs) and sphingolipids, cholesterol (Chol), cholesterol bilayer domains (CBDs), and the integral membrane proteins aquaporin-0 (AQP0; formally MIP26) and connexins, and (2) \u03b1-crystallin mutations and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the association of \u03b1-crystallin to the eye lens's fiber cell plasma membrane, providing thorough insights into a molecular basis of such an association. Furthermore, this review highlights the current knowledge and need for further studies to understand the fundamental molecular processes involved in the association of \u03b1-crystallin to the lens membrane, potentially leading to new avenues for preventing cataract formation and progression.",
