        "Description/Abstract": "Health care professionals\u2019 education is available using technology that allows learning to occur virtually. However, fostering a culture of collegiality and interprofessional education is challenging for an online environment. Our academic health science center includes five colleges, three of which offer graduate and undergraduate programs 100% online.  An innovative approach was necessary to meet accreditation standards for IPE with online education. In order to meet the needs of the online programs, an interprofessional team representing four colleges led the development of an innovative online interprofessional education program. The team modified and expanded our on-ground program for an online asynchronous experience using the university\u2019s online learning management platform. The program consisted of four modules addressing each of the IPE competencies: teams and teamwork, roles and responsibilities, communication, and values and ethics. The on-line IPE curriculum provided didactic, experiential and simulated clinical learning opportunities. Each module included nonclinical small group interactions and a clinical case study using interaction with a standardized patient/family/community agency through the discussion board. The didactic and experiential material allowed students to acquire knowledge and experience for each competency while case studies (patient/family or community) used simulation which required students to apply the knowledge gained. Interprofessional groups were formed with students representing 2-3 different health care professional programs and with a faculty facilitator from one of the five health science colleges. The didactic component consisted of videos and slides delivered as independent learning activities. The experiential learning afforded students interactive, team-based opportunities to get to know each other in a fun non-threatening way asynchronously through the discussion board. The simulated case study allowed application of knowledge and team-based skills asynchronously through discussion boards. Finally, faculty facilitators provided debriefing and feedback to the students, both on individual and team-based work.",
