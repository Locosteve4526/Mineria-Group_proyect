        "Description/Abstract": "While some research suggests that similar factors explain male and female offending, other studies have uncovered important differences in the significance and magnitude of predictors. The present study furthers this line of inquiry through a macro-level examination of male and female arrest rates for economic offenses. City-level data from the Uniform Crime Reports and the American Community Survey are used to separately examine gender-specific and gender-neutral predictors of male and female arrest rates for forgery/counterfeiting, fraud, and embezzlement. The results suggest both similarities and differences in predictors, and have important implications for future research. ",
