        "Description/Abstract": "MEIEROTTO, Lisa (Boise State U) Health and Well-being Disparities among Latina Farm Workers in Southwestern Idaho. Latina farm workers are among the most vulnerable populations in Idaho. These women experience a unique intersection of social and environmental factors that affect health and well-being. The disadvantages inherent in their gender, race, and social class are compounded by immigration status, rural location, and the hazards of farm work. As a result, Latina farm workers face multiple challenges ranging from food insecurity, social isolation, substandard housing, and limited health care to exposure to chemicals and injury hazards in the workplace. In this paper I discuss preliminary results from an ongoing ethnographic research project that aims to better understand Latina farm worker health and well-being",
