        "Description/Abstract": "A uniform pattern of quantum dots and nanowires were reproducibly fabricated by creating holes in a\ntwo-layer structure using atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation, dry-etching of polymer\nresists, and metal deposition through the indentation holes. The two-layer structure was created by\ndepositing a thin gold layer onto a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer on a silicon substrate.\nThe indentation depth was set so that the AFM tip penetrated the thin gold layer without the tip\ncontacting the silicon substrate. This two-layer indentation was used to create a pattern of holes in the\nthin gold layer. Then, the PMMA was exposed to an isotropic O2 plasma etchant through the holes in\nthe indentation pattern to form an undercut between the substrate and the gold layer. Quantum dots\nwere subsequently created through the deposition of gold on the exposed silicon substrate through the\nindentation holes. Gold nanowires were also fabricated by creating indentation holes consecutively\nand optimizing the distance between the holes using the same two-layer indentation method. The\ntopographic and electrical measurements of the fabricated gold nanowires suggest that our method is\ncapable of making uniform and reproducible nanowires. The scanning electron microscopy images of\nthe tips confirmed that the consecutive-hole-indentation method is less invasive than the conventional\nploughing method, where constant tip contact occurs with the substrate during the formation of\nnanowires",
