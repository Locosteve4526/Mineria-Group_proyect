        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The study addresses the challenge of detecting obfuscated malware, particularly memory-obfuscated variants, which evade conventional detection methods by targeting a system\u2019s volatile memory. By leveraging transformer-based models, notably BERT, the research demonstrates promising advancements in malware detection. Through data augmentation and rigorous feature selection processes, the study enhances the CIC-MlMem-2022 dataset, improving its quality for training classification models. Comparative analysis with conventional machine learning techniques highlights the superior performance of BERT and DistilBERT, achieving approximately 74% accuracy in classifying malware families. Notably, BERT exhibits exceptional capability in generalizing to unseen malware, achieving a remarkable 100% success rate in categorizing new families. These findings underscore the\u00a0 potential of transformer-based models for effectively detecting obfuscated malware, emphasizing the need for intelligent detection mechanisms in cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;",
