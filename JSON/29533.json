As managers of these spaces we can attract a diverse group into the space, but remaining inclusive is difficult. At this presentation Professors Vecchione and Brown will divulge strategies for success in creating makerspaces, adapting to user needs, empowering the users of the space, and showcasing collaborations. Attendees will engage in active learning and develop their own thoughts on leading the way for makerspaces at their institutions.",
