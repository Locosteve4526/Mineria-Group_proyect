        "Description/Abstract": "A cascade multilevel inverter consisting of a standard 3-leg inverter supplied by a DC source and three full H-bridges each supplied by a capacitor is considered for use as a motor drive. The capacitor H-bridges can only supply reactive voltage to the motor while the standard three leg inverter can supply both reactive and active voltage. A switching control algorithm is presented that shows this inverter topology can be used as an AC drive achieving considerable performance advantages (e.g., higher motor speed) compared to using a standard 3-leg inverter while at the same time regulating the capacitor voltages. The converter controller is a fundamental frequency switching controller based on programmed PWM to achieve higher efficiency (less power losses in the switches) compared to high-frequency PWM approaches. As is well known, the programmed PWM switching times are computed assuming the drive is in sinusoidal steady-state, that is, the derived switching angles achieve the fundamental while rejecting specified harmonics if the voltage waveforms are in sinusoidal steady-state. Here it shown that the switching commands to the converter can be implemented in a smooth fashion for voltage waveform commands whose frequency and amplitudes are continuously varying.",
