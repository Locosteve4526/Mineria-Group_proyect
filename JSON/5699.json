        "Description/Abstract": "Previous investigations into the morphology of Pyrrocoma liatriformis sensu lato in northern Idaho and adjacent Washington have revealed two distinct  morphologies that correspond to their geographical ranges. These same  populations and individuals have been analyzed using AFLP data. Over 400  loci were identified among all individuals using two sets of AFLP  adaptors. The data are in agreement with the morphological data and  separate the populations from the Snake River Canyon/Camas Prairie from  those of the Palouse grasslands. Data clustering methodologies using  both presence/absence data for all individuals and allele frequencies  for each population produced similar results. We suggest the name P. scaberula be resurrected to encompass the populations from the Snake River Canyon and Camas Prairie.",
