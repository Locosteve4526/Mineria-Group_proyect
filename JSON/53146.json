        "Description/Abstract": "Research suggests that sexual assault case attrition is a significant issue in the U.S. Of those assaults that are reported to law enforcement, only a portion result in an arrest, and even fewer are prosecuted. There are a variety of potential explanations for this case attrition ranging from the victim\u2019s declination to participate in the process to the criminal justice system\u2019s failure to adequately respond to these cases. In an effort to examine law enforcement\u2019s handling of these cases, a census of all sexual offense reports over a two-year period were gathered from one police department in the northwestern U.S. The analysis focuses on describing the characteristics of these cases, as well as examining predictors of arrest. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of policy, practice, and future research.",
