        "Description/Abstract": "Given current concerns about fake news and what constitutes legitimate scientific knowledge, writing courses offer a space to increase students\u2019 abilities to develop a critical literacy of science. This article explores the impact of a science writing themed first-year writing class on the development of critical literacy. In interviews a year or so after the course, participants reflected on what they learned from the class, revealing the degree to which they had developed a more critical understanding of science and what factors influenced their development and how they were using course concepts. Focusing primarily on science majors, this study explores the intersections of writing pedagogy, scientific literacy, and the rhetoric of science to make a case for including a critical focus on science in first-year writing courses.",
