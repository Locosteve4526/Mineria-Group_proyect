        "Description/Abstract": "A Lift Assist Team (LAT) was created on three units at a medical center where nursing staff were at high risk for patient-handling injuries. LAT members were drawn from the hospital's pool of patient transporters. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this case study summarizes the development, implementation, and experiences of the LAT. Nursing staff valued the LAT, reporting increased staff safety and improved patient care. LAT members reported greater job satisfaction and a newfound sense of assimilation into the nursing group compared to when their role was patient transport only. However, over time, their job responsibilities expanded beyond those officially designated for LAT members. Active, ongoing surveillance of the LAT's exposures and outcomes is warranted to understand whether patient-handling injury risk is shifting from nursing personnel to LAT members.",
