        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Background: Hygge practices embody joy, peace, mindfulness, coziness, and conviviality. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a progressive condition with complex therapies and physical limitations. Little is known about how hygge practice may impact individuals living with CF.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how adults with CF use hygge practices to promote wellness and cope with their progressive disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Methods: A qualitative phenomenological design and purposive network sampling were used to recruit a sample of adults with a diagnosis of CF who utilize hygge practices. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Colaizzi\u2019s thematic analysis approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Results: Fifteen individuals participated, eliciting insight into how hygge practices facilitate well-being. Themes reveal that hygge practices influence individuals' aesthetics, attitudes, and activities, and these influences deeply impact the physical and emotional experience of living with CF.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Hygge practices bring peace and comfort in various environments and circumstances, offering a holistic approach to well-being that transcends the burdens of life with CF. Through simple, intentional practices, hygge offers individuals the opportunity to experience hope and joy despite their daily stressors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Implications: Incorporating hygge into CF care may improve this community's psychological well-being and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;",
