        "Description/Abstract": "Irish step dance is an ancient art form revived in its modern incarnation by the Gaelic League in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Many of the features of Irish dancing as it is done today are characteristics shared by &quot;Gaelic dancing,&quot; as it was called in San Fransisco in the period from 1900-1935.",
