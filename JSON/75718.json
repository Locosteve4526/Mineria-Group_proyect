        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Traditionally, the west has understood \u201chumanity\u201d by using nature and animality as a foil\u2014by contrasting it with cultural achievements, language and learning. Recent advances in AI, however, have put anthropological designations like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;homo faber &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; homo linguisticus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; into question. The result is what Santoro and Monin have dubbed the \u201cAI Effect\u201d, a broad redefining of the human that brings new attributes to the fore. Despite all they can do, AI systems are unable to realize human realities essential to our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;having&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; (having feelings, relationships, perspectives, etc.) and our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;being&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; (our being moral, mortal, physical, etc.). We both &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; our bodies. Being, having, and embodiment together form the basis on which our values, practical wisdom, and character are realized.&lt;/span&gt;",
