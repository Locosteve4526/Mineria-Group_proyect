        "Description/Abstract": "When compared to other fields of study, nursing education is considered one of the most stressful and emotionally demanding. In order to train and retain nurses, it is important to understand students\u2019 experiences of stress to determine how best to support them. Despite the fact that  health leadership groups have identified a need for increased number of culturally competent nurses as a means to reduce health disparities, little has been documented in the literature regarding the experiences of culturally diverse nursing students. This qualitative phenomenological study explored the lived experiences of Latino/a pre-licensure nursing students via focus group interviews. Five main themes emerged from this study: \u201cstress of coursework,\u201d \u201cschool life balance,\u201d \u201cnavigating uncharted territory,\u201d \u201cfeeling unsupported,\u201d and \u201cstaying the course.\u201d By offering insight into the experiences of Latino/a nursing students, results of this study will help nursing programs understand how best to recruit and retain culturally diverse students. \nKeywords:  latino/a, minority, nursing student, stress, coping, diversity, nursing education\n",
