        "Description/Abstract": "Although prison rape has been recognised for years, it began to receive increased attention in the U. S. following the passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act. In addition to prevalence and victimisation estimates, several researchers have examined the attitudes of correctional personnel toward prison rape. However, few have surveyed the opinions of those not currently working in the criminal justice system. Drawing from the body of research on rape myths, our goal was to examine prison rape myth acceptance among a university student sample to describe these beliefs, as well as examine attitudinal correlates. The findings indicated that prison rape-supportive beliefs were evident among a minority of the sample, and were predicted by general punitiveness and male and female rape myth acceptance. The acceptance of victim-blaming myths identified in this study warrants further investigation. It is possible that educational efforts would be successful in reducing these rape-supportive beliefs.",
