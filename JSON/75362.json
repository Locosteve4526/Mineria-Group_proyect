        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Resilience refers to \u201can individual\u2019s ability to cope and adapt to challenges or adversity\u201d (Tsui &amp; Adam, 2023, p. 10) or \u201cthe ability to survive and thrive in the face of adversity\u201d (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2021, p. 63). The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for practicing nurses to operationalize resiliency skills in the health care work environment (Cao et al., 2021), and subsequently, resiliency has emerged as a topic of importance in the professional nursing literature. Extant research provides direction and guidance for the development, refinement, and application of resiliency skills for nurses to enhance personal and professional facets of life (Bui et al., 2023; Cochran &amp; Mealer, 2023; Gawlick et al., 2023; Rushton et al., 2023; Su et al., 2023). However, a gap in the literature exists concerning the development of resiliency skills for nurse scientists. Therefore, the purpose of this editorial is to highlight scholarly resilience as a viable skill that can support, promote, and augment the work of the nurse scientist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
