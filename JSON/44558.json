        "Description/Abstract": "Local governments have struggled to bring local water systems into compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act regulations since its passage in 19XX.  In spite of state and federal attempts to assist with the costs of testing and treating water to meet federal requirements such as revolving loan programs and Environmental Finance Centers focused on drinking water, many water systems fall short of full compliance.  Environmental scientists have identified three new challenges to water quality that are likely to stress municipal water systems further: bacterial contamination from pet waste, micro fibers\u2026and pharmaceuticals that are flushed into the water systems.  Traditional water treatment facilities are unlikely to be able to address these new environmental challenges.  This paper examines the ways in which municipal water systems are developing programmatic responses to these emerging environmental challenges by surveying water system managers in X number of cities located in the intermountain west region. [need to insert details about how many and why that region] The results provide insights into the capacities of municipal water systems to meet these new challenges, and investigates the presence of intergovernmental policy innovation ahead of federal regulatory ",
