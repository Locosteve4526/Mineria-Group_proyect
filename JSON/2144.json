        "Description/Abstract": "We give herein analytical formulas for the solutions of a class of boundary value problems (BVPs) discretized by Hermite collcation. Specifically, our ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are self-adjoint, homogeneous, and have constant coefficients. Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are considered. Analysis is provided which compares the discrete collocation solultion to the continuous solution. Computational examples are given.",
