        "Description/Abstract": "Secondary physical education, more specifically, the learning environment in mixed-gender physical education, is on red alert. Although physical educators face a myriad of problems--such as overcrowded classrooms, poor equipment and facilities, a time-crunched working schedule, and teaching in an unsupported content are--the real issue lies with the educator. Here, Shimon addresses the most common problem in secondary physical education, gender equity issues.",
