        "Description/Abstract": "Conceptual models of implementation posit contextual factors and their associations with evidence-based practice (EBP) use at multiple levels and suggest these factors exhibit complex cross-level interactions. Little empirical work has examined these interactions, which is critical to advancing causal implementation theory and optimizing implementation strategy design. Mixed effects regression examined cross-level interactions between clinician (knowledge, attitudes) and organizational characteristics (culture, climate) to predict cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic therapy use with youth (N\u2009=\u2009247 clinicians across 28 agencies). Results indicated several interactions, highlighting the importance of attending to interactions between variables at multiple levels to advance multilevel implementation theory and strategies.",
