        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most critical layer of evaluation consisted of the structural spine of the course. This included the learning objectives, high-level course structure and design, learning activities, and assessments. The key for this layer was to determine if the spine of each course was aligned. \u201c&lt;em&gt;We don\u2019t want scoliosis of the spine&lt;/em&gt;\u201d is a phrase often echoed while evaluating this layer.\u00a0Through the evaluation of Humentum\u2019s training courses, it is our belief that&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;Gibbons\u2019 (2013)&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;architectural approach to instructional design can be successfully applied as a framework for evaluation. In this manner, Gibbons\u2019 work extends to both sides of instructional design: the development and the evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;",
