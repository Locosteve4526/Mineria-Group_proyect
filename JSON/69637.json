        "Description/Abstract": "Continental Pedagogy refers to a way of thinking about educational practice that coalesced in Europe some 250 years ago and that continues to be elaborated today. Developed from the Greek pa\u03b9d\u1fb0gug\u1fd0\u1fb1 (paidagog\u00eda; paidos \u00bc child; agogos \u00bc leader) and rendered as la p\u00e9dagogie in French, pedagog\u00eda in Spanish and P\u00e4dagogik in German, Continental Pedagogy is based on understandings that are radically different from those taken for granted in education in the English-speaking world. Continental Pedagogy sees education as being primarily concerned neither with school and curricula, nor with the pedagogy in the English sense of the techniques and politics of teaching (Friesen, 2019). Instead, it begins with the insight that education and pedagogy are both about the influence that is exercised by one person or group (i.e., the educator) on another (i.e., the educand), and that this influence exists in special relation to the world. The resulting configuration of self, other and world forms what has been called the \u201cpedagogical triangle\u201d (Fig. 1; e.g., see: Brian\u00e7on, 2019). Within this configuration, pedagogy is particularly concerned with the personal experience of the educand with the educator (i.e., the pedagogical relation; Friesen, 2017) and with the educand\u2019s relationship with the world (Bildung, formaci\u00f3n, le formation).",
