        "Description/Abstract": "Salvador Plascencia\u2019s, The People of Paper, sets the groundwork for the simultaneous materiality/immateriality of the Latinx body and embodiment of social issues. The physiology of the Latinx population is seen as malleable\u2014as both visible and invisible\u2014as both ill and strong\u2014as both innocent and criminal\u2014in order to continue the health of the global world (Saturn). There is a need to employ resistance to phenomenology, biological determinism, and other remnants of eugenics in order to illustrate how brown bodies are built as a labor force that is both stripped and built in technological and \u201cprimitive\u201d terms simultaneously. This decolonizing perspective interrogates the ideas of technology and \u201cprogress\u201d through the materiality of the Latinx body in today\u2019s global society. This presentation draws on the characters\u2019 illness and immobility to illustrate the way Latinx bodies are treated as non-human and defined through their technological uses (laborers) while being represented in their very real bodies through illness, death, and their incarcerated incomprehensible brown bodies.
