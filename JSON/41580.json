        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate blood glucose changes, as measured by a continuous glucose monitoring system, that occur in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) following an acute bout of moderate-intensity walking after consuming a high-carbohydrate/low-fat meal. This study found that moderate-intensity walking induced greater postprandial glucose control compared with sedentary activity and it appears that moderate-intensity activity may be used to reduce postprandial glucose levels in women with GDM.",
