        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;I was selected as one of 20 participants in the Idaho State Board of Education's&lt;br&gt;prestigious Idaho OPAL Fellows Program. This program, supported by the Wiki&lt;br&gt;Education Foundation's Wiki Scholars Program, provides in-depth training on open&lt;br&gt;pedagogy and advocacy. Through a series of intensive online modules and weekly Zoom&lt;br&gt;meetings, I acquired expertise in the Wikipedia ecosystem. As part of this public scholarship, I\u00a0made a significant contribution to the scholarly record by creating the&lt;br&gt;first Wikipedia and Wikidata entries for Natalie Grant Wraga, a Russian-born historian&lt;br&gt;who played a crucial role in U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War. Wraga's work on&lt;br&gt;Russian disinformation practices has significantly influenced my own research in this&lt;br&gt;area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
