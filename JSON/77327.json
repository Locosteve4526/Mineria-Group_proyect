        "Description/Abstract": "Despite tremendous growth in sport participation of girls and women following Title IX in&lt;br&gt;1972, women\u2019s participation as sport coaches did not follow the same trajectory. In fact,&lt;br&gt;women remain significantly underrepresented in sport coaching. Research highlights ongoing&lt;br&gt;barriers within the sport industry's patriarchal structure, and although strategies have been&lt;br&gt;proposed to improve women\u2019s representation, the lack of progress over the past two decades&lt;br&gt;indicates limited effectiveness. A better approach is essential to address this issue across&lt;br&gt;individual, interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels. The purpose of this study is to&lt;br&gt;interview participants within the U.S. cross-country skiing program, Trail to Gold (T2G), to&lt;br&gt;learn about its programming and implementation, with an eye toward learning from this&lt;br&gt;comprehensive, multidimensional approach to help advance women coaches in all elite&lt;br&gt;sports. Eight coaches and administrators who participated in the T2G program completed&lt;br&gt;semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and reviewed by&lt;br&gt;participants for accuracy. Key themes were identified using both inductive and deductive&lt;br&gt;qualitative analysis methods, with final themes confirmed by triangulation. T2G participants&lt;br&gt;highlighted the importance of a supportive environment, robust networking, and effective&lt;br&gt;sponsorship to advance women in coaching roles. This study expands the recommended&lt;br&gt;strategies to increase women\u2019s representation in sports coaching by learning from women&lt;br&gt;coaches and administrators who work in environments that value and actively pursue gender&lt;br&gt;parity. Continued support for women coaches is essential for gender equality, enhanced team&lt;br&gt;performance, and a more inclusive sporting environment.",
