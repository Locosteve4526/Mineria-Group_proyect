        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;aureus&lt;/em&gt; is a primary agent of bovine mastitis, a costly disease that affects dairy cattle worldwide. In this study, we aimed to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of a cholera toxin-based &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bovine mastitis vaccine (IsdA+ClfA-CTA2/B) administered via the intramammary route with subcutaneous boost. Vaccine antigens included the &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; iron-regulated surface determinant A (IsdA) and clumping factor A (ClfA), each fused to a cholera toxin linking domain (CTA2) and co-expressed with the cholera toxin binding subunit (CTB). On Day 0, six Holstein cows received intramammary IsdA+ClfA-CTA2/B or buffer control. On Day 14, animals received an equivalent subcutaneous boost or control vaccination. One control cow developed an infection in two quarters shortly after Day 0, possibly related to intramammary control administration. No local or systemic vaccine-related adverse reactions were observed. Milk and serum were assessed for IsdA-CTA2/B, ClfA-CTA2/B and CTB-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 by ELISA. Vaccinated animals produced vaccine-specific responses in the whey and serum after completing the vaccination regimen. Vaccinated cows had decreased protein and solids-not-fat in milk on Day 14 after intramammary vaccination, but these decreases were resolved by Day 20. On Day 20, all cows received a low-dose intramammary homologous &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;challenge in opposite quarters. Unvaccinated animals had more clinically relevant mastitis events during challenge (3 events out 4). Shedding occurred in all cows throughout the 10-day challenge period. Despite significant antigen-specific antibody responses in vaccinated animals that were largely maintained throughout the challenge period, differences in somatic cell counts (SCC) and bacterial counts assessed by colony forming units (CFU/mL) were not statistically significant between groups. Overall, findings reveal a good safety profile for the IsdA+ClfA-CTA2/B vaccine and provide evidence of a strong induction of vaccine-specific humoral immunity in both milk and serum when administered via the intramammary route with a heterologous subcutaneous boost. The low-dose intramammary challenge model was effective to induce chronic shedding consistent with subclinical mastitis. Future trials with an increased diversity of antigens as well as increased sample sizes will enable better assessment of the vaccine\u2019s efficacy in reducing bacterial shedding and SCC and in providing protection against clinical mastitis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
