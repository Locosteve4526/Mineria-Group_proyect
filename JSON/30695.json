The Folio\u2019s national tour is a massive undertaking by the Folger Shakespeare Library, involving the work of librarians, Shakespeare experts, historians, exhibition designers, graphic designers, scholars of books and printing, dramaturgy and literature. This discussion will use the Folio exhibition as a point of departure for a discussion of the ways in which education in the arts and humanities prepares us for exciting, creative and socially useful collaborative work that we love.
