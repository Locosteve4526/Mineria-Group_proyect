        "Description/Abstract": "Education has been one of the primary beneficiaries of our collective creativity. If a half-century of text, film, television, and games and research can be our guide, we can make the accurate prediction about the future of education. In this presentation, Dr. Haskell (perhaps dressed as a Star Fleet officer) will identify trends in information access, technology tools, interfaces, artificial intelligence, describing their proliferation in an upbeat, TED-style and Star Trek-themed presentation. He will share research into how these tools and trends have changed education and those major changes on the horizon. Attendees will &quot;Boldy go where no [audience] has gone before.\r\n\r\nhttp://gamesineducation.org/symposium/",
