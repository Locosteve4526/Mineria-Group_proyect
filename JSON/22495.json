        "Description/Abstract": "Respiratory face masks are used in medical settings to provide patients with supplemental air and oxygen. The fit of a face mask must be good in order to achieve the necessary air pressure and flow rate conditions. Current face mask designs generally do not provide a good fit and frequently cause discomfort for patients when used for extended periods of time.  A new self inflating face mask interface has been developed that solves this problem. The invention consists of a thin flexible plastic or fabric \u201cskirt\u201d that surrounds the face-mask cup. The skirt inflates automatically when the face mask receives external air.  The skirt is flexible, soft, and adapts easily to the topography of the face which produces a good fit and adds to the comfort of the patient.",
