        "Description/Abstract": "Meeting your customers where they are has taken on a whole new meaning in the 2010s. Join Amy Vecchione, of Boise State University, and Tobie Garrick, of Boise Public Library, as they explore ways to provide improved reference outcomes for customers through mobile technology. Each librarian has implemented new reference tools for customers including: connecting users to reference tools with QR (Quick Response) codes, roving reference with mobile devices, SMS reference, and mobile database instruction during the reference process. Participants will learn about barriers, how each librarian overcame them, and how mobile reference can be improved.\n",
