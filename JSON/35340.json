        "Description/Abstract": "STEM employment is growing at twice the rate of other occupations, with computer-related fields demonstrating the greatest growth.  Yet, as the need for talent grows, the proportion of computer-related baccalaureates awarded to women declined from 28% in 2000 to 18% in 2013.  As part of an NSF-sponsored project, we examined gender differences as a first step to explaining the low numbers of female computer science (CS) graduates.  Our survey of 393 CS undergraduates found no significant differences in psychological traits like self-esteem and self-efficacy, but more women reported high stress.  The data pointed to possible differences only in student-faculty engagement, so future work will investigate other external variables that may help explain why CS is losing talented women.",
