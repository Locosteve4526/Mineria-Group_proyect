        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The course presented here is an iteration of Special Topics in Writing, Rhetoric, and Technical Communication, a required course for the Bachelor of Arts in Writing, Rhetoric, and Technical Communication degree at Boise State University. The course was taught by the first author, Dr. Jenn Mallette, an associate professor in the Department of Writing Studies, in Fall 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Focused on writing, rhetoric, and technical communication, the special topics course provides wide latitude for instructors to cover a range of topics related to writing studies, as long as the course addresses the program learning outcomes that focus on genres, audiences, craft of writing, and inquiry. As an avid home cook and consumer of food media, as well as a feminist and scholar who studies gender in technical communication, I determined that food could provide a lens to address these outcomes. Food texts also offer a lens to explore rhetoric through lived experiences, particularly through Indigenous, immigrant, and non-European/non-white perspectives. Thus, the course\u2019s readings and content provided avenues for all students to explore the rhetoric of food but sought to disrupt whiteness and patriarchy through the texts and rhetorical approaches we examined.&lt;/p&gt;",
