        "Description/Abstract": "In this study, we examined the relationship of special education teachers\u2019 performance on the RESET Explicit Instruction observation protocol with student growth on academic measures. Special education teachers provided video recorded observations of three instructional lessons along with data from standardized curriculum-based academic measures at the beginning, middle and end of the school year for the students in the instructional group. Teachers\u2019 lessons were evaluated by external, trained raters. Data were analyzed using many-faceted Rasch measurement (MFRM), correlation and multiple regression. Teacher performance on the overall protocol did not account for statistically significant variance in student growth beyond that of students\u2019 beginning of the year academic performance. An abbreviated teacher score based on items that had average or higher item difficulties on the MFRM analysis accounted for an additional 4.5% of variance beyond that of beginning of the year student performance. Implications for further research are discussed.",
