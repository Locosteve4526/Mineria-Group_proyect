        "Description/Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe a project  to convert a library intranet from HTML format to Wiki software and  presents evidence of the success of this project.\r\nDesign/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a pre- and post-survey of intranet users.\r\nFindings: Use of the intranet increases after the transition to a Wiki.  Updating does not increase, but is more evenly spread among departments  rather than being concentrated among technical staff.\r\nPractical implications: Wiki software is an excellent choice for a library intranet because it allows for easy editing and shared responsibility.\r\nOriginality/value: There are few articles written that assess the merits of Wiki  software. This article establishes an ongoing discussion of which new  web technologies have the most utility in a library setting.",
