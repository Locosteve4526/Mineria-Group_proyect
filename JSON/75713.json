        "Description/Abstract": "As Joachim Heydorn notes, his 1974 \u00dcberleben durch Bildung was writ-ten during a time of great \u201cperil\u201d (Gef\u00e4rdung), in the middle of the Cold War, with the survival of humanity in the balance. The path leading away from this grave peril, Heydorn argues, is Bildung. It offers not only an escape from imminent danger, but also from dehumanization: \u201chumanity cannot bear a dehumanized survival,\u201d Heydorn writes in concluding his text: \u201cSociety must be formed [gebildet] in such a way that it knows its human purpose and the danger in which it finds itself. The path between [purpose] and peril must be found.\u201d (1974: 273). Today, the conditions of the Anthropocene mean that the survival of the human race is again radically open to question. The threat in this case, however, is neither dehumanization nor nuclear destruction (although these remain im-portant); it is instead environmental degradation and catastrophic climate change. And Bildung\u2014especially in this broad sense of coming to know about oneself and one\u2019s condition\u2014is clearly relevant to it. But this is certainly not a Bildung that, as Heydorn remarks, represents \u201cthe pro-gressive liberation of humanity to itself\u201d (p. 273) and that is centered only on human purpose.",
