        "Description/Abstract": "Can a Team-Based Learning course structure enhance student learning (measured by exam performance) and increase student retention? Compared two sections of the same course: Students in one section worked on problems in teams, while in the other section, activity problems were presented as examples during lecture. The arrangement was reversed three times for a total of 4 modules. The final exam had 1 question from each module, and these scores were compared. Scores on final exam questions for students who worked in teams were higher than for students who received primarily lecture in three of the four comparisons; significantly higher in Module 3 (p &lt; 0.01). Prior to TBL implementation (F2011), 34.6% (9/26) students stopped participating in the course for the last 3 weeks or longer.  With TBL (S2013), 11.2% (25/224) stopped participation.\r\n",
