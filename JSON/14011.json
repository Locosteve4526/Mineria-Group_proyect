        "Description/Abstract": "Deception is a ubiquitous human behavior (although deception is not unique to humans).  On average we lie in 25% of all our interactions (conversations over 10 minutes) with others. While many of these deceptive interactions serve social functions,  other deceptions are extremely dangerous.  All 19 of the 9-11 terrorists lied to U. S. Government officials on at least 3 occasions, and not one of those deceptions was detected. Most people believe they can detect deception in interactions, but research shows they cannot.  Since 9-11 our Government has instituted deception deception programs at our airports and portals, but it has done so without research to show they work. This talk focuses on research aimed at solving these problems.  ",
