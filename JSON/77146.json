        "Description/Abstract": "Microbial communities living on plant leaves can positively or negatively influence plant health&lt;br&gt;and, by extension, can impact whole ecosystems. Most research into the leaf microbiome&lt;br&gt;consists of snapshots, and little is known about how microbial communities change over time.&lt;br&gt;Weather and host physiological characteristics change over time and are often collinear with&lt;br&gt;other time-varying factors, such as substrate availability, making it difficult to separate the&lt;br&gt;factors driving microbial community change. We leveraged repeated measures over the course of&lt;br&gt;an entire year to isolate the relative importance of environmental, host physiological, and&lt;br&gt;substrate age-related factors on the assembly, structure, and compositionstructure of leaf-&lt;br&gt;associated fungal communities. We applied both culturing and sequencing approaches to&lt;br&gt;investigate these communities, focusing on a foundational, widely-distributed plant of&lt;br&gt;conservation concern: basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata). We found&lt;br&gt;that changes in alpha diversity were independently affected by the age of leavesa community and&lt;br&gt;the air temperature. Surprisingly, Ttotal fungal abundance and species richness were not&lt;br&gt;positively correlated and responded differently, sometimes oppositely, to weather. With regard to&lt;br&gt;beta diversity, communities were more similar to each other across similar leaf ages, air&lt;br&gt;temperatures, leaf types, and \u03b4 13 C stable isotope ratios. Nine different genera were differentially&lt;br&gt;abundant with air temperature, \u03b4 13 C, leaf type, and leaf age, and a set of 20 genera were&lt;br&gt;continuously present across the year. Our findings highlight the necessity for longer-term,&lt;br&gt;repeated sampling to parse drivers of temporal change in leaf microbial communities.",
