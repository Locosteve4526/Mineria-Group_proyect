        "Description/Abstract": "Salmonella typhimurium infects an estimated 1.4 million in the United States and kills over five hundred annually.  The current way of categorization, Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and antibiotic sensitivity testing, lack the ability to distinguish between some closely related strains.  We are attempting to optimize a new technique of categorization, Multiple Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA).  We made changes to temperature and concentration variables within the multiplex PCR procedure to streamline the identification process.  By optimizing the multiplex PCR procedure we intend to create more consistent amplification of the loci used in MLVA analysis, which will improve efficiency in differentiating S. typhimurium isolates.
