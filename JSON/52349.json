        "Description/Abstract": "Infant positioning in daily life, particularly in relation to active neck and back muscles, may affect spinal development, psychosocial progression, and motor milestone achievement. Yet the impact of infant body position on muscle activity is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate neck and back muscle activity of healthy infants in common positions and baby devices. Healthy full-term infants (n\u00a0=\u00a022, 2-6\u00a0months) participated in this experimental study. Daily sleep and positioning were reported by caregivers. Cervical paraspinal and erector spinae muscle activity was measured using surface electromyography (EMG) in five positions: lying prone, lying supine, held in-arms, held in a baby carrier, and buckled into a car seat. Mean filtered EMG signal and time that muscles were active were calculated. Paired t-tests were used to compare positions to the prone condition. Caregivers reported that infants spent 12% of daily awake time prone, 43% in supine-lying baby gear, and 44% held in-arms or upright in a baby carrier. Infants exhibited highest erector spinae activity when prone, and lowest cervical paraspinal muscle activity in the car seat. No differences were found between in-arms carrying and babywearing. This first evaluation of the muscle activity of healthy infants supports the importance of prone time in infants' early spinal development because it promotes neck and back muscle activity. Carrying babies in-arms or in baby carriers may also be beneficial to neck muscle development, while prolonged time spent in car seats or containment devices may be detrimental to spinal development.",
