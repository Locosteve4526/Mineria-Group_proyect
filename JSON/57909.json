        "Description/Abstract": "Indigenous people experience a higher rate of intimate partner violence (IPV) than other&lt;br&gt;racial/ethnic groups; however, limited research examines IPV among this population. In&lt;br&gt;collaboration with a tribe in the western United States, this study surveyed a sample of&lt;br&gt;Indigenous people (N = 27) to learn about their experiences with victimization. Results&lt;br&gt;show that respondents experienced high amounts of recent relationship and lifetime&lt;br&gt;victimization, mostly consistent with previous literature. Additional issues and challenges&lt;br&gt;emerged from the data, such as low reporting rates and service accessibility. These&lt;br&gt;findings are contextualized within prior IPV literature, and we offer recommendations for&lt;br&gt;future research.",
