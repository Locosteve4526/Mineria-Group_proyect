        "Description/Abstract": "This report summarizes the discussions of the Working\r\nGroup on Acquisition Quality at the International Workshop\r\non Document Image Analysis for Libraries, Palo\r\nAlto, CA, 23-24 January 2004. Acquisition of the image is\r\none of the most time intensive components of forming a\r\ndigital library, and the quality of the acquisition will affect\r\nall later stages of the digital library project. The current\r\nstate of the art in acquisition is analyzed. Problems and\r\nsuggested improvements for image acquisition and\r\nstorage formats and the special problems associated with\r\nacquisition from microfilm follows. A list of general\r\nsuggestions was developed which was complemented by a\r\nwish list of things the Working Group would like to see\r\nfollowed in acquisition discussions in the future.",
