        "Description/Abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study was to conduct a secondary analysis by combining 2 pedometer data sets to describe and analyze pedometer-determined steps/day of children by ethnicity and metropolitan status. \nMethods: Participants were 582 children (309 girls, 273 boys; 53% Hispanic, 26% Caucasian, 21% African American) age 10 to 11 years (M = 10.37 \u00b1 0.48) attending 1 of 10 schools located in urban, suburban, and rural settings. Participants wore a research grade pedometer for at least 3 week/school days. Mean steps/ day were analyzed by gender, ethnicity, and metropolitan status.\nResults: Statistical analyses indicated 1) boys (12,853 \u00b1 3831; P &lt; .001) obtained significantly more steps/day than girls (10,409 \u00b1 3136); 2) African American (10,709 \u00b1 3386; P &lt; .05) children accumulated significantly less steps/day than Hispanic (11,845 \u00b1 3901) and Caucasian (11,668 \u00b1 3369) children; and 3) urban (10,856 \u00b1 3706; P &lt; .05) children obtained significantly less steps/day than suburban (12,297 \u00b1 3616) and rural (11,934 \u00b1 3374) children. \nConclusions: Findings support self-report data demonstrating reduced physical activity among African American children and youth, especially girls, and among children and youth living in urban areas. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are explored.",
