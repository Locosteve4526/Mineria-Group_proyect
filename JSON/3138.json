        "Description/Abstract": "Detection limits and reduced mobilities for 12 ribonucleotides and 4  ribonucleosides were measured by ambient pressure electrospray  ionization\u2013ion mobility spectrometry (ESI\u2013IMS). With the instrument used  in this study it was possible to separate some of these compounds  within mixtures. Detection limits reported for ribonucleotides and  ribonucleosides ranged from 15 to 300 pmol and the reduced mobilities  ranged from 41 to 56 suggesting that ambient pressure ESI\u2013IMS may be  used for their rapid and sensitive separation and detection. This report  demonstrates that it was possible to use ion mobility spectrometry  (IMS) to obtain a spectrum for the separation of nucleotides and  nucleosides in less than 1 min. The application holds great promise for nucleotide analysis in the area of separating DNA fragments in genome sequencing  and also for forensics DNA typing examinations used for the  identification of blood stains in crime scenes and paternity testing.",
