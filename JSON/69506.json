        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;INTRO: The 2021 annual report by the Center for Collegiate Mental\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0reported that of 153,233\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0who sought university counseling, 65.5% reported anxiety as a problem, 49.1% reported stress, and 47.2% experienced depression. Over the past twenty years,\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;college&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0counseling services have also experienced explosive and increasing demand and are struggling to keep up with increasing student needs. In order to help with the demand,\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;college&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0campuses are seeking numerous ways to help with these challenges. Of interventions studied,\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;positive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0psychological approaches, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques are the most impactful interventions that have demonstrated the greatest efficacy, particularly in improving\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;positive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While most\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;college&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;wellness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0courses tend to focus more on physical\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and show improvements on physical efficacy, it would make sense that if the same\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;course&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, with additional emphasis on psychological\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and consistently integrating and practicing techniques like CBT, might also improve\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;positive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0scores.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purpose:&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The purpose of this study is to see if two 15-week\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;wellness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;college&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0courses, taught concurrently from two different perspectives (e.g., traditional approach and CBT approach), will significantly reduce\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and increase\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;positive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0in\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;college&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-age\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hypothesis:&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;1) Both the control and experimental\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;wellness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0courses will facilitate decreased\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0trait\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and increased\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;positive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0trait\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2) If changes in\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0are significant across the 15-week semester, we will test whether improved cognitive distortion scores that occur in the experimental\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;course&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, act as a mediator to changes in\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;positive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0Male and female\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;college&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-age\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0(18-50 years), from different backgrounds and different majors, will be recruited on a volunteer basis after enrolling in one of two 15-week\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;wellness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0courses (EXHS 155 at CWI and KINES 141 at BSU).\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0will attend two-hours and thirty-minutes of lecture time per week for 15 weeks. Both courses will be taught face-to-face during concurrent semesters (Spring 23) by highly qualified instructors.This study is an experimental design with pre-and post-tests administered to experimental and control groups.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0will complete the demographic/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;wellness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0questionnaire during the second class of the semester only; they will complete the PANAS-Gen during the second and last classes of the semester, and the CD-Quest will be completed in the second class, and every 3 weeks during the semester (weeks 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14).\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Statistical Analysis:&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A mixed model repeated measures ANOVA analysis will be conducted (P\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0.05), with group assignment as the independent variable and changes in PANAS-Gen score as the dependent variable. Previous therapy may be used as a possible covariate. A mixed model repeated measures ANOVA analysis will be conducted to assess changes in cognitive distortions using the CD-Quest results. If statistically significant (p&lt;0.005) changes are found in PANAS-Gen scores from pre-to post-intervention, a mediation linear regression analysis will be run to examine whether changes in PANAS-Gen scores were mediated by changes in cognitive behavioral strategies (CD-Quest). Statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS V28.0.1.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expected Outcomes:&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;wellness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0courses will result in improved\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;positive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0scores. For the experimental\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;course&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, reduced cognitive distortions will mediate reductions in\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;",
