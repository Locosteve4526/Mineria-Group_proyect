        "Description/Abstract": "In this workshop faculty will explore the use of open licensing concepts in student work. We will look at how to scaffold copyright and licensing ideas that can enable students to find material, re-mix (re-write, edit, etc.) it, and provide proper attribution to materials they may then assign an open license to, and of course submit for credit in a given course. Faculty attending the workshop will be given examples and come away with a possible structure for using open licensing concepts in their course.",
