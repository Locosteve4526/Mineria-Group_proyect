For the past 30 years, my wearable artwork has explored concepts relating to the body, loss of innocence, and social action. This presentation will begin by giving context to my artwork, sharing briefly the bodies of work that have led to my current exploration, as well as briefly sharing my Judaica practice (Jewish ritual objects) which has always been and continues to be a separate but related side of my art practice.&lt;/p&gt;",
