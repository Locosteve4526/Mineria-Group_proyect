        "Description/Abstract": "The use of physiological  recordings to make inferences about the truthfulness of a person's  statements has a long and controversial history in both psychological  science and the law. Frye v. United States, the famous  1923 case that set the general legal standard for the admissibility of  scientific evidence for most of this century, concerned the use of a  blood pressure test for the detection of deception. The Frye decision generally closed the door on the  legal admissibility of polygraph tests in most jurisdictions for seventy  years. In  psychological science, some of the greatest names in the early history  of psychology were interested in the assessment of credibility by  physiological measures. Despite  this early interest by scientists, very little research on the topic of  the psychophysiological credibility assessment was published during the  first 75 years of this century. However, since 1975, and particularly  during the last 10 years, a great deal of scientific research on  psychophysiological credibility assessment has been published. The  favorable results of much of that research, and the recent rejection of  the long standing Frye standard by the U. S.  Supreme court  http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1322780626984&amp;returnToKey=20_T13417580347&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.170556.0851471447#n6&quot;&gt;have caused  a number of courts to reconsider the issue of admitting the results of  polygraph tests at trial.",
