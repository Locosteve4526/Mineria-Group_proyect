        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Online faculty have been using, creating, and remixing Open Educational Resources (OER) to replace textbooks in their courses. OER are shown to improve learning by reducing costs and providing accessible materials to students. Less is known about the impact on faculty. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential to use analytics to identify OER impacts on student learning within Boise State; and understand the experiences of faculty and students in adopting OER in online learning settings.&lt;br&gt;Project Overview&lt;br&gt;By partnering with faculty at Boise State who use OER, remix OER, create OER, and use open pedagogy in their online courses, we will study 1) the relationship between OER use and student outcomes based on institutional metrics, and 2) the experience of adopting OER and open pedagogy in online settings.&lt;br&gt;Research Questions&lt;br&gt;How does using, remixing, creating OER and using open pedagogy impact student success in online course settings? Can we determine that with small scale studies?&lt;br&gt;What is the experience of students and faculty when using OER and open pedagogy in their courses? How do they describe the efficacy of the resources used?\u00a0&lt;br&gt;Hypothesis\u00a0&lt;br&gt;Students may have higher success rates on a small scale due to immediate access to the material and reduction in textbook or materials costs.&lt;br&gt;Students may feel OER and open pedagogy contributed to success in their online courses.&lt;br&gt;Faculty may initially have concerns about the OER materials or open practices but subsequently develop a positive attitude after implementation.&lt;/p&gt;",
