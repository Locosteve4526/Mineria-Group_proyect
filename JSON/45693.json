        "Description/Abstract": "Okay, maybe it is a little about spa days, but self-care is not just a buzz word that means sneaking away from work to get a facial. Authentic self-care is a valuable tool that can prevent employee burnout and create a more productive and inclusive work environment. In this session, we will reflect on our own perceptions of self-care and how this may differ from our colleagues. We will talk about the importance of setting healthy boundaries and why self-care should not be an &quot;if I have time&quot; thing, but should be fully incorporated throughout every day. Employees will gain tools to help plan and advocate for their own self-care, while supervisors and managers will learn techniques to build a culture of support for self-care in their libraries. No matter your level of self-care competency, all participants will leave with a fuller self-care toolkit.",
