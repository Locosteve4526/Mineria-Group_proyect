        "Description/Abstract": "Electronic devices made with alternating layers of undoped and doped chalcogenide materials,\nGe 2 Se 3 /Ge 2 Se 3 -M exhibit transistor-like current-voltage (I-V) curves when illuminated. In this\nwork, the effect of the metal dopant on the transistor characteristics are measured. The transistor\nmaterials are characterized using UV-Vis to explore the band gap and electronic structure.\nRaman spectroscopy is used to verify incorporation of M into the Ge 2 Se 3 material.\nPhotoconduction is investigated using electrical characterization as a function of wavelength and\nlight intensity. The devices were tested from 385 to 1200 nm and were operational over that\nentire range.\n",
