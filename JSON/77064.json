        "Description/Abstract": "The prevalence of pediatric chronic conditions is increasing rapidly. Parents of a child with medical complexity (CMC) experience stress, depression which may also impact family functioning. Research has shown that mindfulness applications (apps) have significantly improved stress and depression in other populations, but have not been studied in this population. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a mindfulness app in parents of a CMC. Parents were recruited to participate from a non-profit organization and asked to use a mindfulness app for 4\u00a0weeks and fill out questionnaires before and after the intervention. Eight mothers participated in the study for the entire study period. Data analysis showed that using a mindfulness app in this population is feasible and reduces depressive symptoms and improves family functioning.",
