        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Significant change continues within healthcare and the nursing profession. To decrease health disparities and the costs of treatment and care, focus has turned toward prevention and population health and away from episodic acute care. This emphasis will require nurses to take on important operational and leadership roles in programs established to improve the health of the nation. These roles include identifying and mitigating social, environmental, and behavioral risk factors; assessing needs; and ensuring equitable healthcare for all. In addition to having strong population health knowledge and skills, nurses must also demonstrate confidence working autono\u00admous\u00adly, collaboratively, and innovatively as they lead in promoting community and population health. In addition, nurses will need to create new services and organizations that reduce disparities in targeted populations. Some in the nursing profession see this focus as new, but population health isn\u2019t new to nursing. It\u2019s core to what nurses have been doing for centuries&lt;/span&gt;",
