        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Natural Ventilation in Buildings in Support of&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sustainable Urban Development&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Context:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Incorporating natural ventilation design features into existing as well as new buildings under construction can support ecologically sustainable development globally. Natural ventilation in buildings can reduce the demand for electrical energy significantly by limiting the need for mechanical ventilation and air conditioning during hot weather conditions.\u00a0 Additionally, natural ventilation can improve indoor health and well-being by diluting and removing irritants and pathogens in the air such as bacteria, viruses, pollen and harmful gases. Reducing the consumption of electrical energy while at the same time enhancing the health and wellness of persons living inside a building should always be considered when promoting ecological and sustainable urban development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Laboratory wind tunnel tests were conducted using a 1:50 scale model of an interior living space with one exterior exposure only. Such a situation normally does not allow for cross-ventilation. The goal was to identify new designs configurations that can result in room pressures differences leading to induced cross ventilation. Various design features for redirecting exterior airflow into and out of the interior space were evaluated. Airflow patterns were visualized using smoke tracers. Interior and exterior air velocities were measured using a precision thermoanemometer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The data showed that natural airflow inside an indoor space with only one exterior exposure is generally limited to about 1% of the exterior airflow. However, adding perpendicular panels that redirect the outdoor air into the interior space increased the indoor ventilation rates significantly. Using four different panel configurations, indoor airflow (natural ventilation) was increased from 1% to 30%, 39%, 56% and to 65%.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applying the new window design features will allow natural ventilation to be incorporated easlily into buildings previously not considered suitable for such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Natural ventilation, Window design, Health and safety, Energy savings&lt;/p&gt;",
