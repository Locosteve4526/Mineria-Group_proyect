        "Description/Abstract": "Implementation theory suggests that first-level leaders, sometimes referred to as middle managers, can increase clinicians' use of evidence-based practice (EBP) in healthcare settings by enacting specific leadership behaviors (i.e., proactive, knowledgeable, supportive, perseverant with regard to implementation) that develop an EBP implementation climate within the organization; however, longitudinal and quasi-experimental studies are needed to test this hypothesis.",
