        "Description/Abstract": "Unitary Business (Topic # 1012), is part of an online database for tax practitioners called &quot;Catalyst&quot;  and is available on the Thomson Reuters Checkpoint  database. Topic #1012 is a state-by-state examination of each state's specific definition of a unitary business as it\napplies to corporate taxpayers. The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S.\nConstitution limits the ability of states to tax the income of multistate corporations. A state may only tax an apportioned share of income earned by a unitary business with a sufficient connection to the state. A multistate corporation (or affiliated group of corporations) doing business in a state must determine\nwhich of its operations are in the same unitary business as its in-state activities. Most of the guidance comes from U.S. Supreme Court opinions interpreting the Due Process Clause in the context of state corporate taxation. Topic #1012 reviews those opinions-which provide general, nationwide guidance-and then summarizes each state's specific definition of a unitary business through statutes,rulings, court opinions, or other authorities.\nPage Number:  178",
