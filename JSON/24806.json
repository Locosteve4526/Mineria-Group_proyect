        "Description/Abstract": "A prototype facemask interface was developed to help improve patient comfort during non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The prototype design includes a flexible fabric \u201cskirt\u201d which is attached to the frame of a standard facemask. The interface adapts easily to the contours of the face and provides increased contact area with the skin. The performance of the prototype facemask was compared to the performance of a standard facemask using a manikin. Air pressure and volume airflow through the masks were controlled. The results showed that the flow and pressure characteristics of the prototype facemask including the skirt interface were comparable to those of the standard facemask technology. The prototype reduced the facemask pressure levels on the face by allowing the interface skirt to \u201cfloat\u201d on the skin. ",
