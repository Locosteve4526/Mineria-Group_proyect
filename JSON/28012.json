        "Description/Abstract": "I revised chapters one and two during Summer 2015 in order to reorder the chapters and significantly expand on an analysis of Joseph Conrad's works (thus ordering the chapter topics chronologically rather than topically). I drafted a chapter on the war and pandemic's affective experience on masculine identity. This semester, I will expand this chapter (adding further analysis of Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and Lawrence's Aaron's Rod) which will complete chapters three and four.",
