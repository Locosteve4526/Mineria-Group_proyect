        "Description/Abstract": "Fan cultures typically develop around books, television and films, and often focus on characters or celebrities. Fandoms (specific fan subcultures) develop language and vernaculars, name themselves and their subgroups, create social structures and determine accepted, expected behaviors that reflect their shared values and meanings. Cultural assumptions are revealed through values, myths and understandings embedded in a fandom\u2019s language and stories. The Supernatural Family exemplifies how storytelling creates cultural myths, which then become part of the fandom\u2019s culture and identity. The SPN Family reflects the values expressed in the program through the stories they share. Narratives of family belonging, taking care of their own, fighting the good fight, unity and strength, and unwavering loyalty create a mythic Winchester-esque dynamic. Being part of the Family opens the door to a life where \u201cwhat would a Winchester do\u201d seems the unspoken motto. ",
