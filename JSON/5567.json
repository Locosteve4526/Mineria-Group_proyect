        "Description/Abstract": "Mass customization, one of the hallmarks of Web 2.0, uses computational processes that mirror human procedures of matching and categorization to personalize web applications for their users. As these processes continue to proliferate, it is important to understand the logics and cultural assumptions that empower them. To that end, this article examines the data preparation, matching, and communications workflows of online dating site eHarmony.com as a procedural rhetoric. It argues that the ideological perspective from which the site's functionality was developed creates a paternalistic relationship with its users that defines the subject positions and relationship formations made available to them.",
