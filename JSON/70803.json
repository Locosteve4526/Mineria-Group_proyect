        "Description/Abstract": "Based on a sample of Vertically Integrated Projects at Boise State University, this article proposes a schema for differentiating project-based course designs that rely variously on two commonly-cited factors, student choice and collaboration. While some literature names these factors as traits of &quot;high-quality&quot; project-based learning, this article recommends choosing course designs appropriate to disciplinary and institutional norms, teacher preference, and other factors.",
