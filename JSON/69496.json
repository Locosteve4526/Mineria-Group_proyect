        "Description/Abstract": "Early-stage investigators (ESI) have unique barriers to research success, but little is&lt;br&gt;known about factors contributing to research success from the faculty perspective. Qualitative data from 10 faculty at an R2 institution in the southwestern United States were collected following participation in a Pilot Project Program (PPP) supported by the [BLINDED FOR REVIEW]. The major themes that emerged from qualitative analysis centered around institutional research culture (e.g., caliber and collegiality of faculty, teaching and students); and the common challenges and supports related to securing financial resources, accessibility and information from previous awardees and senior faculty, mentoring, grant writing support, administrative support, preliminary external reviews for grants, and identifying community collaborators. Our study reinforces that research culture, an institutional factor, is as important as individual facilitators and barriers for research development. If institutions are committed to transitioning from traditionally teaching focused universities to research intensive institutions, it&lt;br&gt;is important to consider both institutional and individual factors that drive success in ESI. Future studies of research productivity among ESI should further examine how individual level factors interact with institutional factors to build research capacity.",
