        "Description/Abstract": "The workbook Learning Through Practice: Doing Statistics was written to get students to do and write with data driven questions for students to practice statistical methods and write explanations of statistical concepts. Questions emphasize choosing appropriate procedures, executing correct methodology using software (primarily R) or formulas for simple inferences, and writing interpretations of results. Students develop their understanding of relationships between variables through simple linear regression with inference for slope, chi-square tests and ANOVA. Sections include questions that encourage students to\n1) reason critically, including understanding the limitations of the procedures,\n2) reflect on when and why procedures are used, \n3) develop multivariate thinking and\n4) discuss concepts in groups. \nUsed in an algebra-based statistical methods course, this workbook is written for students who have had no prior statistics course with the goal of preparing them for a second course in statistics or research methods in the sciences.\n",
