        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nurse leaders depend upon resiliency skills to support their practice. It is important to provide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;opportunities for nursing students to learn, practice, and observe these skills, which are needed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to navigate challenging work environments. This article describes the impact of a resiliency &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;curricular component in a grant-funded BSN elective course, Concepts of Primary Care. Program &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;evaluation was performed using a pre/posttest format and 2 surveys, the Brief Resilience Scale &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(BRS) and the Brief Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS). Three open-ended questions were administered upon completion of the elective course. A concurrent nested design was utilized with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a thematic analysis undertaken to analyze qualitative data. Analysis of quantitative data was&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;performed using descriptive statistics. Undergraduate BSN students showed an overall increase &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in resiliency (BRS: P = .112; BCRS: P = .064), and responses to open-ended questions supported &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the ability to apply and analyze most of the resiliency skills presented during the didactic portion &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of the elective course. This course promoted the development and refinement of undergraduate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;BSN student resilience skills. Integration of resilience content in the primary care course also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;supported student professional development. The addition of resiliency concepts and skills into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;undergraduate nursing curricula is recommended to enhance the ability of novice nurses to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;address work-related challenges and promote career satisfaction for the future. Key words: BSN &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;students, curriculum, nursing workforce, primary care, resilience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;doi: 10.1097/NAQ.0000000000000631&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
