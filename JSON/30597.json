        "Description/Abstract": "Interprofessional education is a widely sought initiative within higher educational institutions, but many examples focus primarily on collaboration between graduate clinical students.  As the initiative continues, it is recommended that many of the competencies be implemented much sooner, in the undergraduate curriculum, and should include all disciplines involved in the healthcare system.  This session will offer an example of an interprofessional capstone course that encourages the collaboration of health informatics and information management students with nursing, health science studies, and respiratory care students.  While the curriculum is intended to meet certain learning outcomes, it is also important to consider the perspectives of both the students and faculty.  A reflection of the experience will be shared, with a discussion around the potential areas for improvement in future efforts.",
