        "Description/Abstract": "            &lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The influx of international students to the United States has been steadily increasing, with a substantial number of students choosing to pursue their education in this diverse and culturally rich nation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0The current study delves into the psychological well-being of international students in the US, aiming to uncover the extent of well-being and its relationship with demographics and background characteristics.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0A secondary data analysis of\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0= 13,242 international students from the 2022 American College Health Association\u2019s National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA) provided insight into their well-being, stress levels, gender, grade level, and ethnicity.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0Most students reported moderate to high psychological well-being, underscoring their resilience. However, gender, grade level, and stress levels emerged as significant predictors of well-being, with female and graduate students facing particular challenges. Interestingly, while effective in univariate analyses, ethnicity did not play a pivotal role in predicting well-being in the final model, suggesting mediation by factors like acculturation stress and social support.\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0The findings hold implications for educational institutions, policymakers, support service providers, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of tailored support and policies to enhance the well-being of international students.&lt;/span&gt;        ",
