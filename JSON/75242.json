        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this study, we explore whether the use of words related to innovation and creativity (i.e.,\u00a0&lt;em&gt;creativity-speak&lt;/em&gt;) has an effect on crowdfunding campaign success, and also whether that relationship is contingent on project type, words expressing positive tone, and gratitude. Utilizing &lt;/span&gt;computer-aided text analysis (CATA) on the text of 248,614 crowdfunding campaigns revealed that &lt;span&gt;crowdfunding backers respond positively to creativity-speak. Although we find that both &lt;/span&gt;product-based campaigns (e.g., games, technology, design) and content-based campaigns (e.g., film, music, publishing)&lt;span&gt;should emphasize creativity-speak in their text to increase their chance of successful funding, the benefit of creativity-speak is especially strong for product-based campaigns. &lt;/span&gt;In addition, both positive linguistic tone and the use of words expressing gratitude in the text of the campaign strengthen the positive effect of creativity-speak on campaign success. Our study offers theoretical implications for the study of creativity, innovation, and crowdfunding as well as practical applications to individuals seeking funding for new products or services through crowdfunding.&lt;/p&gt;",
