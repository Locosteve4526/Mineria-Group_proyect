        "Description/Abstract": "The FBI uses polygraph tests as an investigative tool. This analysis addressed current FBI practices that recently resulted in a post-polygraph confession being suppressed.   The results of this analysis indicate that current FBI polygraph practices, as compared to scientific best practices, increase the risk to the actually innocence of wrongful accusation and interrogation by 249%. The FBI practices result in substantial losses of Information Gain across base rates. If these results are representative of law enforcement practices, then thousands of innocent people each year are being needlessly subjected to wrongful accusations, interrogation and the risk of false confession.
