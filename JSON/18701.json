Do you teach middle school students who just want to use Google? Do you teach college level information literacy? If you said yes to any of those questions, this workshop is for you. The material presented in this workshop will help guide you towards new ideas for instruction that use active learning and constructivist principles, particularly how they apply to mobile devices and mobile learning. We\u2019ll discuss how to adapt instruction to the new culture of learning.",
