        "Description/Abstract": "In 2009, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) began requiring an annual \u201cintegrated report\u201d from all companies listed on the exchange.  The JSE\u2019s action was ground-breaking in several ways.  It was the first exchange to mandate reports that integrated financial and non-financial information as a condition of listing.  Also, the requirement specifically connects corporate reporting with sustainability, an approach that signals a new paradigm for corporate reporting.  This paper investigates South Africa\u2019s integrated reporting law and argues that the country\u2019s New Governance approach is a more effective method for improving corporate reporting as a sustainability tool than are traditional regulatory approaches.",
