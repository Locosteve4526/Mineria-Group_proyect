        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Government, industry and communities require more technical, policy, and educational support as the current workforce in mining and environmental management retires and mining reform takes place on public lands. There are international and domestic drivers supporting a more resilient, diverse, and secure supply chain of critical minerals for both economic and national security. Items such as solar panels, large capacity batteries, semiconductors as well as the components and critical minerals/materials necessary to build them will require broad shifts in policy and workforce development to increase raw material availability on the timeframes demanded to meet clean energy standards. Furthermore, processes for public engagement and education, permitting, as well as training and cooperation with industry will be necessary to reimagine old systems. This collaborative piece examines perspectives, gaps, and synergistic opportunities to balance community needs within the ecosystem of global development.&lt;/span&gt;",
