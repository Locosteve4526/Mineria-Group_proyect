        "Description/Abstract": "There is increasing emphasis in preventing patient-ventilator asynchrony. Asynchrony may increase ventilator induced lung injury. Proportional Assist Ventilation (PAV) is a mode allowing the patient's effort to impact the support delivered by the ventilator. This patient-ventilator interaction might better acclimate to the patient's change in resistance, compliance and work of breathing. Recent publications show that PAV reduces patient-ventilator asynchrony. This mode is available on the Puritan Bennett 840 and 980 as PAV+. This bench study evaluated changes in peak pressure and tidal volume, at different time constants, as Percent Support and Amplitude (simulating patient effort) increased using an electronic lung simulator.",
