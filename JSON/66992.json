        "Description/Abstract": "Nursing staff assessment to accurately identify pressure injury (PrI) risk is a hallmark in PrI prevention care. Risk scores from the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk (hereafter Braden), a commonly used tool for assessing PrI risk, signal the need for preventative care. Braden Mobility, Activity, and Sensory Perception subscale subgroups associated with repositioning movement features help identify preventative strategies that minimize pressure intensity and duration. Evidence confirming subscale rating accuracy is needed. This study compared assessment score accuracy with movement data collected via accelerometer sensor. Sample included 913 nursing home residents from the Turn Everyone and Move for Pressure Ulcer Prevention (TEAM-UP) cluster randomized trial. Movements and Braden Mobility and Activity subscale scores were evaluated for significant differences and associations. Mobility subgroups explained a small-medium amount of variance in mean lying and upright movement features (0.002 \u2264  \u2264 0.195). Activity subgroups explained a small-medium amount of variance in mean lying, upright, and ambulating movements (0.016 \u2264  \u2264 0.248). Significant associations occurred among subscale subgroups and most movements. Nursing assessment ratings using Braden scale's Mobility and Activity subscale scores are accurate indicators of actual repositioning movements and can be relied upon for PrI prevention care planning for older adults.",
