        "Description/Abstract": "Procedure, when discussed in regards to rhetoric, is framed overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, in regards to game play (and to video games most frequently). We argue that this view needs to be expanded if we are to realize how complex human-computer rhetor systems function rhetorically in diverse contexts. Such systems do so algorithmically through procedural enthymemes, which persuade audience agents to action through the apparent logic of a given system. Procedural persuasion occurs most often via strategies that facilitate the agent to assume an active role in \u201cself-persuasion\u201d in order to complete a given enthymeme. In this text, we explore the procedural enthymeme as a rhetorical tactic for human and nonhuman persuasion by looking at three case studies of commonly used technological \u201cmatching\u201d systems\u2014search engines (Google), online matchmaking (Match.com), and social networking (Facebook)\u2014that employ procedural enthymemes through their algorithms in order to persuade users toward particular engagements with those systems.",
