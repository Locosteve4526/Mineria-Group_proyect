        "Description/Abstract": "This study addresses the degree to which three selection factors (parent personality, depression, and coparent support) drive movement into neighborhoods and predict changes in youth externalizing behavior. Two studies followed children from birth to age 15 ( = 1,364 for Study 1; = 4,898 for Study 2). Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage, family income, and youth externalizing behavior were consistently and significantly correlated cross sectionally and longitudinally. Selection factors predicted changes in youth externalizing behavior. Higher family income, mother agreeableness, and perceived support from a coparent predicted movement over time into less disadvantaged neighborhoods. Lower levels of mother impulsivity, neuroticism, and depression also predicted movement over time into less disadvantaged neighborhoods. Neighborhood disadvantage did not predict change in youth externalizing behavior when any of the above selection factors were included in the model.
