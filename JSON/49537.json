        "Description/Abstract": "Stalking is a terrifying crime that can be difficult to investigate and prosecute. Previous studies have found that officers have a limited understanding and capacity to respond to stalking. As a result, stalking is often overlooked and/or minimized by criminal justice officials, particularly when it occurs within the context of domestic violence. To date, however, few studies have examined the nature and scope of police responses to stalking using official data. The current study analyzed four years of stalking data (2014 \u2013 2017) obtained from a midsize police department in a northwestern state. Findings will relate to the nature and scope of stalking cases, as well information related to officer decision-making. Implications and avenues for future research will be discussed.",
