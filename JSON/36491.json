        "Description/Abstract": "The Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) is an open-country, ground-nesting species found in marshes, grasslands, shrublands, and tundra across North America and around the world. Evidence suggests that Short-eared Owl populations are experiencing long-term, range-wide, substantial declines in North America, but sufficient monitoring data is lacking to quantify any possible trend. Complicating trend analysis efforts for this species are its rarity on the landscape, the broad geographic range it occupies, the narrow time window of efficient detection, and the expected annual variation in breeding densities. These factors speak to the need for a large distributed survey team to adequately assess this species. We have engaged more than 400 citizen scientist and professional volunteers across four states in western North America to assess the distribution, habitat use, population trend, and future viability of the Short-eared Owl within the region. In addition to exceeding our core population assessment objectives, the project has led to unexpected citizen led projects and collaborations, speaking to the strength of our citizen engagement approach. We present a summary of our approach, address the strengths and challenges, emphasize why we believe we have been successful, and highlight some of the unexpected project extensions.",
