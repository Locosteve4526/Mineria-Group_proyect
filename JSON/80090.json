        "Description/Abstract": "Cellular responses rely on effective sensing and intra-cellular transduction of environmental information. This information is either coded in the extracellular matrix as growth factors or activated by mechanosensitive signaling cascades through dynamic environmental force gradients. The nucleus, central to cellular activity, relies on both direct mechanical input as well as its molecular transducers to sense external stimuli and respond by regulating intra-nuclear chromatin organization that determines cell function and fate. In mesenchymal stem cells of musculoskeletal tissues, changes in nuclear structures are emerging as a key modulator of their differentiation and proliferation programs. While significant advances were made in the understanding of nuclear structure and gene expression separately, studying the nuclear mechanics and gene transcription in tandem has been challenging. In this review we will first discuss the current literature on how nuclear structure and signaling are altered in relation to environmental and tissue level mechanical cues. We will focus on state-of-the-art methods that can measure nuclear structure and mechanics of living nuclei with a particular emphasis on the methodologies that can be used in conjunction to visualize DNA and RNA dynamics in live cells in response to various forms of mechanical stimulation.",
