        "Description/Abstract": "As the refugee population continues to increase, the Trump administration continues to slash resettlement admissions framing refugees as a security threat. Education is a fundamental human right, and it is the best avenue for self-reliance. This paper explores how refugee students conform to, and persist schooling. Using Critical Race Theory as a framework, evidence of \u201csticky mess\u201d or racial inequalities (Espinoza and Harris, 1997) was shown to impact the lives of all participants. However, the strength of community cultural wealth (Yosso, 2005) assuaged the negative didactic experiences. Analysis of the dialogic semi-structured interviews that compromised the data set focused on the refugees\u2019 lives and educational experiences in their journey to the U.S.",
