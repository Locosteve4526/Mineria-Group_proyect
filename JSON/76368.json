        "Description/Abstract": "We study how firms change their risk-taking behavior after an exogenous credit rating upgrade. By taking advantage of the unique structure of bank holding companies, we find that subsidiary banks increase their mortgage loan denial rates after the parent\u2019s credit rating upgrade, and this increase is more pronounced for both riskier loan applications and in local markets with reduced competition. We rule out the alternative explanation that subsidiary banks move into riskier non-mortgage assets post-upgrade. Our results suggest firms change their business behavior to maintain their optimal credit rating for long-term benefits instead of exploiting the rating for short-term gains.",
