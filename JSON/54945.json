        "Description/Abstract": "This session describes a process of learner analysis using design thinking to create personas through empathetic questioning and readily available data. The personas then drive evidence-based learning design decisions. This approach will be contrasted to traditional approaches in terms of its scalability, affordability, sponsorship, and perspective.  We share completed personas, explain how they\u2019ve helped Boise State quickly adjust to 2020\u2019s disruptions, and guide participants in the process of building personas so that they can do the same in their workspaces. Learners will receive a template and question set for their own use.   ",
