        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;The events across the Three Body Problem trilogy paint a realist universe where Trisolaris and Earth are engaged in a complex deterrence game surrounded by unknown other actors in a dark forest. However, by examining the behavior of the wallfacers and the choices of sub-global actors, domestic political explanations become necessary to understand the choices of Earth. Finally, we conclude with the dangers of a realist frame of galactic politics and how such framing makes omnicide more, not less, likely.&lt;/span&gt;",
