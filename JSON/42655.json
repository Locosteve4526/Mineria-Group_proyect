        "Description/Abstract": "In this presentation Dr. Norm Friesen provides a short but broad history of the textbook as a \u201cmultimedia\u201d pedagogical and cultural form. In doing so, he situates the textbook in the context of changing instructional methods and practices, and demonstrates the importance of both oral and diagrammatic\u2014as well as textual\u2014forms of communication to this history. Friesen also argues that instructional forms and practices associated with the textbook have neither progressed along with new technologies nor gradually evolved as the psychological sciences have developed. Instead, he shows how these forms and practices have changed in general synchrony with larger cultural and epistemological developments.",
