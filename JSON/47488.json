        "Description/Abstract": "This panel proposes to initiate a dialogue by focusing specifically on how representatives from these different nations define education, and how they understand their disciplines as having access to it. \u201cIn the English-speaking world,\u201d as Gert Biesta has pointed out, education is understood as largely designating the world of formal learning (i.e. in schools, universities and other institutions). This in turn, is then \u201cseen as a \u2018field\u2019 or \u2018object\u2019 of study and it is argued that in order to study this field of object we need input from a range of (proper) academic disciplines, most notably the psychology, history, sociology and philosophy of education.\u201d Of course, words like utdanning (Norwegian) opleiding (Dutch) or Erziehung (German) designates both institutional education and that \u201ceducation\u201d that occurs through upbringing and non-specialized forms of engagement between adults and children. However, as Biesta emphasizes, what unifies this rather broad spectrum of activities for scholars working in these languages is \u201ca distinctive educational concern that provides a particular way of looking at and engaging with educational phenomena.\u201d To borrow from Schleiermacher, this interest is one that is defined by our answer to the question: \u201cWhat do [we] the older generation actually want from the younger.\u201d",
