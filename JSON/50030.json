        "Description/Abstract": "The adaptive potential of migratory birds to respond to\nseasonal changes driven by climate change likely depends\non variation in genes that influence the timing of events in\nthe annual cycle, such as migration. American Kestrels\n(Falco sparverius) from genetically distinct populations\nhave responded differently to climate change over the\npast 30 years. In western North America, kestrels show\nshorter migration distances associated with warmer\nwinters. However, in eastern North America, there are no\nsignificant changes in Kestrel migration distances. We\nexamined spatial patterns of candidate gene variants to\ndetermine whether there is a genetic basis for this\ndifference. We identified variants in previously identified\ncandidate genes involved in migration and circadian\nrhythm pathways and gene-climate associations using\nsequence data from 287 Kestrels sampled across North\nAmerica. Next, we designed a single nucleotide\npolymorphism (SNP) assay to genotype Kestrels and\nscreened 764 breeding American Kestrels. We found a\nlongitudinal cline in allele frequencies of SMAD2, a gene\nassociated with the circadian entrainment super pathway.\nPreliminary results support the hypothesis that the genetic\ncomposition of populations plays an important role in\nfacilitating adaptation to climate.
