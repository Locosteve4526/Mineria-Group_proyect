        "Description/Abstract": "Canadian Courts: Law, Politics and Process is the first and only Canadian text to specifically address the relationship between law and politics. Students will benefit from the broad, balanced portrait of the actors and institutions involved in Canada's judicial process provided by this core text. Taking a cross-cultural, comparative approach, the authors showcase Canada's legal system by illustrating the ways it differs and agrees with other systems worldwide. Each chapter features engaging case studies that encourage students to apply the concepts, theories, and critiques developed in the text. Comprehensive and accessible, Canadian Courts is simply the most up-to-date and relevant book available on the Canadian judicial process.",
