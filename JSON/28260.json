        "Description/Abstract": "In 2015, the President of the Associate for Information Systems introduced the Bright ICT Initiative (Lee 2015), which provides a framework for improving Internet security based on four principles: origin responsibility, deliverer responsibility, rule-based digital search warrants, and traceable anonymity. We review these principles and show that at least three of these principles are at odds with the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the founding principles of the Internet and may actually decrease individual security. We conclude giving suggestions for developing principles more in line with human rights.\n",
