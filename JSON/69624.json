        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;&quot;One must assume we are all familiar with what is commonly called \u2018education.\u2019&quot; This is how Schleiermacher begins his famous 1826 lecture on the\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Art of Education&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But in proceeding further\u2015and unlike Rousseau or Locke before him\u2015Schleiermacher carefully avoids assuming that education is primarily about a return to nature or about &quot;soundness&quot; of mind and body. Education is instead an ethical and political undertaking and a pragmatic art whose ultimate object and morality has differed greatly over time. It is exercised as a form of practical influence of the older generation on the younger: &quot;A significant part of the activity of the older generation extends toward the younger,&quot; Schleiermacher reasons, and it &quot;is more complete and perfect the more it is governed by an idea of what\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;should\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;happen\u2015the more it has an exemplar to guide its action\u2015the more it is an\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;art&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book offers these and other insights on education\u2015long canonical in Central and Northern Europe\u2015for the first time to an English audience. It also provides five chapters by scholars in education and its history that discuss various aspects of Schleiermacher\u2019s lecture.&lt;/span&gt;",
