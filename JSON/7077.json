        "Description/Abstract": "From the perspective of the individual human being, love and sex are certainly distinct phenomena (although a happy concomitance is often observed) that can be, and often are, pursued independently of one another. Taking a broad species approach rather than an individual one, the human sciences appear to be coalescing around the position that love is an epiphenomenon of sex, a position exemplified by the statement that &quot;Love is a snare set by sex to ensure the survival of the species.&quot;1 While I agree with the general thrust of this proposition, I view love as being much more than a simple derivative of sex. Love springs from sex, and thus shares with it a certain oneness of essence; but love pursues an independent existence, and in doing so elevates and ennobles that from which it sprang.",
