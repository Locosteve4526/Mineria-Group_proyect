Hunt Idaho\u2019s Minidoka War Relocation Center opened in August 1942. Dr. Robert C. Sims was devoted to research, writing, and education related to this unjust World War incarceration. Topics include Idaho Governor Chase Clark\u2019s role in the removal decision, life in camp, the impact of Japanese labor on Idaho\u2019s sugar beet and potato harvests, the effects of loyalty questionnaires, and more.
