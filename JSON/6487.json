        "Description/Abstract": "Located in the broader framework of the American West, the Intermountain West faces an uncertain environmental future defined by a unique dilemma sometimes described as a conflict between developers and environmentalists (Kamieniecki, Cahn, and Goss 1991, 482). The dilemma lies in the fact that the westerners would like to retain the majesty and beauty of their natural environment but at the same time they would like to foster an economy based on activities that are relatively detrimental to the area's environmental heritage--tourism, agriculture, logging, and mining. Thomas (1991) and Nash and Etulian (1989) postulate that the key to resolving this conflict may well be discovered by exploring the rural-urban linkages found in the Intermountain West.",
