        "Description/Abstract": "Opposition party position taking on conflict initiation is an important motivator for both formal models of war and in explaining the causal process of the democratic peace. Most notably, Shultz (1998; 2001) shows that the opposition party can serve as a powerful signal to adversaries about state resolve and intent. We argue that the model does not hold up to traditional understandings of opposition party behavior. Instead, we suggest that the opposition party\u2019s decision to support or oppose a war is a partly a function of election proximity. As an election nears, opposition parties have stronger incentives to support a budding conflict rather than oppose it. We test this hypothesis using force initiation votes in United States Senate and show that the staggered election cycle of the Senate produces different stimuli for legislators voting on the use of force.",
