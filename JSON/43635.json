        "Description/Abstract": "Job losses and unemployment experiences have been linked to negative health consequences for workers in the United States in many studies (Burgard, Brand, and House 2007; Gallo, Bradley, Dubin, Jones, Falba, Teng, and Kasl 2006; Gallo, Teng, Falba, Kasl, Krumholz, and Bradley 2006; Kessler, Turner, and House 1989; Turner 1995). Our hypothesis is that the job losses due to automation and increasing levels of perceived job insecurity in manufacturing in these areas is a significant factor in opioids abuse.  In this paper, we also examine the racial disparities in opioids use and the factors that are driving the difference.",
