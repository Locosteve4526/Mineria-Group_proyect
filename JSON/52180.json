        "Description/Abstract": "In the rationalist tradition, asymmetric intrastate conflict should not occur as the outcome is obvious ex ante and states can achieve a better bargain instead of paying the costs of war. However, asymmetric inter-state conflict does occur. This incongruity suggests a double-information problem regarding the intent, resolve, and capability of both minor and major powers in dispute. This manuscript suggests that large U.S. troop deployments create a unique solution to this problem by bridging information gaps for both states that have similar and dissimilar interests thereby provoking fewer opportunities for conflict. This paper combines research on asymmetric conflict, extended deterrence, and troop deployments to ascertain how U.S. security commitments affect conflict initiation in asymmetric relationships.",
