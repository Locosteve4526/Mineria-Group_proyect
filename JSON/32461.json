        "Description/Abstract": "Concrete pavement is under accelerated deterioration due to natural service environment and rapidly increasing heavy traffic. This article presents a numerical study for the analysis of the thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of concrete with Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) around individual aggregate. Attention was given to the simulation of concrete having different phases such as, cement paste, aggregate and particularly the ITZ surrounding the aggregates. All the boundary loads and temperatures were static to keep the simulation as simple as possible. A parametric study was conducted to observe the variation of deformations and stresses depending on the variation of the porosity of ITZ. It was found that deformation of concrete depends on the variation of temperature as well as the porosity of ITZ. Two different failure functions were used to evaluate the potential failure location. Both of the failure functions agree with the identified failure locations.",
