        "Description/Abstract": "For centuries, pedagogy has neither been primarily concerned with school and curricula, nor with the techniques and politics of teaching. The meaning of pedagogy (or \u201cpedagogics\u201d), in other words, is broader than formal education, constructivist or instructivist pedagogies or even a pedagogy of the oppressed. Pedagogy instead begins by acknowledging the influence that is exercised by one person or group (i.e. the educator) on another (i.e. the educand), and the fact that this influence exists in special relation to the world.",
