        "Description/Abstract": "Using an established Ross/Macdonald model variant for mosquito-born parasite\ntransmission, we extend the formalism to simply incorporate time-dependent\ncontrol measures. In particular, two interventions are considered, mass drug\nadministration (MDA) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), whose individual\nintensities during their respective campaigns are set to the same\nintervention-reduced reproductive number $R_0$. The impacts of these\ninterventions, measured as each campaign's ability over time to reduce\ninfections in a community, are found based on the transmission setting,\ncoverage, and their associated durations. These impacts are compared for both\ninterventions and their joint deployment. Synchronous campaigns of IRS deployed\nwith MDA have a cooperative, synergistic effect whose impact exceeds that when\nthe campaigns are deployed in isolation. Simulations with \\emph{openmalaria},\nwith its more complex model of transmission, are separately performed and show\na similar impact enhancement with these interventions. A new, associated\nanalysis yields simple scaling relationships that estimate the dynamical\nresurgence time, post-intervention, to disease proliferation in a community.\n\n",
