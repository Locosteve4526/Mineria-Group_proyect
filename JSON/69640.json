Facilitators will share their experiences of working with 4 MBA programs that were viewed as having major AACSB issues to having \u201cgold star\u201d reviews in under 2 years. Participants will be encouraged to tell their own AOL improvement stories to generate themes that could be embraced by future AOL change agents. The themes identified by the group will focus on the most important factors in creating effective change to accreditation processes in order to not only meet but exceed expectations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
