        "Description/Abstract": "Scientists have developed evidence-based interventions that improve the symptoms and functioning of youth with psychiatric disorders; however, these interventions are rarely used in community settings. Eliminating this research-to-practice gap is the purview of implementation science, the discipline devoted to the study of methods to promote the use of evidence-based practices in routine care.",
