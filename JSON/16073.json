        "Description/Abstract": "Bacteria communicate using small molecules called autoinducers that include acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) and autoinducer peptides (AIP) to estimate local population density, commonly referred to as quorum sensing. Acyl homoserine lactone dependent quorum sensing is prevalent in 68 (26%) of the 265 sequenced proteobacteria today; some of which are extremely virulent including plant pathogen Pantoea Stewartii, which causes leaf blight and plant death in sweet corn and maize.  These bacteria are known to use quorum sensing for the regulation of functions such as formation of biofilms, exopolysaccharides and production of toxins.  AHL\u2019s are synthesized inside the bacterium by AHL synthases called as \u2018I\u2019 proteins, which are recognized by \u2018R\u2019 proteins to initiate a signaling cascade that leads to two-way communication among bacteria. The synthesis of AHL\u2019s in Pantoea Stewartii is the product of a bisubstrate reaction involving 3-oxohexanoyl acyl carrier protein and S-adenosyl-L-methionine substrates, catalyzed by the EsaI AHL synthase.  This reaction releases 3-oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone (AHL), holo-ACP and 5?-Methylthioadenosine (MTA), which is a substrate for 5\u2019-Methylthioadenosine/S-Adenosylhomocysteine Nucleosidase (MTN).  We have developed a coupled assay for EsaI in the presence of saturating concentrations (MTN) to monitor EsaI reaction rates via changes in absorbance at 275 nm resulting from the MTN dependent depurination of adenosine in MTA.  Confirmation of the accuracy of this assay has been demonstrated in the comparison to a previously described colorimetric assay using Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP).  This novel assay overcomes the shortcomings of the DCPIP assay such as, non-specific reduction by contaminants, and can be applied to assay any member of LuxI family of AHL synthases. This information will aid in the development of species-specific quorum sensing inhibitors for bacteria utilizing AHL signaling in quorum sensing.   ",
