        "Description/Abstract": "This study investigates how Latina/Latino youth resist, conform to, and persist in schooling, and explores their preparation for an education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. Using Latino Critical Race Theory as a framework, evidence of the \u201csticky mess\u201d of racial inequalities (Espinoza and Harris in Calif Law Rev 10:499\u2013559, 1997) and the concept of community cultural wealth (Yosso in Race Ethn Educ 8:69\u201391, 2005) will be used to understand how Latina/o students successfully persist in college. Quantitative and qualitative findings collected at two public universities in 2007\u20132012 show that Latina/o parents play a significant role in influencing their children\u2019s decision to attend college; family, friend and community support and hard work have also been instrumental in college success. This is evident through parents\u2019 encouragement to persist, expectations to do well and students serving as role models for siblings and peers. As policy makers in the educational arena emphasize STEM fields, there is a significant opportunity for Latino students to make valuable contributions.",
