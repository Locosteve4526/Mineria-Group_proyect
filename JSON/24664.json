        "Description/Abstract": "McLuhan\u2019s concern with the economy of the senses is familiar to media studies, as is his emphasis on their relation to different media and the transitions between them. It follows that it should not be difficult to combine McLuhan\u2019s notion of a sensory economy together with an analysis of a media-system\u2019s functions \u2013and in principle at least, to ground a science of media (Medienwissenschaft) on that basis. But such an undertaking has yet to be ventured, and the fertile ground presented by the senses for media theory lies conspicuously fallow. This paper explores why this is the case, and considers what might be gained or lost through different approaches to McLuhan\u2019s work and to media studies themselves.",
