        "Description/Abstract": "We tested a prototype capacitive-conductivity borehole tool in a shallow, unconfined aquifer with coarse, unconsolidated sediments and very-low-conductivity water at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS). Examining such a high-resistivity system provides a good test for the capacitive- conductivity tool because the conventional induction- conductivity tool (known to have limited effectiveness in high-resistivity systems) did not generate expressive well logs at the BHRS. The capacitive-conductivity tool demonstrated highly repeatable, low-noise behavior but poor correlation with the induction tool in the lower-conductivity portions of the stratigraphy where the induction tool was relatively unresponsive. Singular spectrum analysis of capacitive- conductivity logs reveals similar vertical-length scales of structures to porosity logs at the BHRS. Also, major stratigraphic units identified with porosity logs are evident in the capacitive-conductivity logs. However, a previously unrecognized subdivision in the upper portion of one of the major stratigraphic units can be identified consistently as a relatively low-conductivity body (i.e., an electrostratigraphic unit) between the overlying stratigraphic unit and the relatively high-conductivity lower portion \u2014 despite similar porosity and lithology in adjacent units. The high repeatability and resolution and the wide dynamic range of the capacitive-conductivity tool are demonstrated here to extend to high-resistivity, unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer environments.",
