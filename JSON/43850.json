For 2018 we will feature Adam Teller's &quot;Money, Power, and Influence in Eighteenth-Century Lithuania: The Jews on the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Estates.&quot; The book examines how Jews achieved an extraordinary success within the late feudal economy of the eighteenth-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth thanks to an identification and exploitation of economic niches in the pre-modern economy.",
