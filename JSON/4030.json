        "Description/Abstract": "University students (N=433) were surveyed about their satisfaction with a number of campus services and opportunities. Comparisons between traditional (up to 24 years old) and nontraditional (25 years and up) students indicated the latter valued learning and school opportunities more and appreciated the efforts of their professors in interacting with them and communicating information. A number of similarities were noted. University administrations need to be aware of the important differences between such groups to be able to enhance students' safisfaction.",
