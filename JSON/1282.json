        "Description/Abstract": "If you are a frequent reader of Eye on Psi Chi, you already  know the importance of the undergraduate research experience for  students planning to attend graduate school. The importance of this  experience has been chronicled not only in the literature (Keith-  Spiegel, 1991; Keith-Spiegel &amp; Wiederman, 2000; Landrum &amp; Clark,  2005; Landrum, Jeglum, &amp; Cashin, 1994), but also in the pages of Eye  on Psi Chi (Kaiser, Kaiser, Richardson, &amp; Fox, 2007; Slattery  &amp; Park, 2002; Sleigh &amp; Ritzer, 2007). The tasks of the  undergraduate research assistant have also been defined in numerous  articles. Some of these articles include rankings of the importance of  tasks (Bauer &amp; Bennett, 2003; Kaiser, et al., 2007; Kardash, 2000;  Landrum &amp; Nelsen, 2002), and other articles provide general  information on the tasks to be performed by undergraduate research  assistants (Sleigh &amp; Ritzer, 2007). It is clear from the data that  different faculty may have different expectations for undergraduates  involved in research. What are the specific expectations that faculty  members have for their undergraduate researchers? Do faculty members  communicate these expectations, and do these expectations form the basis  of evaluative criteria for the undergraduate research experience?",
