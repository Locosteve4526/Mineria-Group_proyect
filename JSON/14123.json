        "Description/Abstract": "This research focuses on categorizing and synthesizing models and frameworks targeted on mobile learning. Seventeen papers were reviewed, and the models or frameworks were divided into five categories and discussed: 1) pedagogies and learning environment design; 2) platform/system design; 3) technology acceptance; (4) evaluation; and 5) psychological construct. The categorization and analysis can help inform evaluation, design, and development of curriculum and environments for meaningful mobile learning experiences for learners of various demographics.",
