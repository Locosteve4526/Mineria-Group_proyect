        "Description/Abstract": "This article presents an overview of how the internet has changed the way employers advertise vacancies and the way technical communicators search and apply for these openings. First, I explore the evolution of how employers have used the internet as a tool for identifying the best candidate for the job. Next, I review seven specific online recruiting strategies used by employers today. Finally, I describe major mistakes made by online job seekers and offer advice on how best to avoid or minimize these blunders. Included is a list of useful job search resources for technical communicators.",
