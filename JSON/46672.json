        "Description/Abstract": "Data-driven models explaining structure-property relationships in engineering systems can significantly reduce development time. Additionally, these models help to mitigate material costs by eliminating unnecessary use of raw materials in nonviable material systems. There are a few such models for perovskite systems, but none for those containing trigonal distortions or oxygen vacancies. In this study, structural data for five trigonally distorted perovskite systems were mined from literature, and a correlative relationship between the trigonality and the tolerance factor was derived. The general equation predicts the potential trigonality of a given perovskite system at room temperature and pressure using only ionic radii data. As intrinsic polarization is directly related to these distortions, it may be possible to predict that as well.",
