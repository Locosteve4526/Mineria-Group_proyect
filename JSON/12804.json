        "Description/Abstract": "The purpose of this activity is to describe the lived experience of pre-nursing students in a Holistic Nursing course prior to admission into the academic nursing program as a catalyst for personal change.  &quot;Holistic Nursing Care&quot; is an elective course offering an opportunity for pre-nursing students to begin their education with early exposure to nursing concepts from a holistic perspective. Taking this course early in the curriculum promotes holistic change within the pre-nursing student by spreading the interest in complementary and alternative therapies (CAT). Through personal testimony, pre-nursing students who complete this course discover the course as a stepping stone to realizing their dream of becoming a compassionate and attentive nurse and health care provider.",
