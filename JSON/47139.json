        "Description/Abstract": "First and second authors are undergraduate Sociology students employed as Research Assistants in this project.\n\nThrough a five-year longitudinal NSF-funded project to `Revolutionize Engineering and Computer Science Departments,` the Computer Science Professionals` Hatchery (CSP-Hatchery) at Boise State University (BSU) aims to improve attitudes and behaviors facilitating inclusion, diversity &amp; social justice among CS students. During its first two years, this research identified and described actors and processes contributing to forces perpetuating biases within CS education. Through surveys, analysis of curricula, and a longitudinal series of interviews with undergraduate CS students, we verify the `typical` CS student`s role in normalizing the lack of gender, race and ethnic diversity in CS. While many consider the climate of the department welcoming and inclusive, interviewees` elaborative statements essentialize gender differences and reference Idaho`s small population of people of color. Reflecting an uncritical orientation to the relative absence of individuals representing underrepresented groups, the majority of CS students allow for the persistence of culturally hegemonic power structures which favor white male students. In addition, these students generally endorse a diversity ideology and form homogeneous peer networks that work together to further marginalize underrepresented populations. In this paper, we describe how these processes of covert exclusion operate and explicate them in terms of cultural and feminist sociological theory.",
