        "Description/Abstract": "Traditional libraries have invested much of their energy in maintaining distinct boundaries between various library departments and, similarly, between physical building spaces intended for different purposes. During the past twenty years, these boundaries have begun to dissolve as libraries have embraced the concept of &quot;seamless learning,&quot; which demands the creation of holistic spaces that combine research, technology, and other student services. The quest for seamless learning has also led to the development of innovative collaborations across campus with the goal of increasing overall student success, which is a central concern of both academic libraries and student affairs. This annotated bibliography provides a selected collection of resources on the subject of the learning commons (LC) in academic libraries, focusing on three areas: the evolution of the concept, the partnership model, and the administrative logistics of the LC.",
