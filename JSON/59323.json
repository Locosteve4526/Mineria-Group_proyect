        "Description/Abstract": "We describe a case of a 2 year old female given a full course of Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine (DP) dosed at a tablet of 320/40mg per day for 3 days during a mass treatment campaign in Uganda. This child was not taking any other medications prior to DP ingestion. She developed a progressive skin rash and blisters which later formed painful raw areas associated with a low grade fever 7 days after DP ingestion. Blood work performed (CBC, RFTs/LFTs) was basically unremarkable apart from hypoproteinemia of 4.63(6.6-8.7 g/dl). Her constellation of symptoms and presentation were consistent with Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (&gt;30% TBSA). The causality was established as \u2018probable\u2019 to DP with both Naranjo scale and World Health Organization causality assessment scale. It could not be established whether the offending molecule was dihydroartemisinin or piperaquine but the child had previously taken artemether-lumefantrine for malaria with no reported complaints. The child was admitted to the burns unit, and managed basically with supportive treatment which included: steroids, anti-histamines, tetracycline ointment for eye care, prophylactic antibiotics, twice daily dressing with neomycin cream and plenty of fluids and high protein diet until she was discharged after 2 weeks. The child was monitored for re-appearance of lesions for up to 6 months but none were observed. The child and her caregivers were given a laminated card to be used at all health facilities, advising against any retreatment with DP.",
