        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The global Anglican Communion--the third largest Christian denomination worldwide-- began discussions of LGBTQ+ issues in the 1970s. Why, after fifty years, are these issues still undecided? Media reports of splits among bishops, homophobia, post-colonial bigotry, and global schism polarize believers. This article provides historical and theological analysis into the global Anglican Communion\u2019s lack of unity on these issues, with an emphasis on the Communion\u2019s long-standing tradition of the &lt;em&gt;via media, &lt;/em&gt;or \u201cmiddle way,\u201d as a way to understand the complex path the Anglican Communion is traversing.&lt;/p&gt;",
