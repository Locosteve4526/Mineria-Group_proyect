        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Women's collegiate basketball is a fast-growing, dynamic sport that spans 8 or more months, with athletes competing in 30\u2009+\u2009games in a season. The aim of this study was to quantify and profile the external load of practices and games during a Power-5 DI Women's Collegiate Basketball season. Specifically, Average PlayerLoad (PL), PlayerLoad per minute (PL*min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\u22121&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;), High Inertial Movement Analysis (High-IMA), and Jumps were quantified using Catapult Openfield software during four distinct training periods of the year: 8-hour preseason, 20-hour preseason, non-conference, and conference game play. Weekly variations and acute to chronic workload ratios (ACWR) were also examined. Eleven subjects participated in daily external load monitoring during practice and games\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;via&lt;span&gt;\u00a0Catapult's ClearSky T6 inertial measurement units (IMU). Averages, standard deviations, and confidence intervals were calculated for training period comparisons, and Cohen's\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span&gt;\u00a0was calculated as a measure of effect size. Findings include normative values to provide context for the demands experienced across an entire season. PL was significantly higher during non-conference play than during any of the other three training periods (&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span&gt;\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Descriptive data enumerate percent change and ACRW variations throughout the season. These data can be used to describe the physical demands across a season and provide physical profile guidelines for coaches.&lt;/span&gt;",
