        "Description/Abstract": "Moral teaching has been studied in terms of a wide range of frameworks and terms, including teacher ethical reasoning, teacher authenticity as well as teacher disposition and teacher manner. For example, drawing from Aristotelian and Arendtian sources (respectively), scholars have defined teacher manner as \u201cconduct expressive of dispositions or traits\u201d associated with \u201cvirtue\u201d and teacher authenticity as the unity of \u201cteachers\u2019 personal and professional selves.\u201d This paper proposes the adaptation of two rather different frameworks or heuristics from the continental pedagogical tradition to a similar end: Namely to show how \u201cpedagogical tact\u201d (p\u00e4dagogischer Takt) and the \u201cpedagogical triangle\u201d (didaktischer Dreieck; Triangle p\u00e9dagogique) can be used as analytical, heuristic devices to help bring aspects of moral teaching to visibility.",
