        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Research in criminology and criminal justice has generally focused on men, placing them as the focus of research on explanations of criminal behavior and best practices for rehabilitative efforts. Growth in the body of research focusing on justice-involved women has occurred over the past few decades, yielding promising findings for a more gender-responsive approach to understanding the etiology of criminal behavior among women and by proxy, best practices for rehabilitative efforts. This body of work has revealed that victimization, trauma, mental illness, and substance abuse are all important factors to consider when working with justice-involved women. While this growth has occurred among general justice-involved women, less focus has been paid to women who have committed sexual offenses. Studies point to similarities between general justice-involved women and women who have sexually offended, specifically regarding victimization, trauma, and mental illness. The current study explores the impact trauma and victimization have on mental illness and criminality in a sample of women convicted of a sexual offense in the State of Texas. Results provide implications for treatment and supervision needs for this understudied population.&lt;/span&gt;",
