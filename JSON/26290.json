        "Description/Abstract": "This article examines intentional ambiguities of identity in four of Strubel\u2019s novels: Offene Blende (2001, Open Shutter), Snowed Under (2008, Unter Schnee, 2001), Tupolew 134 (2004, Tupolev 134), and K\u00e4ltere Schichten der Luft (2007, Colder Layers of Air).  Strubel\u2019s characters fight prescribed roles, travel in search of exits and loopholes and take on different identities. Strubel plays with uncertainties in these characters to expose fractures in societal norms and traditions and to disrupt society\u2019s habitual ways of thinking about identity. Through these various ambiguities she intentionally disrupts the realistic parameters she has set for her texts.",
