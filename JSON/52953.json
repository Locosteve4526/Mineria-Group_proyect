        "Description/Abstract": "From the printing press to personalized learning, new pedagogies and technologies, each in their time, have been configured in remarkably similar ways in educational discourse: they are seen as overcoming political compromises, human failings, even the \u2018dark\u2019 ways of the past; and they are regarded as ushering in a kind of pedagogical utopia of natural, authentic, even playful teaching and learning. This in turn gives the present a sense of urgency. It, in turn, is portrayed as a time when action, investment and change\u2014often unprecedented in scope and scale\u2014are all urgently needed. And just as the past is described in terms of its failings, brokenness and incompletion, the future is characterized by its totality, completion and finality. This pattern is considered first in historically through the example of Comenius and the printing press; next, it is examined in present-day guise: in discourses related to \u201cpersonalized learning\u201d and the algorithmic technologies enabling them.",
