        "Description/Abstract": "By introducing an electromagnetic field into the ground with either a steady\r\n\r\nelectric current or a time varying electromagnetic wave (ERT, GPR respec-\r\ntively), we can image the shallow subsurface by measuring the field response\r\n\r\nnear the air-ground interface and then inverting for subsurface properties using\r\n\r\nour forward models.\r\n\r\nBoth these methods are sensitive to electrical conductivity, although the elec-\r\ntric field response generated by GPR is most sensitive to high frequency con-\r\nductivity, while the response given by ERT is most sensitive to low frequency\r\n\r\nconductivity.\r\n\r\nAccurate computational tools for modeling these electromagnetic fields in our\r\n\r\nphysical region of interest can then be used for a joint inversion by regularizing\r\n\r\nboth (conductivity complimentary) data sets.\r\n\r\nWe develop two dimensional forward models for GPR and ERT in theory and\r\n\r\ncomputationally using finite difference time domain and finite volume method\r\n\r\nrespectively, together with numerical results from synthetically produced data.\r\n\r\nWe also develop novel theoretical approaches for a joint inversion using GPR\r\n\r\nand ERT data.",
