        "Description/Abstract": "This study defines the hydrostratigraphy of\na portion of the upper Orella Member (and\nperhaps lowermost Whitney Member) of the\nBrule Formation, an Oligocene siltstone that\nis used as an aquifer where wells intercept\nzones of secondary permeability. Drilling experience,\nlithologic logs of core, and borehole\ngeophysical logs indicate that the portion of\nthe Brule Formation which we studied (1)\nconsists of siltstone with thin claystone and\nsandstone layers, (2) includes numerous paleosols,\n(3) includes distributed secondary\npermeability features such as pedotubules\nand parting planes, and (4) includes a subhorizontal\nzone (average thickness, 2.3 m) of\nintensely fractured siltstone that can be traced\nas a hydrostratigraphic unit across the western\nportion of the study site.\nHorizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity\n(Kr, Kz) measurements on core samples\nwhich do not exhibit secondary permeability\nfeatures generally are similar and fall within\nexpected ranges. Measurements of horizontal\nhydraulic conductivity from single-well injection\ntests in relatively unfractured intervals\nwithin the Brule Formation have a narrow\nrange. Log mean Kr of predominantly siltstone\nintervals from single-well tests (Kr\n-10- 6 m/s) is an order of magnitude greater\nthan log mean Kr measurements on core siltstones\n(Kr ~10~7 m/s); this difference is\nattributed to distributed secondary permeability\nfeatures noted in core. The subhorizontal\nzone of fractured siltstone is interpreted to be\na highly conductive hydrostratigraphic unit\nwithin the relatively impermeable Brule\nFormation.",
