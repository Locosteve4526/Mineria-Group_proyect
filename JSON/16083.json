        "Description/Abstract": "Salmonella outbreaks are analyzed for genetic similarity in order to track the origin and the modes of transmission of isolates from related strains. The population study needs an accurate and reliable method that can be efficiently replicated to analyze the proteome of the isolates. This project is focused on finding the optimized conditions for complete resolution for the separation of the proteins in the isolates using 2-D gel electrophoresis.  The gradient of pH and acrylamide concentrations was adjusted to find the recipe for separation of the Salmonella typhimurium proteome. The data generated by 2D-gel electrophoresis method will be used to compare the proteomes from different S. typhimurium isolates.",
