        "Description/Abstract": "Carruthers argues that an integrated faculty of metarepresentation evolved for mindreading and was later exapted for metacognition. A more consistent application of his approach would regard metarepresentation in mindreading with the same skeptical rigor, concluding that the &quot;faculty&quot; may have been entirely exapted. Given this result, the usefulness of Carruthers' line-drawing exercise is called into question.",
