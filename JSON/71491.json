        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Recent changes in how scholars conceptualize necessity entrepreneurship have rendered the traditional, dichotomous, push-pull framework, which delineates between necessity and opportunity entrepreneurs, obsolete. We know that some individuals transition out of necessity entrepreneurship \u2013 indeed, this is an important and desirable outcome given that necessity entrepreneurship underperforms other forms of entrepreneurship on most key metrics \u2013 but the push-pull framework offers no theoretical pathway to explain such a move. We build on recent reconceptualization of the opportunity construct to describe the process by which an entrepreneur\u2019s underlying needs \u2013 basic, psychological, and self-fulfillment based \u2013 inform both the desired future state that they pursue, and their evaluation of the conditions necessary for them to take entrepreneurial action. In doing so we offer a process model that explains upward mobility among entrepreneurs, and suggest five outcomes to replace necessity and opportunity as entrepreneurial outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;",
