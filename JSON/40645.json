        "Description/Abstract": "During times of censorship, forced exile, and cultural persecution, individuals worked in the shadows and abroad to maintain and develop a culture on the verge of annihilation. It is worth remembering and acknowledging the fearless and impactful efforts of those who worked to promote the Basque Culture and language. Amongst the many, three female writers had a pivotal role in the maintenance and progress of Basque literature.  The efforts of Karmele Errazti, Sorne Unzueta, and Julene Azpeitia will be analyzed in order to remember and honor these female trailblazers of Basque literature during the 20th century",
