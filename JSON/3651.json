        "Description/Abstract": "The implementation, characterization, and evaluation of a low-cost infrasound sensor developed at the Infrasound Laboratory at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (Infra-NMT) are described. This sensor is based on a commercial micromachined piezoresistive differential pressure transducer that uses a mechanical high-pass filter to reject low-frequency outband energy. The sensor features a low-noise, 2.02-mPa rms (0.5\u20132 Hz), 5.47-mPa rms (0.1\u201320 Hz), or 5.62-mPa rms (0.05\u201320 Hz), flat response between 0.01 and at least 40 Hz; inband sensitivity of 45.13 6 0.23 mV Pa21; and a nominal linear range from 2124.5 to 1124.5 Pa. Intended for outdoor applications, the influence of thermal changes in the sensor\u2019s response has been minimized by using a thermal compensated pressure transducer powered by an ultralow drift (,5 ppm 8C21) and noise (,4mV from peak to peak) voltage reference. The sensor consumes a minimum of 24 mW and operates with voltages above 8 V while drawing 3 mA of current. The Infra-NMT specifications described above were independently verified using the infrasound test chamber at the Sandia National Laboratories\u2019 (SNL\u2019s) Facility for Acceptance, Calibration, and Testing (FACT), and the following pro- cedures are for comparison calibration against traceable reference stands in voltage and pressure. Because of the intended broad frequency response of this sensor, the testing chamber was configured in a double- reference sensor scheme. A well-characterized microbarometer (with a flat-amplitude response between 0.01 and 8 Hz) and a microphone (with a flat-amplitude response above 8 Hz) were used simultaneously in this double-reference test configuration.",
