        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;A Catholic, midwife, and writer, Elizabeth Cellier (&lt;em&gt;fl.&lt;/em&gt; 1678-1688) was one of the best-known Catholic women of seventeenth-century England. Cellier inserted her voice into the political, religious, and professional controversies of her day by authoring four texts in which she engaged subjects as varied as the torture of Catholic prisoners in London jails and the professionalization of women\u2019s midwifery. Provoking authority, Cellier was placed on trial for treason and libel, and she inspired almost thirty publications critical of her actions and ideas. Nonetheless, through her works and writings, she helped create new avenues for women, especially Catholic women, to express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;",
