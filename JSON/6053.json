        "Description/Abstract": "Metacomprehension accuracy is typically quite poor; however, recently interventions have been developed to improve accuracy. In two experiments, we evaluated whether generating delayed keywords prior to judging comprehension improved metacomprehension accuracy for children. For sixth and seventh graders, metacomprehension accuracy was greater for the delayed-keyword condition than for a control group. By contrast, for fourth graders, accuracy did not differ across conditions. Improved metacomprehension accuracy led to improved regulation of study.",
