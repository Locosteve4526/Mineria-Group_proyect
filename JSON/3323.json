        "Description/Abstract": "The article analyses the role of food in the novel \u00dcberbleibsel, by Jeanette Lander. It carefully considers the many-sided connections between food, memory, and intercultural experiences. The rules of Kashrut and its impact on the narrator's culinary practice are emphasized. It also examines the relationship between the narrator's two great passions which are cooking and writing, as well as the contradictions of her gourmet aspirations and weight-loss ambitions.\n?",
