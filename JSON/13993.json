        "Description/Abstract": "We plan to discuss mathematical constructions,\nnotably the definition of relations, functions,\nand cardinals, in the simple theory of types using\nonly three types. This is somewhat tricky\nbecause the usual definitions of the ordered\npair require at least 3 types to define a pair,\nand so 4 types before any implementation of\na relation or a function as a set of ordered\npairs is feasible. Nonetheless, quite a lot can\nbe done.",
