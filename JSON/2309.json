        "Description/Abstract": "The mathematics placement process at University of Northern Colorado includes brief faculty-student interviews during which faculty members suggest mathematics courses for students in their first year at the university. Data from a sample of 1466 students admitted in the fall of 2007 were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the placement interview. Logistic regression was used to model student success in the first university mathematics or statistics course as a function of the other available variables. The analysis indicated that, among the available variables, by far the most important factor in modeling success was high school grade point average. Whether or not the student followed the recommendation advice and recent (usually high school) mathematics course and grade were also useful variables for modeling success.",
