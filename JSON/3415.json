        "Description/Abstract": "Thirteen experienced Texas Department of Public Safety examiners participated in a study of the potential effects of pre-test breathing instructions on examiners\u2019 impressions of respiratory countermeasures and artifacts in the polygraph recordings. Data were obtained from 60 field examinations, where half included a pre-test breathing instruction. Judgments of both respiratory artifacts and countermeasures were found to have low reliability. Nevertheless, a significant and undesirable impact of instructions on the perceptions of both artifacts and countermeasures was observed. Breathing instructions resulted in a greater proportion of blind evaluator reports of artifacts and countermeasures. Field practices, assumptions, and policies pertaining to pre-test instructions about breathing during testing should be considered in light of these data. These results underscore the importance of evidence-based field practice policies, and the potential hazards associated with well-intended field practice policies derived in the absence of evidence.",
