        "Description/Abstract": "The perennial grasses switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.)\nand big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) are\npromising candidates for sustainable bioenergy production.\nHowever, land conversion for bioenergy production leads to\nsubstantial soil carbon (C) losses, and these must be repaid if\nthese bioenergy crops are to help curb rising atmospheric CO2\nconcentrations. We evaluated differences in soil C\naccumulation and the processes that affect it, under a variety\nof switchgrass and big bluestem cultivars. Our experiments\nare located at the Fermilab National Environmental Research\nPark, Batavia, Illinois, and at the Agricultural Research and\nDevelopment Center (ARDC), Ithaca, Nebraska. We found\nconsiderable within and between-species variability in soil C\naccumulation. Specific root length (SRL) differed\nsignificantly among the swithgrass cultivars with a five fold\ndifference between cultivars with the highest and lowest\naverage SRL. These differences were consistent across a\nrange of growing and drought stress conditions. SRL was a\ngood predictor of soil C input by switchgrass cultivars in the\nearly years of the experiments, however soil C accumulation\nin the later years appeared to be mediated by processes other\nthan the quantity of root C input. Our data revealed variation\nin rhizosphere metabolic profiles of switchgrass and big\nbluestem cultivars as well as in bulk soil microbial\ncommunites. Together, our data indicate that we might expect\ndifferences among species and cultivars in the chemical\ncomposition of root exudate input and microbial residue\nformation, which may explain variation among cultivars and\nspecies in soil C accumulation.",
