        "Description/Abstract": "Many states across the United States have significant rural populations, which typically &lt;br&gt;face different sets of challenges than those closer to urban populations. This is &lt;br&gt;particularly evident in the different types of opportunities that small businesses face in &lt;br&gt;those rural areas. In recent years, various efforts - both at a national and local level - have &lt;br&gt;been taken to increase those opportunities for rural small businesses. However, those &lt;br&gt;efforts have not always produced the results that are envisioned. Utilizing information &lt;br&gt;about Small Business Development Center (SBDC) strategies to serve small businesses in &lt;br&gt;both rural and urban areas, we highlight the efforts that work to aid rural entrepreneurs &lt;br&gt;as well as those that fall short.",
