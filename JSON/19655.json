        "Description/Abstract": "We examine how analysts\u2019 earnings forecast properties vary when accounting information is more difficult to process. Specifically, we investigate whether analysts\u2019 forecast properties are associated with real earnings management (REM). We hypothesize and find that analysts\u2019 forecasts are less accurate and more disperse for REM firms. Next, we investigate cross-sectional differences among REM firms based on the presence of management guidance. We find some evidence that management guidance reduces the association between REM and analysts\u2019 forecast error, and strong evidence that management guidance reduces the association between REM and dispersion. Finally, we investigate cross-sectional differences among REM firms based on their earnings management incentives. We find that firms without high earnings management incentives drive the association between REM and analysts\u2019 forecast error and dispersion. Our results are consistent across a variety of proxies for REM, such as abnormal cash flows from operations, abnormal SG&amp;A expense, abnormal production costs, as well as a combined measure. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to document a relation between REM and the properties of analysts\u2019 forecasts.",
