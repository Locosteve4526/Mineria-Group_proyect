        "Description/Abstract": "This breakout session will discuss the challenges and benefits of implementing Greene and Meissner's 'More Product Less Process.' What is your institution's policy? How did you implement an MPLP program? How has MPLP been incorporated/written into your processing manual, standards, etc.? What are some best practices? Are there certain standards always used? What does not work and why? How do you train students/interns/employees? How flexible are you \u2013 i.e., do you apply different methods to different series or try to be strictly consistent? Are there new ideas beyond Greene and Meissner? How does utilizing MPLP affect budget/funding?",
