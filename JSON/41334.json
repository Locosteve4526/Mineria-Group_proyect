First, it addresses teacher burnout in a way that honors\nteachers\u2019 lives and the stories that shape them. Second, it gives voice to teachers who are often\nvoiceless within the larger arena of public education. In conclusion, we aim to explore the role\nof memory, remembering and forgetting as key aspects in contributing to both the genesis of\nfeeling of burnout and frustration, as well as resolution of such feelings.",
