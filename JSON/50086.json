        "Description/Abstract": "Background: Cannabis has been cited as the most frequently used substance in this country and intolerance towards substance use is a recognized concern in nursing. The two-fold purpose of this descriptive study was to determine 1) what, if any, were the differences between nurses\u2019 attitudes of patient cannabis use in states in which cannabis was legal versus illegal , and 2) how do nurses working in diverse care settings differ in their attitudes regarding patient cannabis use. Methods : A sample of 809 registered nurses from across the United States were recruited to take part in this study in October 2018. A 20 question survey was used to collect participants\u2019 perceptions of and attitudes toward patient cannabis use. Demographic information collected included age, gender, educational level, years in practice, primary area of practice, and legal status of cannabis in state of practice. An independent t -test and ANOVA were used to analyze group differences. Findings: Findings from this study indicated that there was no significant difference in attitudes of nurses in states in which cannabis use was legal (M=28.76, SD=7.83) and states in which it was illegal (M=29.43, SD=7.65); t(807)=1.202, p=.230. Additionally, no significant differences were found in attitudes across six areas of practice (F(5)=1.531, p=.178). Furthermore, nursing attitudes were largely positive, (M= 29.04 (SD 7.762; range 20-100). Conclusions: Findings from this study indicate that cannabis use may not carry the same perceived stigma as other substances for nurses and unbiased care may be provided regardless of personal beliefs.",
