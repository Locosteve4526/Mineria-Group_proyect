        "Description/Abstract": "Education has experienced a recent shift in focus to strategies and methodologies centered around rapid deployment and accessible content. In response to the impacts of a global pandemic, there has been a significant transition from in-person content to virtual activities. While these online applications and virtual technologies are essential for our evolving education systems, an emphasis on application and experience is essential for knowledge transmission and transferable skills. This investigation focuses on renewing opportunities for small groups of students to engage in field experiences in science field courses while maintaining the requirements of social distancing to ensure safe and healthy interaction among students in an outdoor environment. One key strategy for strengthening scientific practice is by developing a curriculum that includes real-world life experience and field activities. These strategies add the necessary components of engagement and hands-on activities to increase meaning and relevancy to our virtual and hybrid world. Examples will be shared from a summer field experience that has been carefully designed to expand collaborative learning in the biological sciences.",
