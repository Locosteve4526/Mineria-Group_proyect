        "Description/Abstract": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of s web-based  personalized normative feedback program, elettronic Check-Up to Go  (e-CHUG), in detreasing heavy drinking among 1st-year university  students. Results indicated high-risk students  reteiving the e-CHUG program during 1st-year orientation activities  reported significantly greater reductions in heavy drinking and  alcohol-related consequences than did students in an assessment-only  control group at a 3-month follow-up. Recommendations for integrating e-CHUG into orientation activities are discussed.",
