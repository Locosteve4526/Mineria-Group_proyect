        "Description/Abstract": "Research suggests that many counselors experience stress in the workplace. In fact, Sears and Navin (1983) reported that 14.8% of school counselors viewed counseling as &quot;very stressful,&quot; 50.4% rated it &quot;moderately stressful,&quot; and 30.1% found it &quot;mildly stressful.&quot; In addition, Arvay and Uhlemann (1996) reported that 16% of counselors working with trauma patients felt that they were highly psychologically fatigued. Just over a quarter (26%) reported that they were dissatisfied with their level of productivity at work, and 14% claimed to experience extreme stress levels similar to patients who have post-traumatic stress disorder.",
