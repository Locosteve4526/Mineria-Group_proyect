        "Description/Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can support nursing education but pose questions of validity, reliability, and ethical use. This article proposes using the five rights of nursing delegation framework by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing to teach nursing students about the appropriate use of LLMs in health care and nursing education. Nursing faculty can teach students how to assess the validity and reliability of the information provided by LLMs, document its use, and reference and cite information appropriately.",
