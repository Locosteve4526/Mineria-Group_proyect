        "Description/Abstract": "We have monitored volcanic explosions using a variety of multi-parametric approaches, focusing especially on seismo-acoustics and video velocimetry. Subtle precursory activity, starting seconds to tens of seconds prior to explosions, is often overlooked using standard observational methods because these signals are often small relative the main shocks. In this study we show how small signals prior to the initial blasts are significant and reveal important physical insight into the separation of the seismic and infrasonic signals. We show how energy partitioning at volcanic explosions in numerous situations can be explained by diverse (at least two) physical models that produce the observed signals. Furthermore, dynamical models of the precursory signals provides insight into the rheological properties in the explosion vent areas. Detailed studies at Santiaguito and Sakurajima show how multi-parametric analysis leads to integrated dynamic models of the volcanic explosions. By contrast, volcanoes like Karymsky do not exhibit similar precursory signals and thus represent completely different physical dynamics.",
