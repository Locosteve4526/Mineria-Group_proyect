        "Description/Abstract": "Jozef Przytycki introduced skein modules of $3$-manifolds and skein deformation initiating algebraic topology based on knots.  \nWe discuss the generalized skein modules of Walker, defined by fields and local relations.\nSome results by Przytycki are proven in a more general setting of fields defined by decorated cell-complexes in manifolds. \nA construction of skein theory from embedded TQFT-functors is given, and the corresponding background is developed.\nThe possible coloring the fields by elements of TQFT-modules is discussed for those generalized skein modules. \nAlso an approach of defining skein modules from studying compressions of fields is described.
