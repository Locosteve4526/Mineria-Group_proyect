        "Description/Abstract": "Chronic inflammation has been recognized as a risk factor for the development and maintenance of malignant disease. Cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) promote the development of both acute and chronic inflammation while promoting  metrics of breast cancer metastasis. However, anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-1\u03b2 therapeutics have not yielded significant results against solid tumors in clinical trials. Here we show that these three cytokines are interrelated in expression. Using the Curtis TCGA\u2122 dataset, we have determined that there is a correlation between expression levels of OSM, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 and reduced breast cancer patient survival ( = 0.6,  = 2.2 x 10). Importantly, we confirm that OSM induces at least a 4-fold increase in IL-6 production from estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer cells in a manner that is dependent on STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, OSM induces STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-1\u03b2 promotes p65 phosphorylation to synergistically induce IL-6 secretion in ER- MDA-MB-231 and to a lesser extent in ER+ MCF7 human breast cancer cells. Induction may be reduced in the ER+ MCF7 cells due to a previously known suppressive interaction between ER and STAT3. Interestingly, we show in MCF7 cells that ER's interaction with STAT3 is reduced by 50% through both OSM and IL-1\u03b2 treatment, suggesting a role for ER in mitigating STAT3-mediated inflammatory cascades. Here, we provide a rationale for a breast cancer treatment regime that simultaneously suppresses multiple targets, as these cytokines possess many overlapping functions that increase metastasis and worsen patient survival.",
