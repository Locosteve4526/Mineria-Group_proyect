        "Description/Abstract": "I completed a two week collecting trip in February in Jamaica to collect species of Columnea. As a result of that work, in conjuntion with Maggie Ooi (undergraduate) and Lacie Schulte (graduate) of Boise State University and Keron Campbell (Institute of Jamaica) we obtained all but one of the 13 endemic species.  These materials will be the basis for additional research on the genus Columnea.",
