        "Description/Abstract": "This chapter outlines a theoretical framework for the microscopic approach to material transport in liquid mixtures, and applies that framework to binary one-phase systems. The material transport in this approach includes no hydrodynamic processes related to the macroscopic transfer of momenta. In analyzing the current state of thermodynamic theory, we indicate critically important refinements necessary to use non-equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in the application to material transport in nonisothermal mixtures.",
