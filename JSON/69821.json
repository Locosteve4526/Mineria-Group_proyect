        "Description/Abstract": "A magnetic shape memory (MSM) microfluidic device may include a flexible membrane positioned between a channel and an MSM element. The MSM element may engage the flexible membrane to deform the channel at portions of the flexible membrane that are adjacent to non-contracted por\u00adtions of the MSM element. The flexible membrane may prevent contact between a fluid within the channel and the MSM element. Magnetic field components may be applied to the MSM element and moved along the MSM element enable fluidic flow within the channel while. The device may include an upper portion including the flexible membrane and a lower portion including the MSM element. The upper portion may be interchangeable with additional upper por\u00adtions.",
