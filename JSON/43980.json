        "Description/Abstract": "Introduction:\nAdvances in the care and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) have led to improved mortality rates; therefore, considerably more patients with CF are living into adulthood. Among other treatments, medical nutrition therapy is required and research has found that social, behavioral, and physical factors influence the ability of CF patients to follow dietary recommendations. A socio-economic factor that has not been adequately investigated with regards to dietary compliance of CF patients is food insecurity. \nObjective:\nThe aim of this case study was to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity among CF patients residing in Idaho. The correlation between food insecurity and health outcomes (lung functioning and body mass index) was also explored. \nMethods:\nConducted between August 2013 and March 2015, all data was collected using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system. Participants included adult patients and parents of children with CF. All participants (n= 87), patients of the St. Luke\u2019s Cystic Fibrosis Center of Idaho, were volunteers. During their regular quarterly visit, patients or parents of children with CF completed a computer-based survey; body fat measurements were also collected. In patients over the age of six, a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 ) using a MicroLoop spirometer was assessed using predicted equations from the National Health and Nutrition Examination III (NHANES III). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI calculator was employed for this study. For validity, the survey questions drew from the Mountain West CF Consortium Questionnaire (MWCFCQ) tool, which was designed to help identify and test educational interventions of nutrition management for parents of children with CF. The Institutional Review Board at St. Luke Health System evaluated and approved all aspects of the study. \nConclusion:\nFood insecurity rates among CF patients were found to be significantly higher compared to the community-at-large; however, no specific correlation between food insecurity and BMI or lung function emerged. The degree of food insecurity in both study groups, adults with CF and parents of children with CF (43% and 33%), was notably and statistically significantly above state levels (15%) (Idaho Food Bank. http://idahofoodbank.org/news-blog/food-insecurity-in-idaho. 2015.)  Furthermore, the prevalence of food insecurity was higher than reported by an earlier study conducted in other states in the Mountain West region of the United States (26.3%) (McDonald CM, et al.  Infant Child Adolescent Nutrition. 2009; I(6), 325-331.) This case study highlights the need for continued research around food access issues and this patient population, as well as the value of CF advocacy organizations promoting efforts to address food insecurity issues.
