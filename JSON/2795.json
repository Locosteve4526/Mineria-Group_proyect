        "Description/Abstract": "Accurate natural resource damage assessment necessitates monitoring  organisms or communities that respond most sensitively to contaminants.  Observational studies have demonstrated a correlation between fluvial  heavy metal deposition and hyporheic microbial community structure. To  establish a causal relationship between sediment metal content and the  structure of colonizing bacterial communities, we performed a controlled  field experiment. River sediments of 1.75?2.36 mm in diameter with five  different contaminant concentrations were collected from an  environmental metal contamination gradient. Sediments were sterilized  and then recolonized by incubation in the hyporheic zone of an  uncontaminated river (i.e., a common garden experiment was performed). A  significant correlation between hyporheic microbial community structure  and heavy metal contamination (R2 = 0.81) was  observed. The abundance of two phylogenetic groups was highly correlated  with the level of heavy metal contamination (Group I, R2 = 0.96; Group III, R2 = 0.96, most closely affiliated with the ?- and ?-proteobacteria,  respectively). Microbial community structural responses were detected at  metal concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those previously  reported to impact benthic macroinvertebrate communities. We conclude  that hyporheic microbial communities could offer the most sensitive  method for assessing natural resource damage in lotic ecosystems in  response to fluvial heavy metal deposition.",
