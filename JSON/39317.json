The Gelatin Plate as a Significant Art Teaching Tool&quot; with local printmaker, WingTip Press founder, and Boise State alumna, Amy Nack at the National Art Education Association Convention in New York. Participants discovered the extraordinary potential for gelatin printmaking as an accessible, versatile tool for meaningful curriculum with early to advanced learners and brainstormed ways to apply this new practice within their current art curricula.",
