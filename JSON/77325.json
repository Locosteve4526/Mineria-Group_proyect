        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs are embedded in social structures that often constrain (but also enable) their actions. To achieve upward social mobility, it may be necessary for entrepreneurs to act as change agents to transform these social structures. This suggests a theoretical puzzle called the paradox of embedded agency, where entrepreneurs must reshape the very structures that formed them. In this study, we argue that structural rigidity and entrepreneurial agency vary considerably across Williamson\u2019s four-level institutional hierarchy, which implies that the relationship between structure and agency is not paradoxical. We interviewed a sample of institutional entrepreneurs in the blockchain industry in Kenya and found that institutional level significantly effected the perceived ability to transform social structures.&lt;/p&gt;",
