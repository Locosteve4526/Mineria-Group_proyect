        "Description/Abstract": "Katherine Mansfield\u2019s claim that she and Elizabeth von Arim are \u201cworms of the same family\u201d would seem a curious analogy (Diary 46). But this deprecatory trope aligning the writer\u2019s perspective with an insect\u2019s, nonetheless, uses commonly held assumptions to interrogate gendered subjectivity and class dichotomies in the postwar world. In \u201cThe Fly,\u201d Mansfield depicts a businessman distracted by the seemingly harmless entertainment of dousing a housefly with ink; his god-like play with the fly evokes an attempt to master trauma\u2014the loss of his son in the war, his consequent lack of purpose, and his complicity. Likewise, Mabel Waring in Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cThe New Dress\u201d compulsively repeats an image she\u2019s conjured of a fly crossing a saucer as a bulwark against the sense of irrelevance she feels in upper-class  society. In Kangaroo, D.H. Lawrence\u2019s writer Richard Somers faces a dark night of the soul trying on and rejecting different ideologies in order to secure a sense of purpose in his work; he sees himself as a fly harrowingly climbing up and continually falling back into a pot of spikenard. Each protagonist considers or takes on the point of view of a housefly, attempting to master a trauma that, seen fully, would threaten his or her identity. These scenes should be an affective climax, however, as the deprecating choice of a housefly suggests, they are instead moments not of epiphany or emotional release but of existential impasse. \r\n\r\n",
