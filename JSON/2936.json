        "Description/Abstract": "Augustine\u2019s autobiographical Confessions (1909) contains one of the first accounts of a child learning to speak. This account, in turn, is central to Klaus Mollenhauer\u2019s Forgotten Connections: On Culture and Upbringing (1983/in press), a book internationally regarded as one of the most important German contributions to philosophy of education and curriculum theory in the 20th century. This book\u2019s interpretation of Augustine\u2019s description, as well as its divergence from an earlier interpretation by Wittgenstein in his Philosophical Investigations (1953) form the initial focus of this paper, which undertakes close readings of both approaches to Augustine. We argue that Wittgenstein\u2019s account, while quite similar to that of Mollenhauer, arrives at an impasse, particularly insofar as training (Abrichtung), education and upbringing is concerned. In his subsequent attempt to \u201crescue\u201d Augustine from Wittgenstein\u2019s critique, Mollenhauer develops three highly original notions that are central to his own understanding of upbringing: presentation, representation and Bildsamkeit. Significantly, the divergence of Mollenhauer\u2019s and Wittgenstein\u2019s interpretations also throws into sharp relief Mollenhauer\u2019s particular, dialogical and pedagogical interpretation of \u201cthe call,\u201d as it is originally articulated in Augustine.",
