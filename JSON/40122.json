        "Description/Abstract": "With the implicit understanding that students will use the book (even if we tell them not to) and that they can use a search engine to find any and all sorts of factual information, we have developed an entirely different way of going about the problem of assessment and \u201ccheating.\u201d  Rather than trying to \u201ccatch\u201d students with increasingly complicated technology, we present instead an alternative vision for considering online course assessments.  \n\nOur presentation will invite participants to think differently about the goals and objectives of class assessments of all types, offer examples of assessments we have developed specifically for online classes, and then provide opportunities for discussion and development of assessment questions for a variety of subject matters where it doesn\u2019t matter if students use the book\u2026 because the answer the assessment seeks isn\u2019t there.\n",
