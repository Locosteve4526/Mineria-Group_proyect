        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has continued to advance at a stunning pace since our last publication on GenAI in education in spring 2023. In that first article of a two-part series, we discussed the overall dynamic frontier of GenAI, its potential uses and benefits in education, the essential abilities required in the age of GenAI, and the associated issues and concerns surrounding this emerging technology. In this second article, we delve deeper to examine the new developments, stances, policies, and initiatives pertaining to GenAI's roles in education in international contexts.&lt;/p&gt;",
