        "Description/Abstract": "The Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11, Title I \u2013 Subtitle F) designated 518,000 acres of public lands in Owyhee County in southwestern Idaho as Wilderness and 324.5 miles of southern Idaho waterways as Wild and Scenic rivers (WSR). The Bureau of Land Management was thus required to create a Management Plan for these lands.  Section 3 (d)(1) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA) requires a Comprehensive Rivers Management Plan to address user capacities. Visitor or user capacity is the actual level of visitor use that will not adversely impact river values or other desired conditions. This visitor capacity will address the amount and type of use compatible with desired conditions and outstandingly remarkable values (ORVs). The outstanding values are based on agency studies and stakeholder input and the simple goal of designation is to protect these values. The process of deriving a meaningful numerical capacity is a useful tool for visitor use management, such as monitoring changes in use patterns. However, managers must recognize that the amount of visitor use is only one of many factors that influences impact and may be less important than other variables, such as the behavior of users or how and where use is distributed (W&amp;SR Use Capacity Direction, BLM WSR Manual 8351 rel.8-61).",
