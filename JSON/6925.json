        "Description/Abstract": "McCarl discusses, primarily through his own personal experiences, how the oppositional techniques of cultural work itself can provide a critique of work while at the same time develop a cooperative relationship with workers to articulate views and strategies that fit their needs. The conferences and the establishment of the fund in Occupational Folklife at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill acknowledge the high standards in this field set by Archie Green, an advocate of labor studies research. In order to maintain those standards, cultural workers musk ask hard questions of themselves and their positions within the ranks of contemporary and future cultural workers.",
