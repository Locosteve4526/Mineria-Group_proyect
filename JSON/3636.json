        "Description/Abstract": "This article describes a promising model in comprehensive special  education personnel preparation to support the recruitment and retention  of special education teachers in rural areas. The approach draws on  several bodies of research to include best practices for teacher  education, online service delivery, collaboration among key  stakeholders, and the development of strong mentoring and induction  programs. The implementation plan, based on evidence-based practice in  special education and online learning, is presented. A key element of  this plan is developing and maintaining strong relationships among rural  districts, the state department of education, and higher education.",
