        "Description/Abstract": "Salmonellosis is a food-borne illness caused by the bacteria Salmonella enterica. Salmonellosis can lead to diarrhea, fever, chills, and abdominal pain, and can cause systemic illness and death. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that Salmonella causes about 1.2 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations, and 450 deaths in the U.S. each year. A major strain of Salmonella that causes illness and is isolated from hospitalized patients is S. enterica Typhimurium DT104. DT104 is hypervirulent, multi-antibiotic-resistant, and expresses an enterotoxin with homology to other AB5 toxins. We hypothesize that this toxin, ArtAB, contributes to the pathogenicity seen in DT104. ArtAB has been cloned and purified from E. coli. Our previous purification technique used a series of salt solutions and fetuin-agarose to affinity purify the toxin. We have developed a new method using D-galactose agarose to bind toxin released from the E. coli periplasm and 1M D-galactose to elute the toxin from the column. The resulting purified toxin was dialyzed, concentrated and used in vitro on Vero tissue culture cells to determine toxin activity. These assays use the dyes Alamar Blue and Crystal Violet to detect cell proliferation or death. Results indicate that purified ArtAB has a slow cytotoxicity on these cells at higher concentrations. We have also begun in vitro ADP-ribosylation assays to assess toxin activity. The goals of these studies are to characterize the activity of ArtAB to determine its role as a virulence factor in Salmonella infection and aid in the prevention of this important disease. \n",
