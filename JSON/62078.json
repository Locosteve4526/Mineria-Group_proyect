        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;This note reviews the targeting performance of Bolsa Fam\u00edlia and its impact on inequality, poverty, consumption, education, health care, and labor force participation. Bolsa Fam\u00edlia has several design and implementation characteristics that distance it from a pure human-capital-based conditional cash transfer model. For that reason, we compare the impact of Bolsa Fam\u00edlia to that of other conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile. We show that, as have other programs, Bolsa Fam\u00edlia has helped reduce inequality and extreme poverty and has improved education outcomes, without having a negative impact on labor force participation. Where the program has failed to have its intended impact, in health and nutrition, supply-side constraints seem to be the principal problem.&lt;/span&gt;",
