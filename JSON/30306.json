        "Description/Abstract": "The one on a one-dollar bill signifies a quantitive measure of that\r\none\u2019s symbolic energy \u2013 what we would normally call its value. In the absence\r\nof energy, life cannot form. Just as nature abhors a vacuum, we learn to abhor\r\na debt. This understanding of value and debt informs the larger framework of\r\nanalysis used to examine the seemingly never-ending U.S. Presidential campaign of 2016. While many argue that Hillary Clinton represented the maintenance of the status quo, this paper points to evidence supporting a different conclusion. In the first place, to what status quo could they be referring? Second of all, as I argue here, a Clinton presidency would have signaled a coup of sorts. As WikiLeaks summarized it: \u201cThere is no election. There is power consolidation.\u201d With the U.S. executive brought into the consolidation of and around energy, what has become the status quo in Syria would have intensified and WWIII\r\nwould have been unavoidable.",
