        "Description/Abstract": "This is the second article of a two-part series regarding nursing faculty and student perceptions of incivility in nursing education in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Nursing faculty from the United States of America (USA) and the PRC collaborated to conduct this empirical study. A sample of 382 Chinese nursing faculty and students responded to 4 open-ended questions on the Incivility in Nursing Education (INE) Survey. Both groups reported similar perceptions of uncivil behaviors, contributors to incivility, and ways to address the problem. A conceptual model for fostering civility in nursing education was adapted to illustrate the findings.\n\n",
