        "Description/Abstract": "This transdisciplinary workshop explores the power of musicking in classrooms and communities focused on social justice. Activists from US Civil Rights, Anti- Apartheid, and Estonian independence movements ascribe the success of their revolutions to participatory musicking (singing and dancing). Workshop leaders highlight this power and vitality of activist-academic communities in song and motion,and share how to bring it into classrooms with a focus on revolution, resistance, and social justice. Expressive exercises will reveal the power of musicking to turn scholarship into community, activism, and solidarity.",
