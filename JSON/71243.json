        "Description/Abstract": "Introduction and Objective:\u00a0The United States has no\u00a0government-mandated paid maternity leave policy despite evidence supporting paid parental leave on health outcomes, including maternal mental health outcomes. State-level policy for parental leave has resulted in large discrepancies. The purpose of this project was to systematically review and evaluate\u00a0the impact of family leave policy and audit state legislation related to paid leave to highlight the variability in the US. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods:\u00a0 A systematic review was conducted of published studies on parental leave&lt;br&gt;policy within the United States. Studies that met criteria were evaluated for quality&lt;br&gt;assessment and narrative reporting occurred for extracted data. A policy audit was&lt;br&gt;conducted for state legislation on paid family leave, specifically related to the birth or&lt;br&gt;adoption of a child, for each of the 50 states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results: Sixty studies are included in the review. Data analysis is in progress. Preliminary results show there has been a rapid increase in the number of states passing and proposing paid leave legislation. Although not all states have had success in passing legislation, only 5 states have not proposed legislation to increase family leave policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions: Paid family policy following the birth or adoption of a child are linked with&lt;br&gt;positive health outcomes, including maternal mental health. Increasingly, there are calls&lt;br&gt;for legislation to provide paid leave at a state-level. Discrepancies in leave policy may&lt;br&gt;continue to result in disparities for those in states without policies and should be&lt;br&gt;addressed at a federal government level.",
