        "Description/Abstract": "Abstract: Garoufalidis and Loebl define a state model for the colored Jones polynomial from state summation on a graph with vertices defined by overcrossing arcs and edges defined by transitions at projection vertices. Their proof involves  quite difficult combinatorial arguments starting with the formula for the classical Jones polynomials. We give a new proof of their result in the case of braid projections by establishing a direct 1-1 correspondence between the state sets of the usual state model from the colored Jones polynomial R-matrix and the states on the Garoufalidis-Loebl graph. We can show that state contributions correspond to each other, thereby showing a direct equivalence of the two state models.\nOur proof is technical but elementary. It allows us to extend the formula to links. We derive explicit formulas for state sums for some infinite families of links. \nWe also have a conjecture stating that the non-commutative state model of Armond (based on work of Huynh-Le) dominates the usual state model in a precise way.
