        "Description/Abstract": "Buried layers of ancient soil organic matter (SOM) occur throughout much of North America, Europe, and Asia, storing significant amounts of carbon (C). However, erosion may expose this C to modern surface conditions, altering the surrounding biotic and abiotic environment. These changes may enhance the decomposition of ancient C by triggering microbial activity and respiration, thereby increasing the flux of soil C into the atmosphere. Root-derived C inputs and nitrogen (N) deposition can be key factors in ancient C decomposition as exposure to surface conditions increase, however, changes in labile soil C and N inputs to ancient C decomposition along an erosional gradient remain uncertain. Our research aims to evaluate the vulnerability of ancient C stored within paleosols when exposed to C and N inputs. Our field site is in Wauneta, NE where erosion has uncovered areas of a Pleistocene era soil. Formed 10-13 kya, the Brady soil occurs throughout the landscape along erosional toposequences and was collected from 0.2m, 0.4m and 1.2m depths below the surface. The soil was homogenized, root picked, and held at 60% water holding capacity to assess microbial activity in a controlled laboratory incubation study. To evaluate effects of modern root-derived C inputs and N deposition on Brady C decomposition, we applied (1) a lab synthesized root exudate solution to mimic root exudates (0.3 mg C g-1\u00adsoil) and (2) ammonium nitrate to simulate atmospheric (wet + dry) and wind-blown agricultural N deposition (30 kg ha-1). The exudate solution was 13C labeled (12 atom% 13C), allowing us to partition between the decomposition of root exudate C and Brady soil C. We calculated microbial CO2 respiration, N mineralization and enzymatic activity on days 0, 3, 14 and 30. Significant increases in soil respiration with root exudate addition \u2013 particularly at the shallowest depth \u2013 suggest that the ancient Brady C is vulnerable to decomposition when exposed to surface conditions.",
