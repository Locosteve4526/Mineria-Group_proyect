        "Description/Abstract": "[\u2026] Illustrating the scope and nature of this vast American field with any accuracy or depth is a difficult if not impossible task. Even the most active researcher can be conversant with, perhaps, only three or four areas in research \u2013 to say nothing of their correlative configuration in German-speaking Erziehungswissenschaft. Thus, even this briefest of overviews is bound by a limited, and at times, personal horizon.1 I address these limitations by making use of number of specific examples, beginning with ones defined by AERA\u2019s divisions and SIGs, and then by focusing on examples of terms and definitions that separate English- and German-speaking educational research on what might be called a \u201emacro-theoretical\u201c level.
