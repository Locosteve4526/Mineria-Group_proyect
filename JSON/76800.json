        "Description/Abstract": "This paper operationalizes the concepts of industrial robustness and economic resilience within a spatially explicit empirical analysis of regional economic performance. We measure industrial diversity, specialization, and modularity as an adaptive process throughout economic cycles. Cross-scale fixed effects models estimate the effects of industrial robustness on unemployment rates using U.S. county and commuting zone levels longitudinal employment data. We find that different combinations of regional specialization and comparative diversity encourage different rates of growth and economic resiliance in counties and commuting zones. These findings are valuable for policymakers implementing policies on industry mix and economic resilience.",
