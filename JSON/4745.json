        "Description/Abstract": "This article transcribes and analyzes newly recovered inscriptions in Herman Melville\u2019s copy of Dante\u2019s Commedia, or The Vision, as translated by Henry Francis Cary. Evidence consists of an erased and overwritten notation on \u201cthe Monk\u2019s Vision,\u201d an alleged manuscript source for the Commedia; a superimposed and partially-erased notation that excerpts and responds to Walter Savage Landor\u2019s criticism of The Inferno; and faded inscriptions illustrating (1) Melville\u2019s use of the image of the Trinity in the final canto of Paradise (and of Cary\u2019s accompanying commentary on Plato) as source material for crafting his own \u201cVision\u201d of the afterlife in chapter 188 of Mardi, \u201cBabbalanja Relates to Them a Vision,\u201d and (2) an extrapolation of the late President John Quincy Adams\u2019s position on slavery, and its correspondence to reflections on the subject in chapter 162 of Mardi, \u201cThey visit the extreme South of Vivenza.\u201d Through recovery of the inscriptions listed above, and in the absence of surviving manuscript documents for these two chapters, this article contributes to knowledge of Melville\u2019s source use by offering new facts about the effect of Melville\u2019s interpretation of Dante on his philosophically and religiously ambitious third novel.",
