        "Description/Abstract": "*Please note that the authors listed alphabetically starting with Davis contributed equally to this paper.\r\nPost-secondary education is expected to substantially contribute to the cognitive growth and professional achievement of STEM students.  Yet, there is limited understanding of how STEM students develop professionally.  We used the lens of self-authorship (Baxter Magolda, 1998) to develop an instrument to be used for large-scale assessment of STEM student professional identity development.  Through the process of instrument development, we assessed the relationship between the level of STEM students\u2019 perceptions of their professional identities and their educational experiences, learning preferences, and interaction with faculty comfort.  Our results indicate that several proxy questions may be useful for assessing STEM student professional identity development.  We also found a misalignment between students\u2019 perception of themselves as professionals and the expectations for their actions in professional situations.  We provide implications for our research and directions for on-going investigations.",
