        "Description/Abstract": "&lt;span&gt;Atlantic Gallery is very pleased to present TENUOUS THREADS, a two-part exhibition showcasing works incorporating textiles, fibers, threads and mixed media. Tenuous Threads alludes to the delicate lines that bring us together and sets us apart; that joins us yet repels us. All of life is connected through networks, systems, fibers and webs. Communication (visual, verbal, electrical, chemical, and kinetic) enables an exchange of information amongst all life forms. The exhibition includes innovative artworks that utilize textiles, fibers, threads (natural and synthetic) in sculpture, collage, 3D and 2D mixed media that communicates the strength and fragility of what binds all life.&lt;/span&gt;",
