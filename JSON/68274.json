        "Description/Abstract": "This presentation is intended to provide an overview of the integration of substance&lt;br&gt;use content into an RN-BS curriculum. Substance use in the United States increased&lt;br&gt;dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic and already alarmingly high, 13% of&lt;br&gt;Americans reported beginning or increasing use of substances during this time to&lt;br&gt;cope with pandemic associated stressors. Additionally, opioid deaths increased by&lt;br&gt;30% during this same period of time. Nurses care for patients experiencing substance&lt;br&gt;use disorder (SUD) in every healthcare setting and historically nursing curriculum has&lt;br&gt;not well-prepared students for caring for this vulnerable population. With the&lt;br&gt;increase in substance use, it is important that nurses are equipped with the&lt;br&gt;knowledge to provide care for this vulnerable population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Objectives:&lt;br&gt;\uf0b7 Discuss the need for substance use education in nursing curricula.&lt;br&gt;\uf0b7 Describe the integration and success of a substance use course into RN-BS&lt;br&gt;curriculum.&lt;br&gt;\uf0b7 Identify opportunities and resources for incorporating SUD into nursing&lt;br&gt;education.&lt;br&gt;\uf0b7 Share strategies on how SUD resources can be used to prepare students to&lt;br&gt;address SUD in practice.&lt;br&gt;\uf0b7 Share anonymous student feedback about the value of the course",
