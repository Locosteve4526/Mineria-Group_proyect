        "Description/Abstract": "The analysis of early Christian martyrdom as Christian identity represents a response to earlier \u2018pathological\u2019 explanations. Reacting to\u00a0the perceived moral judgement in earlier scholarship about the abnormality of martyrdom, the 'identity approach\u2019\u00a0grounds martyrdom instead in the socio-cultural self-construction of early Christians. However, in interpreting martyrdom primarily as a discourse for identity construction, this approach neglects the existential phenomenon of the martyr. Maintaining the existential implications of martyrdom is critical to anchor discussion of martyrdom as a\u00a0Christian identity discourse, specifically to understand the gap between the ideological function of martyr discourse\u2014for early Christians and early Christian scholars\u2014and the comparatively infrequent occurrence of martyrdom. Given the early Christian martyr\u2019s pride of place in most common understandings of martyrdom and the\u00a0present-day persistence of actual martyr-making in many ideological domains, relevant scholarship must attend to what made the martyr individually as well as how martyrdom constituted a form of identity discourse for early Christians. This approach will contribute to our understanding of the dialectical relationship between the phenomenon of martyrdom as identity and as event, as well as challenging the implicit\u00a0theological claim\u2014and cultural assumption\u2014that religious belief alone makes the martyr.",
