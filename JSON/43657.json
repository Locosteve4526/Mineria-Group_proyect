Is your administration asking for aggregated instruction statistics for courses taught by librarians no longer at your institution? \nManaging files in a proactive manner can save you from headaches and disaster, both professionally and personally. This session will help interested librarians with file naming, structure and organization, documentation, and appropriate sharing and preservation options.\n",
