        "Description/Abstract": "This study examined whether differences in waist circumference (WC) and  pedometer placement (anterior vs. midaxillary vs. posterior) affect the  agreement between pedometer and observed steps during treadmill and  self-paced walking. Participants included 19 pairs of youth (9-15 years  old) who were matched for sex, race, and height and stratified by WC  (high WC: HWC; low WC: LWC). Participants performed 3-min  treadmill-walking trials at speeds of 59, 72, and 86 m multiplied by  min[superscript -1] and a 400-m self-paced walking trial on level  ground. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement between  pedometer and observed steps of spring-levered pedometers by WC,  pedometer placement, and walking speed. In the HWC group, the posterior  pedometer placement consistently agreed most closely with observed steps  at all treadmill speeds and during self-paced walking. In the LWC  group, no single pedometer placement consistently agreed most closely  with observed steps at all treadmill speeds and during self-paced  walking. We conclude that a posterior pedometer placement improves  step-count accuracy in most youth with an HWC at a range of walking  speeds on level ground. (Contains 1 table and 5 figures.)",
