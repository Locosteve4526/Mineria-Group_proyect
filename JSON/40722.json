        "Description/Abstract": "This report is a follow-up to Re-Entry Outcomes in Federal Court: Court-Assisted Re-Entry (CARE) Pilot Program Outcome Evaluation (Omori, Lautenschlanger &amp; Lee, 2017), which evaluated outcomes for the first year of the pilot program, and Understanding Re-Entry in a Federal Court Context: Court-Assisted Re-Entry (CARE) Pilot Program Implementation Evaluation (Omori, Lautenschlager, Lee, Cancio, &amp; Martinez, 2016), which evaluated the implementation of the CARE program.\nThis report is comprised of four main sections. The first section describes the methods and sample for the CARE and comparison groups. The second section discusses the reasons for potential participants declining CARE. We include this section because recruitment and retention were some of the primary concerns for the CARE team during the pilot. The third section describes the quantitative outcomes and needs, largely drawn from the Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA) instrument. We then cover the services and community partnerships that served CARE participants, as well as other benefits of CARE, including reintegration and procedural justice, which is drawn from a combination of interviews conducted with CARE participants and the CARE team, and observations and notes taken during CARE team meetings. We conclude with suggestions for program improvements.",
