        "Description/Abstract": "How and when can a narrative agent or voice be considered unreliable? What happens when narrative authority fails and, just as importantly, why does it? As a means to answering these questions, Wandering Women in French Film and Literature examines the phenomenon of 'narrative drift' through in-depth analysis of twentieth-century novels and films. Combining feminist theories and structural narratology, Devereux Herbeck illustrates the ways in which evidence and/or admissions of doubt by narrative entities in works featuring wandering women disrupt conventions of continuity, coherence, and authority and thereby forces the story in new, unexpected directions.\nPage Number:  212",
