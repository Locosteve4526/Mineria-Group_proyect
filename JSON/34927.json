        "Description/Abstract": "The push toward voting via hand-marked paper ballots\r\nhas focused attention on the limitations of current optical\r\nscan systems. Discrepancies between human and machine\r\ninterpretations of ballot markings can lead to a loss of trust\r\nin the election process. In this paper, a style-based approach\r\nto ballot recognition is proposed in which marks are\r\nrecognized collectively rather than in isolation. The consistency\r\nof a voter\u2019s style is leveraged to improve the overall\r\naccuracy of the system. We compare style-based recognition\r\nto various kinds of singlet classifiers and show that it\r\noutperforms them by a substantial margin.",
