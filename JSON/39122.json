        "Description/Abstract": "On the five-year anniversary of the election of Pope Francis I, this article provides historical and theological analysis into how far Francis I might go in broadening women\u2019s ministerial and sacramental roles in the Church during his pontificate. Since his election in 2013, Francis I has engaged the estimated 1.2 billion Catholics and innumerable non-Catholics worldwide with his frank, inclusive talk on issues as diverse as poverty and homosexuality. Many observers seem confused by the Church\u2019s apparent willingness to reconsider its traditions regarding some issues\u2014like divorce and new roles for laypeople in ritual\u2014but not others\u2014such as women\u2019s ordination. How far could Pope Francis go in support of women in the Catholic priesthood?\r\n",
