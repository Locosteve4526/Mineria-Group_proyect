        "Description/Abstract": "This article examines three contemporary German reports of encounters with &quot;strange&quot;  and &quot;taboo&quot; food: a newspaper article about the perils of eating in China, a  biographical essay in which contemporary German novelist Birgit Vanderbeke discusses  historical changes in the culinary habits of postwar Germany, and a rather unusual  cookbook by the same author. These texts provide a snapshot of contemporary German  sensibilities regarding food, and they allow us to gain insights about the cultural  specificity of taste, historical shifts in our culinary value judgments, and the  impact of culinary globalization.",
