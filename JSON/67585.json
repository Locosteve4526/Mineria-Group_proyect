        "Description/Abstract": "Graphene - an atomically thin layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - has gained interest as a bioscaffold for tissue engineering due to its exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Graphene's structure and properties are tightly coupled to synthesis and processing conditions, yet their influence on biomolecular interactions at the graphene-cell interface remains unclear. In this study, C2C12 cells were grown on graphene bioscaffolds with specific structure-property- processing-performance (SP3) correlations. Bioscaffolds were prepared using three different methods - chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sublimation of silicon carbide (SiC), and printing of liquid phase exfoliated graphene. To investigate the biocompatibility of each scaffold, cellular morphology and gene expression patterns were investigated using the bipotential mouse C2C12 cell line. Using a combination of fluorescence microscopy and qRT-PCR, we demonstrate that graphene production methods determine the structural and mechanical properties of the resulting bioscaffold, which in turn determine cell morphology, gene expression patterns, and cell differentiation fate. Therefore, production methods and resultant structure and properties of graphene bioscaffolds must be chosen carefully when considering graphene as a bioscaffold for musculoskeletal tissue engineering.",
