        "Description/Abstract": "This book provides 18 lively commentaries on Lacan\u2019s Seminar VIII, Transference (1960-61) that explore its theoretical and philosophical consequences in the clinic, the classroom, and society. Including contributions from clinicians as well as scholars working in philosophy, literature, and culture studies, the commentaries presented here represent a wide-range of disciplinary perspectives on the concept of transference. This book is not a compendium to Lacan\u2019s seminar. Instead it attempts to capture through shorter contributions a spectrum of voices debating, deliberating, and learning with Lacan\u2019s concept. In doing so it can be seen to engage with transference conceptually in a manner that matches the spirit of Lacan\u2019s seminar itself. The book will provide an invaluable new resource for Lacan scholars working across the fields of psychoanalytic theory, clinical psychology, philosophy and cultural studies.",
