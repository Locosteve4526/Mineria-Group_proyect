        "Description/Abstract": "This article discusses the uses, experiments, and merits of geolocation applications for academic library outreach and instruction. SCVNGR is a game-based geolocation application. Users earn points or gain rewards by completing challenges and treks. Builders design challenges with text-based answers, quick response codes, or photo responses. Librarians at Boise State University and Oregon State University have built treks and challenges using SCVNGR for orientations and instruction. They have found SCVNGR a better environment than Foursquare to engage students with the library. SCVNGR is a convenient tool to use to get started with geolocation and gaming in library instruction; however, comparable tools are available.",
