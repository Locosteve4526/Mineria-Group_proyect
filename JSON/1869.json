        "Description/Abstract": "Eggs (n = 367) collected from wild Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum) nests between 1976 and 1990 in Colorado and New Mexico were artificially incubated and hatched. We retrospectively examined these data for variation in egg length, breadth, and initial mass of hatchlings to resolve questions about relationships among egg size, chick size, and sex; and egg size related to first and second clutches and years. Egg length and breadth were significantly related to chick mass at hatching. Neither egg size nor hatchling mass were related to sex. Egg breadth slightly increased and then decreased over the years eggs were collected, which possibly reflects a re-established and then aging wild falcon population or other environmental variation. We also evaluated clutch sex ratios relative to theory based on sexual size dimorphism and local resource competition. Sex ratios did not significantly differ from 1:1 within first or second clutches separately or when combined. Thus, Peregrine Falcons in this population apparently did not skew clutch sex ratios in accordance with local resource competition or Fisherian theory.",
